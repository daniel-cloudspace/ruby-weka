 hey there everyone just thought i d start another story starring one of the in famous weasley twins george because everyone loves them except if you don t well i ve been interested in this story for a long time so i just gonna try it now i writing this in harry 6th year before the hbp comes out so some things early on may not and probabaly wontgo along with hbp but i think that alright since technically this isnta story about harry in fact it may not have a lot of ron hermione or harry in it just a few appearances so i suppose you could call this au story title for good disclaimer if i were jkr and was about to make goodness only knows how much on my next book i highly doubt i would be writing this so dontsue me please also part of the summary the title is based on the song for good from the musical wicked chapter one meeting george it a pity you re a slytherin lexi it a pity you were a gryffindor george it a pity you re such a sneaky minx pity you re such an insensitive prankster pity my family would never approve pity my family would kill you and me that is a pity since i think i ve fallen in love with you yes i suppose it is since i seem to have fallen in love with you too do you regret anything i dontthink so you changed me for the better who can say if i ve been changed for the better no one i suppose i think i changed too i believe i have been changed for the better me too but who knows perhaps this will be the thing that does us in me anyways cheerful thought i do know one thing though what that i ve been changed for good that sweet uh hey don touch that bubble gum but i suppose some things never change i love you i love you too how else could i put up with you awe just ruin the moment just like you slytherins the moment was already ruined by you re newest invention typical gryffindor blames me i remember the day i met him the day my life changed forever the day my life changed for good of course i had heard of him gryffindor beater infamous prankster public enemy number two of slytherin house after of course harry potter and the two groupies he liked to call friends one half of the walking circus that was more commonly known asthe weasley twins but they didntknow me fortunately not that i hadntdone my fair share to make their lives hard draco and i were quite good friends although he preferred hanging out with crabbe and goyle since they were his puppets so i chose to converse with pansy we had it quite nicely as draco friends and members of very influential families we were treated very well by other slytherins we knew peoplelooked up to us and we used it to our advantage hm i suppose i could be called pretty draco always called me beautiful but he was always a dear to me we came to depend on each other for advice we were like brother and sister i was always told i was classified in the petite category i was roughly 5 2 and thin i did have a womanly figure though for which i was thankful for since i dreaded growing up to become a girl with no figure looking as boyish as possible i had ash blonde hair that fell down just a few inches past my shoulder in waves which i despised so i constantly straightened i had a small nose sprinkled with freckles i also had freckles on my shoulders a great embarrassment to me and something draco constantly teased me about i had a small mouth that often was formed into a mocking smirk i had large eyes that always appeared much too large for my face although my parents assured me i would grow into them but i didn t another point that draco teased me about i dontthink i was ever a hateful person i was mean but with due cause and a lot of the time i got really angry when people would look at my green scarf and glare at me before i had even done anything for all these muggles we re supposedly hating we sure seem to get a lot more discrimination than they do bloody babies but at that time i didntcare i was sneaky ambitious manipulative resourceful clever everything that a slytherin could be although i ll admit i wasntas clever as other students well i d admit it to myself but never to them every slytherin has to have some level of arrogance i was no different i had a cool demeanor and didntcare what other people thought of me because i was better than them and i had friends we laughed although sometimes it was at other people and we trusted each other which was something i always craved trust honesty most people wouldntthink a slytherin capable of wanting that but that was mostly because people choose to see what they wanted to i hadntknown that george would be any different boy was i wrong but anyways back to the day we met draco and i were staying diagon alley his father and my mother attended to some business they say this very delicately as if we dontknow what they mean their stupid death eater junk but i suppose since i part of the next generation i shouldntsay anything so shhhhhhh anywho it was about a month until draco and i went off to our sixth year at hogwarts and i could not wait because my bed in leaky cauldron had a spring loose and it poked me in the back every single night so that day draco and i decided it would be fun to invite crabbe and goyle to do some shopping well draco decided therefore i was shopping by myself but had promised to meet up with them at 3 o clock to grab a late lunch so as i was walking along on this warm summer day in muggle clothing since i obviously such a muggle hater geesh humming to myself i had just taken my kitten leila to the pet store the witch there was going to put a spell on her that would make her stay a kitten for much longer than she normally would some say this lengthens a cat life and makes it stronger and more immune i just think it ll make her lengthen her adorable ness thinking of how i would have a cute little kitten for such a long time i didntnotice a lot of my surroundings but i sure did get a wake up call when i smashed into someone oh ouch i winced having landed on the ground my bags scattering around me oh heh sorry about that a voice said above me sure you can laugh you re not the one sitting on your bum hoping your things dontget trampled whatever i muttered and started gathering my things lemme help you the voice said i rolled my eyes but he didntsee it yes he should help me it was his bleeding fault in the first place because he was definitely a guy his voice was deep and had a hint of amusement in it so after picking up half my bags and standing them next to me i stood up and quickly brushed my robes off i shook my head and looked up at the klutz who knocked me over intending to give him a piece of my mind good lord it a weasley one of the twins dontknow which dontreally care either just what i needed to cap off my day yeah but really i sorry about that you see i was running from he started to explain but i cut him off because i didntcare who he was running from it alright i said cooly but politely i wasntpaying attention to my surroundings he grinned at me and stuck out his hand i cringed inwardly but took it i knew i should ve been mean to him george weasley ah so it was george the one who beat draco up last year arse just because of a little song a song that i made up the tune to lexi i stated not offering a last name while shaking his hand i then started to walk past him hogwarts he asked walking alongside me yep i thought you said you were running from someone i asked eager for him to leave ah it alright what year are you in he brought the subject back 6th really my little brother is there too ron he looked at me yes i know and i dontthink he would appreciate you calling him little i glanced at him he wasntbad looking as far as redheads go certainly better looking than percy was yuck he looked a bit toned probably from quidditch and he always seemed to have a grin on his face his eyes had a sparkle to them and i couldntseem to stop looking at them you know ickle ronniekins he asked surprised i giggled which made him grin i know of him ickle ronniekins i asked thinking of all the ways this newfound nickname could make the youngest weasley squirm i thought as much because i would ve remembered if he would ve been hanging out with you george changed his grin into a smile oh please he honestly wasnttrying to flirt with me was he i raised my eyebrow at him amused so what do you know of him he asked mimicking me but not in a cruel way his eyes were still sparkling i know that i paused he a prefect with hermione granger and he has red hair and is tall and hangs out with harry potter i finished not much you know harry and hermione too or just of them we continued walking who doesntknow harry potter i asked and as for hermione i know about as much about her as ron prefect smart tight laced george laughed at that one hangs out with the other two oh and she went to the yule ball with viktorkrum this was about as much as i wanted to know about all three of them but if george had an embarrassing nickname for them as well i certainly wouldntobject to hearing it tight laced that would be her alright i laughed seeing a gryffindor talk about the perfect prefect granger like that she gave me a detention once i dontthink i like her very much i commented why d she give you a detention george was curious well i was out past curfew and i suppose i did make some insinuations about her and your brother involving a broom closet george bust into laughter and we stopped but honestly they bicker like an old married couple george had stopped laughing but a smile was still on his face no wonder she gave you a detention even i know not to say that to her i looked at my watch as pleasant and informative as this discussion was i still didntlike hanging out with a gryffindor a former gryffindor well i have to go george looked a bit put out see ya stop by my shop sometime he said i shrugged sometime maybe i turned to walk away i looked over my shoulder george was watching me go george i started i was rather impressed by you re grand exit last year he looked quite please with himself really yeah just thought you d like to know i smiled and walked away thinking of picking up my kitten before leaving to meet draco my smiled widened as i thought of going back to hogwarts perhaps i could ask draco to instigate a little fight with weasley ickle ronniekins i thought with a laugh george wasntso bad though for a gryffindor never understood why they were in that house full of goody goodies anyways but he was a gryffindor i was a slytherin maybe i should check out his shop just to see how stupid it is because i lexi conrad did not associate with riff raff like the weasleys and their comrades granger and potter and i didntthink i wanted to start either i ve heard things nothing but trouble comes from that potter boy bloody boy who lived gets so much attention because he has a dent in his head shouldntthink that potter is very important to our cause my parents cause that what makes me different i suppose i dontwhole heartedly support voldemort when this war heats up though i need to choose a side and i will i ll choose the side that will keep me alive hey guys hope you enjoyed review please it would mean so much and lift my spirit next chapter george finds out lexi is a slytherin and isntpleased lexi stops at the joke shop and runs into the golden trio and gets very very disgruntled darn this is only 7 pages sorry next one ll be longer i promise well i back heck yes i really sorry and i dontblame you guys if you ve stopped reading i really don t i have my reasons for not updating including lack of computer for about 3 months but that really isnta valid excuse so i ll just apologize and try and write a killer chapter of course j thanks to my reviewers you guys are what made me decide to continue this story oh and by the way on the 2nd i actually went and saw wicked my inspiration for this story amazing absolutely wonderful i cried thanks to the following reviewers captain speed o southernsweetdevil adrilily sarah now chapter time yes chapter 9 bitter disappointment and fights okay so wait what you re saying is that i going to your house the day after christmas i asked draco george and i had been going out for about a week and a half secretly of course and honestly well i was having the time of my life george was just so funny and sweet and charming and donteven get me started on his hair lexi lexi draco poked me hey genius i trying to answer your question here oh sorry i grinned no i wasntthinking about george or anything certainly not not me no way yeah you are coming to my house okay draco asked obviously irritated that he hadntbeen able to hold my attention well that should be fun i commented we can get lost in that awful hedge maze of yours draco laughed more like you can get lost i know my way around it yeah only because you blast your way through the hedges i answered back draco house is huge i mean really huge and in his gardens his parents thought it would be fun to put a hedge maze in it wasnt i got lost and draco annihilated the hedges trying to find me i was quite flattered that he took such an interest in my well being actually so it called thinking on your feet alexis dear he drawled smirking at me what it called drakey is being lazy and unable to solve a simple problem i quipped back i would ve found my way out eventually shut up it wouldnthave taken me that long really i seriously i was nearly out of there honestly you got a detention you got detention draco smirked never thought i d see the day i gaped but how who i mean really you re a well draco finished chang you re a goody goody let not sugarcoat it draco stop being mean i said so what did you do cho i smirked were you being disobedient to be honest cho getting a detention was really strange i mean really really out of the ordinary it would be like granger hair not being frizzy for crying out loud i didntreally do anything i just really had to go to the bathroom and trelawney wouldntlet me so i kind of swore at her cho finished i burst into laughter she wouldntlet you go draco asked what was she doing holding you hostage she said that i had to stay or else when i got back my inner eye wouldntbe in sync with the aura of the room cho trailed off looking bewildered i wasntaware my inner eye even worked dontworry i feel mine is often taking a vacation draco said grinning at a group of ravenclaw 4th years your mind is often taking a vacation draco i smirked and dontstare at 4th years it creepy look who talking draco muttered weasley two year older than you shut up i whispered frantically i do not want anyone to hear draco smirked embarrassed i frowned more like not looking forward to the opinion of our classmates i paused especially those hotheaded gryffindors not saying i couldnttake them i could believe me you should have thought about that before i swear i dontknow why i bother fraternizing with you you ll be the shame of our house draco shook his head at me shut up you love me and even if you didn t you re stuck with me i replied grinning hey guy i ll see you i going to head to the library cho waved then walked off towards the staircase boy she just a bundle of fun draco yawned shut up she nice and she a girl i tired of hanging around so much testosterone i replied now what do you want to do oh you mean you arentgoing off to see your little boyfriend draco raised his eyebrows at me no i not and i wish you would stop being so mean to me about this it my choice not yours i not a child i stopped glaring at him well lexi i just dontthink it a good idea you donteven know the weasel and up until a few months ago you couldntstand him draco pointed out ugh i really dontwant to fight with draco right now draco let drop it okay if i get my heart broken or whatever then you can say i told you so but until i do just let me handle things okay i paused please draco sighed alright but you had better not become some emotional heartbroken loser you re too good for that since that was about as close to complimentary draco got i decided to let the rudeness of the comment slide m kay i said now let go sit out by the lake well it was saturday supposedly the most fun day of the week not for lexi oh no my saturday are always cursed somehow it like the powers that be hate me i was by myself draco decided it would be fun to make the hufflepuff plates hover above their heads ultimately falling on them all at the same time therefore he got a detention i was furious that he hadntasked me to help and as a result wasnttalking to him anyway blaise was hanging out with cho which seemed pretty strange to me but i wasntgoing to bother them and pansy was on a date apparently she thought she could make draco jealous which if i may say is a long shot anyway so i had nothing to do no one to hang out with and normally i would go and find george but he at the shop this weekend hmph well i cantjust hang around the common room all day i said to myself because breathing in all that mold cant be good for your system but where to go you know hogwarts has suddenly become much more boring in the past months what wrong lexi pansy came bounding in i just got back from my date she sighed dramatically draco not here pans i said simply she dropped the act ugh it was awful honestly she plopped down next to me he took me dancing but he had two left feet oh darn well that never good i said my path to the door still set sorry but i was just heading out oh really where to pansy asked getting up uhm well probably just walking around you know nothing special i said sweetly praying that she wouldntcome with me ugh well i dontthink i could walk around anywhere my feet are killing me she said dropping back down onto the couch someone up there must love me well i ll be back in a bit i said smiling sympathetically poor pansy i really do sympathize bad dancing can really kill your feet but anyway i left the common room wondering what i was going to do with myself i decided to take a little trip outside to clear my thoughts however i heard hushed voices arguing as i came up from the dungeons curious i hid behind a suit of armor it was wait gaaaah i cantsee i turned trying to adjust my position after i had made myself more comfortable i peeked out and saw ginny and potter ginny and potter fighting to me it had always seemed that ginny and potter were the two most level headed when it came to their little group seeing them fight was kind of strange to say the least and i dontcare what you say they have no right to know what you only suspect ginny snapped potter looked equally irritated all i saying is you canthelp but notice something between them it completely obvious he said rolling his eyes weasley and granger that what they were talking about i was sure apparently ginny and potter noticed the sexual tension between the two and were debating on whether or not to confront them in an effort to further their relationship i personally sided with gingersnap nothing good comes of having your friends try and solve couple problems honestly harry what good can come of us telling hermione and ron that something may or may not be going on between lexi and george ginny whispered furiously what are you kidding me how can potter even think that would be a remotely good idea how does potter even know even suspect that anything would be going on with george and i i wanted to jump out and yell at him right then and there but decided that that wouldntbe the most intellectual thing to do the main reason was that it would increase his suspicions about my possible relationship with george so i restrained myself barely it wontcause anything but endless interrogation of george and it ll just cause way more trouble with lexi than we want you know if they start hounding her malfoy will round up his goons and come to her defense ginny continued we dontneed that kind of trouble but potter began but ginny cut him off and besides i dontsee the problem george is a big boy he can look out for himself and you ve even said lexi isntthat bad ginny continued i decided at that moment that i would do something really nice for the little weasley bake her a cake maybe i d have to learn how to bake one first but look i not trying to say anything against lexi we all know she isntthat bad even if she tries to be what i am saying however is that she still a slytherin she still best friends with malfoy and she isntexactly receptive to any of george friends potter paused we know that as much as george tries to act like he isn t he a hopeless romantic he digs himself into thing that he cantget out of lexi for the most part seems pretty much emotionless let be honest about this gin they wontlast and george will be the one to get hurt it would better to just end it now potter finished ginny opened her mouth to respond but i cut in stupid me stupid stupid lexi potter shut up i growled first of all i am completely filled with emotions i feeling one right now three guesses what it is potter cocked an eyebrow anger anger border lining on absolute rage i finished i dont appreciate what you said at all give me something to suggest it isnttrue he replied cooly i gaped at him pompous jerk if i had known potter better i would ve maybe realized he was baiting me but then i thought he was just being as asinine as his dorky little friends fuck you potter i dont need to explain my feeling to you or anyone else unless i want to i dontlike a lot of people i admit it but if i didntreally care about i stumbled if i didntcare i wouldntwaste my time i finished coldly i felt a bit confused here i was trying to justify my feeling to harry potter harry potter my best friend mortal enemy well not mortal enemy that sounds so extreme rival maybe lexi you donthave to ginny drifted off looking as confused as i felt i know i don t but i am and i dontknow why i scoffed maybe i getting soft potter smirked conrad you were never that hard to begin with shut up stop it i dontknow who you think you are talking to me like this my this with it changes nothing i said fiercely i not going to become your friend leave me alone potter just continued to grin no problem and thanks for what i muttered you just won over my complete approval he said walking away what a jerk like i sought it out or something like i even thought that i needed it like i care potter i called weakly to his retreating back i turned to ginny he had better keep his mouth shut you cantkeep it a secret forever she said bluntly well give the girl a galleon obviously i knew that i know i said firmly i just this needs to be done delicately you cantsay it isntunusual and it wontexactly be accepted positively i finished lamely well you guys need to think of something before anyone else catches on ginny said simply and walked away i am not baking her a cake not not not i wasntstupid i knew what needed to be done it was just hard could anyone blame me neither george or i could benefit in any way from this relationship except for the fact that it made us happy which is supposed to be the only thing that mattered pshh whoever thought that theory up obviously never had to deal with social groups and family feuds sigh i could tell something was definitely going to blow up in my face i could only hope i wouldntget burnt too badly i was in the library with blaise and draco when the subject of george and i was next broached lexi draco asked quietly i looked up from my essay on partial human transfiguration hmm i responded pushing a strand of hair out of my face have you told blaise yet draco whispered to me i looked at blaise who was trying to solve an arithmancy problem he was working so hard that he didntnotice the slight smudge of ink he had gotten on his cheek about what i said turning back to draco about you and you know draco said raising his eyebrows me and oh i paused me and george yes clever girl draco replied sarcastically rolling his famous grey eyes shut up no i haven t i said feeling a bit guilty i ve been waiting for the right time no time like the present draco said leaning back on his chair and looking at me expectantly i took a deep breathe blaise wasntas volatile as draco could be but he had the kind of quiet anger that scared me to death blaise i said gently he looked up i touched the spot on his cheek where the ink was trying to rub it off you have ink on your face he grinned thanks mother hen he attempted to go back to his work blaise i uh have to tell you something i said wringing my hands blaise looked up yeah lex i well i dontreally know how to say this or how you re going to react i started you re going to blow your top off zabini draco cut in thank you draco i said giving him a withering glare now blaise dontget upset but i m uhm involved with someone i finished and i felt myself flush blaise looked slightly more interested involved involved with someone who i dislike obviously since i apparently going to blow my top off blaise looked thoughtful who he asked sharply well okay but before i tell you you have to promise i began but blaise cut me off i not promising anything lexi now tell me he said sternly i looked down then i looked back up i wasntgoing to be a coward and i wasntgoing to be ashamed of the fact that i was dating george i was tired of people trying to make me feel bad about my feelings i looked blaise in the eye and said evenly george weasley as i look back on that moment i think that blaise may have actually had a miniature heart attack he made this funny choking noise and his eye twitched he also had a violent arm spasm if i hadntbeen so afraid of being killed i would have laughed that is blaise trailed off disgusting revolting yes i thought so too but you know how our lexi is i resigned now and look at the whole thing with tolerant distaste draco piped in shut up draco i snarled blaise i said much more gently do you have any idea and damn idea of how wrong this is blaise hissed at me not only is it just wrong in a compatibility based sense but you re completely degrading yourself you family your house and the people who associate with you he said coldly i felt like i had been slapped this had been much worse much more frightening and heart wrenching than any amount of yelling draco could have done blaise dontbe like this i said reaching out to him he pulled away abruptly hitting my arm away donttouch me he said looking away i wanted to scream wanted to do anything just something that would make him understand how unfair he was being how much i needed him to be behind me on this that isntfair you like cho and she in a different house i though you of all people would understand i trailed off i can handle myself lexi you can t blaise interrupted besides a ravenclaw and a slytherin strange but bearable a slytherin and a gryffindor that just fucking selfish he spat selfish what the hell i asked furiously trying to regain my composure because you re risking so much it would cause chaos lexi dontyou get that people are in different houses for a reason you dating a gryffindor our worlds would be thrown together we re separated because we re different he said coldly blaise dontyou ever get tired of it i pleaded not really it keeps order we do our thing they do theirs and you re risking all that and for what a fling with the first male that looks at you appreciatively he snapped i felt the color drain from my face draco looked stunned even blaise looked a bit surprised lexi i that was a bit he trailed off i blinked i cantbelieve you said that i whispered i didntmean he started yes you did you meant it all it funny you say how much different you are from the gryffindorks but that sounded a lot like something i would expect to hear from them blaise looked at the ground you cantreally i just lost my i was so disappointed blaise was the one person whose supported i had wholly expected i knew he wouldntbe thrilled but i never thought he would strike out like this i was disappointed but above all i was mad he was being completely hypocritical leave me alone i hissed coldly glaring at him he looked at me shocked draco stood up blaise i think you should uh go he jerked his head towards the library door blaise stood there i rolled my eyes and started gathering my things fine i ll leave i said icily if blaise made any motion to stop me i didntnotice as i walked out i hurried out of the library and headed for the common room my head reeling momentarily wondering where draco was but then realizing i didntreally care he started this he could go to hell along with blaise why was i giving up so much for george the question popped into my head before i had time to stop it did i actually care for him or was this just a way of rebelling against how i was raised was i seeking to do the right thing in defending him so much or was i only seeking attention i hurried down the hall not knowing where i was going bumping into people not bothering to acknowledge them until the zipper on my bag caught on someone bag and tore it i turned angrily god cantyou watch where you re going i snapped nastily whipping my head around i wasntin a great mood and i was prepared to take my anger out on whatever poor sap had decided to run into me excuse me you ran into me someone snapped someone being the only person in the whole school who would dare talk to me in such a way screw off granger i not in the mood i glared viciously at her ohh did someone hurt wittle lexi feelings she cooed sarcastically granger dontpush me you do not want to start right now i said warningly granger stared at me for a moment lost in thought then she said come with me she has got to be kidding i not stupid does she really think i that dumb hah fat chance why should i i said completely aware of how childish this response was just come on she dug her nails into my arm and started dragging me i flinched and pulled out of her grasp donttouch me i said my voice filled with venom realizing i was using words that blaise had said to me moments ago i ll go but i wontbe pulled along like a mindless child i said a bit haughtily whatever she muttered leading the way into a classroom i walked in behind her and she shut the door sit she said i ll stand i d rather i responded coolly i want to know she paused what exactly if anything is going on with you and george she glared at me argh honestly why today why why why i donthave time for this i muttered going to leave granger sprang to the door and blocked my path no i want to know conrad now she said quivering none of your business granger out of my way i said glaring evenly back at her every bit of tension and hate we had ever had for each other filled the room i not stupid i can see it she scoffed you re a bitch you know that stay away from him he too good for you donttell me what to do i said trying to stay calm killing granger wouldntexactly win me admiration from george no stay away from him conrad i dontknow who you think you re kidding he out of your league granger spat i dontknow what he think either but i was done i was so tired i dontknow i just snapped no granger i won t i ll do whatever the hell i want you donthave any control over george life and certainly none over mine i paused grinning you know what i am interested in george and he likes me back i dating him granger we ve kissed and he cares about me and heck i even care about him we re going out mione and there isnt one thing you can do about it i finished triumphantly you little who she started and i dontcare what you say or what anyone else says it my choice and since you mean less than nothing to me i dontcare what you think i said sidestepping her heading for the door i felt a gust of air rush next to my ear and turned around she had her wand out merlin i was having a bad day granger donteven try it i scoffed next time i wontmiss she snapped this wasntabout just george and i anymore it was deeper than that this was just granger and i and the fact that she was going to try and hurt me in a way she had obviously wanted to do for a while what is your problem jealous i teased knowing it wasntthe most intelligent thing to do but there was no way i was going to lose to my worst enemy hardly you wontlast she scoffed george is my friend and you re going to ruin him if you really cared like you say you do you d leave him now she was looking for a reason to fight me and george was her answer dontuse george and i as an excuse to fight me granger i said grasping my wand why not she asked smirking because i dontknow about you but i personally dontneed an excuse to want to kick your ass i said grinning conjunctivitis densaugo expelliarmus furnunculus stupefy protego this and many more spells shot around the room suddenly draco burst into the room looking angry granger get the fuck away from her draco stormed in he pointed his wand at granger go i looked at granger her teeth were enlarged again and she had boils on her left arm she also had a large bruise on her cheek i looked down at myself my robes had been singed and the skin around my wrist was blistered i felt the side of my face and was surprised to feel blood granger glared at me and walked out draco held out his hand you okay yeah fine i said taking his hand i stood up and winced my leg was sprained guessing from when i dodged one of granger spells let get you to the hospital wing he said letting me lean on him i protested but when i stumbled a short cry escaped my lips that settled it we walked off to the wing me with one not so small question on my mind was george really worth all of this ahhh done i hope you guys like it next update should be soon 3 day weekend next week d 1okay i am sorry summer is here updates will be frequent i promise i just have had a lot of trouble in algebra two and my mom wasntpleased but thanks for the reviews on the last chapter they re what made me decide to continue this thankssss conngirl9 awe thanks glad you like it i dontactually hate hermione i quite fond of her however for this story i need to have her disliked for once hahaha fairyprincess21 thanks and no there is definitely nottttt any fred hermione at least that not what in the cards now adrilily i glad you checked your email thanks and yes i absolutely loved wicked onward chapter 10 hospital wings hogsmeade and office chats i would really rather not be here i said shortly i would really rather you not get into fights draco replied look who talking i hissed ugh men draco has gotten into well countless fights and i never lecture him now he treating me like a baby and i well i would have won i can handle myself draco said and looked down at me a faint smile on his face he knew he was making me angry i can handle myself draco stop treating me like a child i stomped my foot instantly wincing in pain okay not my brightest moment nor was it my most mature moment either what happened miss conrad madame pomfrey came clucking in i rolled my eyes i uh slipped i said sarcastically she eyed me suspiciously but got a potion out of her cabinet here you go drink up i drank the potion and nearly choked oh god that was bloody awful i said wiping my eyes was that really needed yes pomfrey looked quite offended at my questioning her methods now if you ll just stay the night then i can look over you you leg had quite a break in it and oh no i fine i jumped up and winced again damn bed now pomfrey commanded and draco nodded traitor draco how can you do this just leave me here to rot in this disgustingly sterile room of white i cried sorry lex draco said get better pomfrey shooed him out of the hospital wing and told me to get some rest i looked around the room granger obviously wasnthere thank god because honestly i probably would have torn her to shreds really i mean it i sighed and leaned back against my pillow the bed was really a lot more comfortable than i expected wow three minutes and i already bored out of my mind i said this is going to be one thrilling night well in all actuality it had already been a thrilling night i fought granger and held my ground with only mild interference by draco might i add although i d rather not be in this horribly clean hospital wing things hadntactually turned out too horribly i looked around the hospital wing again i was the only patient currently i sighed again i had to admit i felt a bit ashamed that i had to be here when granger didntseem to need medical attention well of course not she the smartest witch in our year i sure she knows all sorts of dorky healing spells i said to myself still i felt as though somehow this made me the loser and well george wouldntbe too pleased george i had completely forgot the reason for my fight with granger now not only did i feel that granger outdid me but she also knew about george and i argh this day couldntget any worse i moaned burying my head in my pillow i continued mumbling small curses and whinings into my pillow for about 10 minutes i felt a small tap on my shoulder i whipped my head around hey listen leave me the fu i stopped draco grinned at me you re extremely childish conrad he said sitting down on my bed i smiled thanks for leaving me with the crazy lady i gave him a pointed look took you long enough to get your arse back here sorry blaise held me up i looked down blaise another item on my ever growing list of problems really and uh what did blaise want i asked trying to sound nonchalant just wanted to know if i really supported your relations with weasley draco responded he paused are you okay no i was not i hadntfelt this un okay in a long time one of my best friends was mad at me my boyfriend friends hated me i hated them my parents would murder me if they found out about george no i said in a small voice i not okay draco put his hand on my shoulder dontlet blaise get you down lexi he surprised i was too he ll get over it i shrugged doesntmatter to me if he does or not i donthave to answer to anybody but myself and if he cantbe happy for me then he can just leave me alone or he could just stop being a prat but i knew he wouldn t blaise was stubborn as hell especially when he thought he was right about something hell even when he knows he wrong he still holds out forever you do care and it does matter to you draco said quietly i dont want it to matter to me i dontwant to have to sneak around like this and i dontwant my friends to hate me because i want to be happy this isnt fair draco i not doing anything wrong am i i asked desperately draco looked at me pity evident in his eyes draco malfoy never pitied anyone no lex you re just doing something different he said giving me a hug thanks i whispered sometimes i was glad draco didntsupport me like normal friends did he didntcoddle me and that made the moments where he showed real affection towards me all the more special no problem alexis he grinned now i d best go before the old bat comes back in here get better soon okay draco ruffled my hair and left as swiftly as he had come i grinned and rolled over draco always had the innate ability to cheer me up perhaps he didntalways use the most traditional methods but then again we didnthave the most traditional friendship i think i had dozed off for about 40 minutes when i heard rustling somewhere to the left of me i quietly opened one eye and tried not to move lexi hey you you up i felt a sharp jab in my side i rolled over trying to ignore my assailant they were persistent as i felt another round of poking lexi come on i just want to talk to you you know you want to talk to me right the cocky voice asked i sat up and glared at him argh no i cranky i ve had a bad day my leg hurts i do not want to speak to you i snapped and flopped down onto my bed a minute passed what do you want fred i asked exasperated i felt my bed shift as he sat down are you okay he asked i shifted myself up and looked at him he actually looked concerned yes i am okay i a big girl i can handle myself i rolled my eyes well you never know hermione is pretty skilled i glared at him not saying you aren t but come on she a bloody genius yes well now that you ve pointed out grangers obvious superiority to me would you mind letting me get back to bed i snapped again fred look taken aback i felt a pang of shame here he was coming to check up on me and i was being a royal bitch to him look i sorry i ve just had a really bad day and seeing as how you re about the only person who actually seems to care i naturally taking it out on you i shook my head and i know that not exactly a good excuse but its all i ve got fred smiled kindly at me that okay george is going to be right pissed when he hears that hermione basically jumped you he paused i dontunderstand why she did it though she hates me fred and i hate her you dontexactly need a reason to want to attack someone you hate and she been looking for a reason i laughed yeah i egged her on a bit i ll admit it but honestly who wouldn t fred laughed i would i grinned while i was beginning to care for george more and more fred was becoming more like a brother to me i didnttrust him as much as draco but i did talk to him more than most people so you want to tell uncle freddy what happened fred asked well not asked demanded nicely because although he asked i knew he meant that i was going to tell him so i did and then draco comes in and tells her to get out so she gets up and limps her smart aleck stupid fat ass out of the room i finished heatedly i cantstand her really it just so annoying none of her business at all fred chuckled you ll come to find that hermione gets into a lot of things that arenther business but she does care about people yeah well i d rather like it if she stayed out of my business i crossed my arms over my chest fred looked at the clock well i going to get going george said he would be back early this morning and i sure he going to get an earful from everyone he grinned i sighed everything had to be so complicated hey now dontfeel guilty from what george tells me your worth all the hassle any of his family or friends could give him fred squeezed my shoulder as he stood up now i must away he tipped an imaginary hat from his head i giggled thanks fred and i meant it no problem lexi he said opening the door noiselessly and leaving the room i sighed and got more comfortable on the bed what a day and i had a feeling this was just the beginning now that granger knew about george and i i knew she wouldntexactly let things go between us well if she wanted a fight i would give her one i would be a lot more prepared than i was today too i would show her what happened when you messed with lexi conrad i rolled over and closed me eyes drifting off into a restless sleep i woke up early the next morning eager to get back to civilization i okay right just like i knew i d be i said a bit haughtily i ll admit but i needed to get out of there yes miss conrad you re fine still better safe than sorry madame pomfrey clucked shooing me out of the hospital wing how rude like i was forcing her to let me stay there i stumbled out into an empty hallway it was still pretty early but i knew breakfast would be going on so i headed towards the great hall i walked in a bit surprised at how empty it was there were a few studious ravenclaws in there as well as some gryffindors and hufflepuffs i grinned at the head table where i saw fred and george discussing something i headed to my table and stopped blaise his head was down so i assumed he hadntnoticed me i walked slowly over to the table it felt like it took me forever to cross the hall i approached where blaise was sitting and stopped he noticed me of course i saw his eyes quickly flicker up he didntacknowledge me in any way though i narrowed my eyes if blaise wanted to have a fight i would give him one i turned on my heel and walked to the other end of the table my head held high i sat down looking straight forward i heard a scoff from the far end of the table i glanced around the hall again george and fred were looking at me both with concern though george seemed more worried i looked down i didntwant to discuss last night not yet i quickly finished breakfast and hurried out of the hall blaise stood up as i passed we both paused and looked at each other i swear in that moment things were okay even though we were both mad at each other and we knew we would continue to be angry for a while for just a second everything was back to normal i wanted to hang onto that moment forever blaise friendship and good opinion meant so much to me in only a span of 3 minutes i had lost both blaise quickly shook his head like he was waking himself up maybe he was i heard myself take a sharp intake of breathe and turn around walking quickly out of the great hall more specifically walking away from my former best friend a lot of people like the weekend i only like saturday for me sunday is always so anxious because you know a week of work is about to start i can never relax not only that but my saturday had been ruined by blaise and granger i stopped my thoughts now that blaise and i were fighting what should i refer to him as zabini the thought of being so coldly formal to blaise almost hurt but there was no way i was going to forgive him so easily especially when he wouldnteven admit he was wrong i sighed and went into the common room draco was exiting the boys dorms as i came in ah there our resident hospital patient he said grinning at me i glared ergh dontget me started i chuckled i already ate i ll probably be ready by the time you re done wait in the hall for me i asked yeah okay draco nodded not too long though right i hurried to my dorm to get ready after cleaning myself up i decided to wear a skirt for once i put on a black skirt that came to a bit above the knees with it i paired a grey 3 4 sleeved shirt that had a white collar and cuffs on the sleeves i put a thick black headband in my hair and wore black mary janes all in all i looked very professional i grinned neat i rushed up to the entrance hall i stopped and smoothed out my skirt before making my big entrance i walked haughtily past the gryffindors retuning their glares with ease my eye caught grangers and i was please to see the bruise on her cheek was still in tact i smirked at her and turned away making sure my hair flipped i tried not to grin too triumphantly as i walked over to draco let go i said about time he stood up and we left the hall how awful was the wing lex draco asked like i said dontget me started i paused fred visited me really draco rolled his eyes gosh they re all just accepting you as a surrogate member of the weasel clan arentthey he drawled no weasel hates me only gingersnap fred and george like me i grinned and really who can blame them draco shook his head but smiled so anything uhm interesting happen at breakfast i asked if you re wondering if blaise said anything about you the answer is no draco said actually i had gone so far as to think you two might have made up but obviously that isntthe case yeah uhm we kind of avoided each other at breakfast i paused he can come up to me when he ready to apologize and admit he acted like a prat draco laughed you two are the most stubborn people i know i shrugged yeah anyway what do you want to do today draco grinned actually i was thinking of a little sneak trip into hogsmeade for my best friend and i i squealed in delight and do what exactly draco paused i suppose we could go and get our outfits for the my parent new years party i pounced on him yes let s every year the malfoys hosted a very lavish extravagant new years party it was a very formal affair and only the most prominent wizarding families along with the minister of magic and other high ranking officials attended and if you didntwear the best you were considered a target for cheap gossip from catty old ladies for the rest of the night and possibly weeks after that so you made sure you wore the best so let me go and get the money my mother sent me and then we ll ne on our way i said excitedly i may have been more down to earth than many females at hogwarts but i was still a girl and like any normal girl i loved to shop oooh look at this one i said pulling draco over to a another rack of robes ugh these are a nice color but not very well made look at the loose stitching i slumped my shoulders and put the aqua robes back on the rack draco paused i think navy would be a good color for you it would contrast against your skin and make your eyes stand out draco although he was a guy had undoubtedly good taste because he didntgo for things that were trendy like most did he wore things that were sleek and sophisticated and always in style well obviously you re going to get silver or green you always do i said simply he shrugged why fix something that isntbroken because change is good i said pulling out deep red robes naaah yeah you re a bit too pale draco offered thanks you re a walking confidence booster you are i said sarcastically then i saw it the most beautifully elegant set of robes i had ever laid my eyes on they were perfect just perfect draco i trailed off and walked over to the robes handling them delicately it was as though i feared something so perfect looking might shatter if treated too roughly perfect draco came up behind me my best friend will be the best looking witch at the whole party i grinned oh you know it then we set out to pick out draco robes although he usually settled for the standard emerald green or silver i wanted to persuade my friend to think eh outside his little color spectrum i gasped draco made an approving noise in the back of his throat we both headed for the rack i turned fabulous arentthey drakey i looked around draco was at a rack about 10 feet away inspecting some silver robes oh no mister these are the robes for you i brandished the robes at him with a flourish he took them eyeing them thoughtfully good fabric i added yeah these will do a little change of color wontkill me i guess draco agreed i grinned as we paid for our items this was fun draco thanks for suggesting it i gave him a sideways smile no problem lexi draco grinned at least we ve got this out of the way how responsible of us i shrugged even though we snuck out to do so i suppose it could be perceived that way draco then informed me that i was ruining the moment and told me to shut up arse it was about 3 o clock when we got back to the school draco then informed me that he had a meeting with persons whose names he wouldntdisclose to me this led me to believe that he was involved in something rather shady and had blaise and i been on speaking terms i wold have concocted some sort of plan to find out what so i decided now would be a nice time to talk to george if he wasntbusy i went straight to his office and paused what if he was busy i shook my head he would definitely want to talk to me right i knocked on his door and took a step back i heard the sound of someone hurrying over to the door a lock turning and the door knob being turned george grinned as he opened the door wider to admit me into the room hey lexi i smiled hi he shut the door and gave me a hug which i returned how are you i asked sitting down in his spinney chair behind his desk i spun myself around for a few seconds as he answered i been doing fine but i think the more important question is how are you he stopped the chair with his arms and lifted me up i ve heard you had a not so great night yeah it wasntthe best of days i replied george sat down on the couch a n oh so strategically placed by yours truly d do you want to tell me about it of course i wanted to tell him about it i wanted to tell him about it and have him hug me and tell me everything would be okay i wanted comfort okay i said quietly and sat down nest to him snuggling into him george put his arm around me and pulled me close and i felt safe well what do you want to hear about i asked everything tell me about hermione first george said okay well i was heading back from the library on my way to the common room right and i wasntin the best of moods and i bumped into someone granger so before i even knew it was her i was already mad and told her to watch where she was going then she said something bitchy back to me i felt george chest rumble with silent laughter and i turned to leave but then she said she wanted to talk to me about something well i protested because i thought she was going to like hex me or something anyway eventually i went with her i paused and looked up george looked angry so we went into this deserted classroom and all of a sudden she starts talking about how she knows something going on between us not only that but she kept telling me about how she knew i just wanted to hurt you and that if i really cared about you i would just stop being with you i took a deep breathe and george asked and i got mad at her because i didntlike her saying those thing about me about us i swallowed and so i goaded her a bit saying things like that i did care about you and i could date you if i wanted then she pulled out her wand and well i dontlike to back down from a challenge i looked down i knew that what had happened was partially my fault but that didntmake me any less sorry i did feel bad though because now it felt as though george would have to choose between one of his friends and me i know george finally said and well i sorry why i asked looking at him i sorry you had to go through that i should have known hermione would have been intuitive enough to spot our relationship and i should have told her from the beginning you ve told malfoy and zabini and i should be able to tell my friends too george said it is your fault grangers got it out for me george snorted she does its not that simple sure you guys dontget along but this wouldnthave happened if i would have been honest with them george looked down at me and my lexi got hurt because of it i smiled his lexi i liked how that sounded coming from him it was a term i could definitely get used to you know i care about you right lexi george asked seriously turning me to face him his eyes were the most amazing shade of blue i was so close to his face that i could even see the little circular patterns in the iris they were stunning i looked like a pool of water that was being rained on you know with all the little raindrops making rivets in his eyes they were magnificent i nodded i know i care about you too i was really upset when i heard hermione sought you out like that upset with her and myself i going to try and keep her out of your hair okay george smiled at me i almost sighed at the sight of his smile i beamed at him okay but i can handle things you know like if she bothers me i can deal with her i leaned my forehead against his thanks though he smiled so what had you looking so depressed at breakfast today i sighed blaise he being a right prat about i trailed off about george prompted us i whispered oh george sounded perplexed to say the least he concerned and i appreciate it but he doesntseem to care about whether i happy or not i know that it well a bit of a surprise but i know he just being stubborn i shook my head he so thick are you happy george asked a flash of concern crossing his eyes of course i said hugging him i m happier with you than i ve been in a while i really was as hard as it was for me to admit it george grinned i glad because a fantastic girl like you deserves to be happy i smiled kissing george lightly on the lips he certainly was charming and i trusted him even though it went against my better judgment i felt george would never hurt me at least never intentionally he deepened the kiss and i felt myself lean back against the arm of the couch george quickly following my hands found his hair and his found my waist i was falling and falling fast and the weird thing was i didntexactly want to stop myself so i think this was kind of a filler chapter well half filler half george reaction but i hate having short chapters reviews are greatly appreciated and i promise promise that i will update soon like soon

cute shortening of it hahaha yeah i trying to update as fast as i can i having some serious writers block i really just have to get to christmas then the story should flow out i have everything after that worked out and i like it a lot d and i definitely plan on something biggg happening to draco concerning all that death eater stuff anywayyyyy onward chapter 11 hogsmeade and halloween dates so its been a few weeks since the incident as cho calls it i still haventmade up with blaise i haventreally come into contact with granger i think we re both waiting for the other to make the first move the whole school can sense this great tension between the houses since each house has stood behind their member respectively everyone can sense that soon something going to happen someone going to blow we just dontknow when and for now i just trying to enjoy this break in the constant bickering granger and i had going on i also trying to push what i see as an inevitable occurrence out of my mind in recent weeks i finally divulged my secret to pansy she wasntrepulsed in the least and said she d bang him if she had the chance that a direct quote however to ensure her secrecy i not only had to place a hex on her taking a page out of granger book but i promised i would throw a good word in with draco about her which i have yet to do i sighed and leaned back in my chair attempting to listen to what mcgonagall was saying draco looked at me i smiled he smiled back i glanced over to where the golden trio had settled down granger was listening with rapt attention potter was trying and weasley currently had drool running down his cheek which was rather disgusting i poked draco and pointed to weasley gross i mouthed draco smirked and raised his hand i grinned yes mr malfoy professor mcgonagall said sharply are you not understanding something oh i understand everything alright so far professor it just i having a hard time paying attention with weasley over there drooling away it quite revolting draco said wrinkling his nose slightly giggles broke out in the classroom and mcgonagall quickly silenced the room thank you for your concern mr malfoy she said staring at him shrewdly she rounded on weasley weasley mhmph his head jerked up he looked around and quickly and wiped the area surrounding his mouth ewww i said turning my head away where your bib at weasel okay now maybe i shouldnthave said it but my insulting gene kicked in it a habit what can i say giggles broke out throughout the class thank you for your input miss conrad mcgonagall said sternly i smiled sweetly at her granger glared at me and i smiled even wider mcgonagall cleared her throat as i was saying she continued her lesson i sighed and looked at draco he was actually paying attention i had noticed a subtle change arising in draco over the past few weeks not only was he actually paying attention in classes but he had begun to well interact more with other houses to be sure it was mostly making fun of them but there were times when he held almost civil conversations with people i didntknow what to make of it the next thing i knew class was ending and draco was tapping me on the shoulder eh i said shaking my head draco smirked let go conrad he pulled me up oh yeah okay i grinned we walked out of the transfiguration classroom and there was the golden trio malfoy you re such a bloody wanker wealsey said angrily oh geesh i said turning away stop being so sensitive ronniekins granger glared at me what i said to her here it goes you re so immature lexi she started but i cut her off ha granger i dontcare leave me alone i hate you so much you donteven understand i just hate the thought that we both exist in the same time frame or whatever i shook my head you re such a prude prude granger sputtered yes granger a prude a tight laced busybody thinks she knows everything prude i paused considering the fact that everybody thinks that about you you should be used to hearing it granger shook in her place i didntreally understand why she was getting so mad i was saying anything terribly rude to her i donthave to listen to this she turned and stormed off bye i called after her in a falsely sweet voice weasel just gaped at me for a moment and followed her potter shrugged and followed but not before shooting a cool look towards draco let go lexi draco said i turned and followed him down to our dorms why do you think she so upset i asked who cares it granger lexi you know the girl who just bloody attacked you draco rounded on me i know i wasntasking because i cared it just it more fun to get a rise out of her when i actually saying something really mean i said slowly glaring at draco true he agreed she was abnormally easy to goad today we dropped our stuff off in the dorms draco and i were supposed to go out to the lake and hang out but he suddenly said he couldn t and that he had things to do again i assumed draco was getting himself involved in something a little on the bad side but if anyone could get himself out of a bad situation it was draco so for now i decided to honor his wishes and not press him for information so that left me by myself i had thought of finding cho but that idea was quickly forgotten as i saw her talking to blaise she waved at me though and i waved back and quickly walked away so i went to the library by myself as i was walking there i saw a crowd of students standing in front of a notice in the great hall i went over and shoved my way through scanned the notice quickly and walked away a hogsmeade visit on halloween that should be fun i went into the library which was pretty empty today unusual considering it was a school day i went to the back wanting to be left alone and got a book on advanced transfiguration actually although i would never admit to it i did really enjoy that subject if only if werentthe head of gryffindor that taught it i started flipping through the pages reading about human transfiguration i pulled a quill and some ink out of my bag to make some notes about what i was reading since madame pince had forbidden me from taking books from the library after an incident in 4th year involving one of my books and draco ink well not pretty to say the least so there i was writing down the thinking process one should go through before attempting human transfiguration alone in the library suddenly i saw a bag plop down on the table in front of me i looked up harry bloody potter i stared at him for a moment then i blinked and went back to my reading we need to have a chat lexi he said pulling out the chair next to me and sitting down conrad i said continuing my reading what he asked i looked at him conrad i repeated my friends call me lexi you call me conrad that how it always been i shook my head and went back to my book things change lexi potter said taking my book from me i glared at him what what could you possibly want i asked i just want to talk you seem pretty nice potter said leaning back on his chair i blinked i seem nice i lexi conrad a slytherin seem nice to a goody goody gryffindor not just any gryffindor but the king goody goody himself happy bloody potter oh no i stood up i dontthink so blaise was right this was turning me into some surrogate member of the gryffindor house i like george not any of you i have no inclination to get to know any of you i am a slytherin you are a gryffindor we are not meant to be able to coexist peacefully i said you and george seem able to pull it off potter said grinning at me i glared once again his cocky smirk reminded so much of draco it was almost hard to distinguish between them at first we re the exception not the rule i walked away bye lexi potter hollered to me i turned around and glared at him then promptly ran into blaise i looked at him my mouth open uhm i trailed off his face of course was unreadable i had thought he had looked pleased to see me but now i wasnttoo sure close your mouth he said coolly and brushed by me i looked at his retreating back and closed my mouth damn so how classes george asked sitting in his chair and spinning around i shrugged okay i just glad there arenthuge exams at the end of the year i said too true he laughed then again i never really worried when there were his grin lit up his face i laughed well you were too busy pranking everyone true on that too he came over and sat next to me putting his arm around me so i assuming as a normal hogwarts student you ve heard about the hogsmeade trip he asked mhmm i said as casually as possible i really wanted him to ask me then again i wouldntblame him if he suggested that we go out another time what do you want to do george asked me i dontknow uhm what do you mean i responded not sure what he was asking do you uh wanna go with me he grinned lopsidedly at me i giggled sure but you know draco and pansy will probably force me to spend some time with them i said well you know we could always stay late since i a teacher you wouldntget in trouble anyway even if you could get in trouble you wouldn t i smiled that because troublemaker george weasley knows how to get around the school unnoticed he smiled back you know it hm well how about i go off with draco and pansy for a while then we can stay late i suggested it wasntthat i didntwant to be seen with george it was just i didntwant certain people to see me with george that sounds good his faltered so uhm have you and blaise no i said i ran into him today but he just walked away i finished sadly i dontcare i dont care i dontcare but it fine he can come to me when he ready to apologize i said indifferently maybe you should talk to him i sure he misses you too george offered trying to be helpful i smiled but shook my head doubt it even if he does miss me he too damn stubborn to show it kind of like someone else i know george said innocently biting back a smile excuse me what is that supposed to mean i looked at him shocked i couldnthelp but grin oh nothing forget i even said anything george said looking at the ceiling georgeeeee i whined i am not stubborn i not did i say that he asked looking at me in shock i grinned god i would never let anyone else tease me like this except maybe draco i do believe you did i looked at him smirking we had both somehow ended up standing and were inches apart my head tilted up so that i could see him he was taller than me to be sure there werentmany people who weren t but he wasnttoo much taller than me he was well perfect nahhh he said smiling down at me his smile was so cute it wasntmean or malicious or sarcastic like i was used to seeing from most people suddenly i felt a jolt stop it i shrieked in delight george continued tickling me i laughed and he continued mercilessly i had never been tickled before in my life so i wasntused to the sensation and i was very sensitive to it please george stop i laughed i going to die i swear he stopped for a moment i take it your rather ticklish then he asked smirking at me what would give you that idea i asked trying to keep a straight face this and it began again holding one arm around me so i couldntescape he somehow was still able to tickle me with one hand george no i laughed but i didnt really want him to stop and he knew it i looked across the common room at blaise he looked so serious his head was slightly bent over his piece of parchment i could see his quill gliding across the surface at an almost rhythmic pace everyone once in a while he would looks up at the essay he was copying to make sure he was getting the right information i laughed softly to myself blaise was brilliant but he hardly ever did his homework he suddenly stiffened as if he sensed someone looking at him i quickly looked back at my book my face showing no emotion a few seconds later i could feel his eyes on me but i couldntbring myself to look at him i wanted him to apologize not through looks but with words i guess george was right i really am stubborn after all i awoke early on halloween i was nervous and excited i had a date with george george my boyfriend i mentally slapped myself i was behaving like such a child but my girly side reasoned every girl has the right to be excited over her boyfriend i grinned then bit my lower lip what was i going to wear i sighed then turned to pansy still occupied bed she did have more experience than me when it came to dressing to impress but then again she dressed more like a strumpet than a respectable yet cute girl which was what i was going for i turned away no i would figure this out alone i opened my wardrobe and started going through all my shirts hmm it was october too chilly for a skirt so i decided to wear jeans therefore in order to look pretty i had to wear a really spectacular shirt since i mostly owned emerald green things i decided to wear a different color today i picked out a periwinkle scoop neck sweater it was very comfortable but not prudish i put on boots just in case it was muddy from the rain the other day i looked in the mirror my jeans were darker and contrasted nicely with the pastel color of the periwinkle i didntknow how to do my hair so i pulled some of it up in a half ponytail letting some stray hairs fall in the front i didntput much makeup on just some mascara blush and lipgloss i smiled confidently in the mirror and walked out the door i went down into the common room of course just my luck there was blaise he looked up at me and smirked date with weasel he said coolly this was as close as i was going to get to a normal conversation with blaise i was unsure of whether he was asking out of genuine curiosity or just to be a jackass i suspected a little of both i shrugged noncommittally date with cho he snorted she your friend too why should i be ashamed why should i be ashamed then only because you re a hypocrite i paused you really know how to show appreciation and what are you talking about he asked standing up only the fact that if it werentfor me wanting you to be happy you probably wouldntbe with cho in the first place and now when i happy you cantbe a good friend and be happy for me i stated calmly there a difference he started angrily there no difference in the way you and i feel about them blaise i hissed blaise shook his head you re never going to understand i rolled my eyes understand what why you cantbe happy for me why you re allowed to have a relationship but not me i was getting upset i had to remind myself to stay under control no lexi understand that people like him are nothing but trouble he isntrespectable at all do you really think you can have a lasting relationship with someone like him blaise asked he was subtly clenching and unclenching his fists in order to stay clam i dontknow but i do know i care about him and he makes me happy isntthat what matters i asked sometimes happiness isntenough blaise said his eyes hardening think of who you are lexi the person you re supposed to be the way your supposed to act i knew who i was alexis conrad daughter of a very respectable family pureblooded and proud of it i knew who i was supposed to be respectable polite to the right people standing up for my family beliefs i was supposed to be perfect a social delight my mother told me once not caring about anybody and probably marrying for money and power not love that was who i was i didntlike that person very much i didntparticularly want to be that person either i can see you wontbe changing your mind on this i said coldly so i ll just end this conversation and save us both time i walked away briskly it was hard i didntlook back blaise knew what i felt now if he had something to say he could come find me i thought more and more about what he said on my way down to the great hall there were a fair amount of people i sat down nest to a slytherin 2nd year and silently began to poke at some bacon and eggs i knew blaise was wrong he just had to be he was wrong i would prove it happiness would be enough so when are you meeting weasel draco asked i gave him a look weasley then he corrected quarter till 3 at the shrieking shack i said george hadnttold me where he was taking me or what we were doing which i guess was part of the reason i was so excited usually i didntlike surprises they didntgenerally bode well for anything but for some reason i knew that george surprises were the kind to get excited about anyway where do you guys wanna go i asked we decided to do our usual round of honeydukes zonko s and the three broomsticks then we decided to go clothes shopping since i needed a new muggle winter jacket and we set off we walked to the carriages me then draco then pansy i avoided the thestrals as i always did their eyes had always scared me ever since first year i shook my head and climbed into the carriage we arrived in hogsmeade and got out most students were heading to honeydukes so we decided to head to zonko first then just walk around till the rush died down draco and i stocked up on funny joke ideas planning on pranking granger while pansy flirted with a cute assistant which is okay because when we made our purchases he gave us his employee discount that was helpful i said as we left we wandered around hogsmeade till about 1 30 just talking and making fun of people we decided to go to the three broomsticks to get a butterbeer and warm up so how quidditch this year drakey i asked stirring my butterbeer it was an odd habit i had but i always had to get a straw and stir my butterbeer while i wasntdrinking it then to drink it i would take the straw out really good the team has really been progressing nicely i think that if the keeper can just be a little more attentive to the left goal post we ll be good he explained so you think we have a good chance at the cup this year i asked excitedly i think gryffindor still poses a pretty big threat though draco admitted potter just always seems to see the snitch before me he said shaking his head dontworry draco you re great anyway potter well he just slippery pansy supplied helpfully i nodded he d have to be wouldnthe to get out of trouble as many times as he has i added poor draco it really wasnthis fault potter seemed to have gold detectors in his fingers yeah i mean how am i supposed to compete with bloody harry perfect potter draco asked leaning forward and putting his head in his hands dontworry about competing with him its a game besides potters gotta be off his mark this year what with i stopped and lowered my voice his precious godfather dying pansy nodded she got a point you know draco smiled true so lets not worry about it i said regretting bringing up the subject taking another sip of my butterbeer i listened as pansy attempted to compliment draco on his shirt ohhhhh drakeykins that shirt is so good on you it shows off all you muscles she cooed i concealed a snort and grinned at draco who scowled at me in return i looked at my watch and saw that it was a quarter after two guys how about we head to honeydukes now i said casually draco grinned at me oh yeah almost time for our little lexi da a a aa te he drawled pansy squealed you have 45 minutes so we ll go to honeydukes quickly and then i ll take you back here so you can freshen up she said glowing my little lexi finally has a boyfriend thank you mother hen pansy shut up i growled i could feel my face flushing i stood up now i can either wealk around myself or you two dorks can come with me which will it be i swept out of the three broomsticks without another word i waited outside for draco and pansy no need to be dramatic lexi draco smirked at me yeah lexi chill out pansy whined oh be quiet both of you i rolled my eyes you re the drama queen of hogwarts draco you donthave much room to talk i paused and pansy you re a close second they laughed and so did i we went into honeydukes where i only bought some chocolate frogs and fizzing whizbees before announcing that i was going to be leaving soon pansy quickly said let get you to a bathroom come on and i found myself being dragged toward the nearest public restroom okay now just freshen up reapply makeup comb hair you know the drill i ll guard the door pansy said the sad thing was she was serious while i was freshening up she chased away anyone who attempted to come into the bathroom threatening them with curses or hexes mostly from draco and dontthink draco wontbe hearing about this i heard her yell as i came out of the bathroom i shook my head there happy i said she looked me over once and nodded draco walked over to us outside of the bathroom we ll walk you up so you dontmeet any unsavory characters draco said casually i smirked awe is draco concerned i couldntresist asking not really thought you could use the company he smiled i smiled but let it pass thanks pansy walked along silently so is george a good kisser i sputtered none of your business i cried indignantly you didntthink that i wouldntwant to know now did you she asked i dontcare because i not telling you anything about my relationship i said then changing my tone followed with why are you guys teasing me so much today we arrived to the small path leading up t the shrieking shack i could see it from where i stood you want us to come up draco asked no that okay thanks though i said giving him a small hug he looked me over once then he told pansy to start walking back that he would meet her weasley better appreciate you he said grinning slightly i kind of feel like a father you know like i letting you go he hugged me again i always going to be here for you draco you re my best friend i said smiling at him i know you re like my bratty little sister who i cantget to listen to reason he said shrugging but i put up with you yeah yeah yeah get a move on buster i said shooing him away have fun alexis dontdo anything i wouldn t he paused on second thought dontdo anything granger wouldntdo yeah because we all know that there isntmuch you haventdone i said sarcastically wlaking up the path i ll be fine draco it just george draco sighed it wasntgeorge he was worried about george i said he turned around oh hey he grinned at me took you long enough i laughed sorry he walked over to me and put his arms around me it okay you re here now and that all that matters i smiled into his chest george made me feel so safe loved even i felt like nothing could hurt me when i was with him so what are we doing today mr weasley i asked well my fair lady i just happen to have something very very special planned you see i thought that since you are a slytherin and therefore donthave as much fun as some other houses might that you could use a touch of gryffindor fun he said grinning at me i laughed i have plenty of my own kind of fun george ruffled my hair come on let go he took my hand in his and led me past the shrieking shack so where are we going i asked he looked back at me and grinned now it would ruin the surprise if i told you but i will tell you that we do have to apparate he shushed me as i opened my mouth in protest i know you can t but i can for both of us but dumbledore i began says its alright i asked him george paused he didntseem too surprised really kind of gave me that knowing smile i laughed well it is hogwarts and dumbledore has eyes and ears everywhere i said quoting my mother so okay i think we re far away now that we can apparate without anyone seeing us george said just grab a hold of me okay dontlet go no matter how hard the pull is i wontlet go i promised he looked at me and something passed through his eyes that i couldntquite read but it was gone as quickly as it had come i grabbed onto his arm and clutched it like my life depended on it i felt a strange sensation of being pulled through something however i didntlet go of george soon i found myself stopping suddenly i shook my head my eye focusing so where exactly are we i asked before us stood a small flat building this george said is a muggle bowling alley a n oh god i tried to think of something original xx gah what bowling alley i asked confused i really wasntacquainted with many muggle hobbies or pastimes george chuckled it just bowling the alley is where you do it you ll see he grabbed my hand and led me towards the door he opened it and i looked around the inside of the building appeared much large than the outside had on one wall a row of what appeared to be wooden lane type things sat side by side i saw people muggle presumably rolling rather heavy looking balls down these strips of wood i shook my head on the other side was a small cafe george edged me over to the counter he handed the man some money what size shoe do you wear he asked seven why suddenly the man thrust a pair of musty looking shoes at me george had also gotten his shoes he led me over to a secluded area okay when muggles bowl they wear these kinds of shoes to keep the floors new and shiny i think or maybe they just all like to match i not sure george said taking his shoes off and putting them in a locker i looked down at the shoes in my hands you mean other people have worn these i asked horrified well yes but it not that bad come on please george pouted at me i smiled okay but if i get some foot fungusy thing you re completely to blame i paused i took my shoes off and put them in the same locker george had used so i take it you ve been bowling before i asked as i put on the shoes george nodded fred and i used to come here all the time i grinned how much trouble did you cause none surprisingly he laughed we re both really good at bowling actually good i said looking at the lanes apprehensively you can teach me since i have no idea what to do george put his arm around me as we headed over to a lane sure thing sweetie i smiled so okay what you re saying is that i lug this 10 pound ball roll it down this lane and try and hit as many of those pins as possible george nodded at me that the gist of it but if the object is to knock down the pins why dontyou just use a blasting spell it would make everything so much easier i shook my head because dear muggles cantuse magic george whispered in my ear oh duh i laughed hahaha that right i forgot oops i had a feeling bowling and i werentgoing to get along i was right oh george it stuck i whined trying to fling the ball off my hand it hurts i such a sissy here let me see george slowly twisted my fingers slightly back and forth so that the bowling ball slid off there we go all better thanks i said no more major mishaps occurred that day unless you count me losing horribly to george but i didntreally mind that much i found that i was glad just to be able to spend time with him out in the open like normal people for once in my life i found solace in muggles we exited the bowling alley after trading in our shoes and grabbing a soda so what are we doing now i asked well it almost dusk and i was thinking that i would take you back to hogsmeade and uhm well you ll see george said nervously okay i said george really seemed like he wanted to go all out for our first real date it made me happy to know he cared this much we apparated back to the shrieking shack george stood next to me and just held me it felt nice with his arms around my waist and mine around his neck we just stood there for a bit enjoying each others company let go he said and started to lead me up past the shrieking shack arentwe going back to hogsmeade i asked working to hike up the rocky terrain did i say that george asked airily ah well i want to show you something first oh what it is i asked slyly he turned around and kissed me it was quite a feat but we managed to get a mini snogging session in while hiking up to wherever it was george wanted to go i canttell you he said teasingly pulling away i smiled up at him and let a breath out george weasley actually took my breath away we re almost there he said quietly about five minutes later we can to a small cliff george sat down and patted the spot next to him confused i sat down what had he wanted me to see he put his arm around me and i leaned into him it was comfortable i looked at him but he pointed ahead of us look i looked ahead as he requested and gasped we were facing a setting sun it was so beautiful from as high up as we were we were practically level with the horizon the sun looked so majestic as it went down it beautiful i love it i said looking up at him thanks this was like the moment of nay girls dreams a beautiful sunset ending a perfect day alone with the person you well i wasntexactly sure what i felt about george it was strong i cared about him but did i love him i wasntsure because i had never been sure what love was exactly of course i loved him in that i care about you kind of way but was i in love with him you re welcome i had a great time today with you lexi he said kissing the top of my head i had the best time today too george i whispered it was perfect everything i closed my eyes whatever i was feeling right now i wanted to remember it because it was the best i had ever felt in my entire life even if i didntlove george now i knew i could i knew he was someone i knew i wanted around me he cared about me and that was one thing i did love about him okay hahahaha so how was that bad i hope not i hope you guys like it it took me like a week to think of what kind of date to make them go on anyone who wants to suggest like date ideas for lexi and george are welcome to hahaha and i ll give you credit or whatever i just dontwant to use the same old date ideas even the sunset thing was something i was kind of ehhh about i love you all review please 1okay so i going to try and update one more time before i move and my computer is unplugged and all that and stuff so this might be a shorter than usual chapter actually i think i just basically going to have thanks to the reviewers pipabelle argh yes in my notebook i have 3 o clock i really have no idea why i put 2 45 i really need to start proofreading a lot more carefully ah but instead of marking it down to me being an awful proofreader let just say pansy is dumb and canttell time d arsonal pyromaniac thanks captain speed o ah thank you so much yeah i just love george haha and the whole speed thing is just i dontwant people to get bored by writing too much like unimportant detail and not sticking to the plot enough i tend to do that crea ah gosh i so jealous france sounds awesome my friend went there for a few weeks this year i actually take french although my teacher didntteach us much but still i hope you had a great time okay so some of you may absolutely hate what i do in this chapter i sorry just please read it and at the end i ll explain further why this must happen and no lexi and george dontbreak up it something else hehe oh and by the way the translation below was the closest i could get using an online translator anywayyyyy onward chapter 12 animadverto sinus i nearly skipped into the common room after george brought me back to hogwarts that day right before anyone turned around to see me though i masked my joy lexi draco nodded as i walked over to him nice time very thanks i sat down next to him what have you been up to he had a spare bit of parchment in front of him he was scribbling something down on it i tried to look at it but he yanked it out of my view nothing lexi dontworry your pretty little head about it he grinned at me it seemed a bit forced i looked at him skeptically but didntpress anything so where did he take you draco said looking around the common room bowling i said bowling what that draco asked tilting his head to one side a muggle thing that they do for fun i wasntvery good i replied picking up a robes magazine and flipping through it you playing a muggle sport draco wrinkled his nose sounds thrilling dontknock it till you try it i said looking at him evenly anyway it was fun draco shrugged but said that good so what did you do while i was gone i asked trying to appear casual i really wanted to know what he was up to just sat around here for a bit talked to some people blaise he said hmmm really i brushed a but of lint off my robe disinterested because quite honestly i didntcare really anyway i said you want to roam the castle kitchens maybe you arenttelling me weasel didntfeed you on your little escapade to muggle land draco asked eyeing me of course he did and dontcall him that i said but i just hate sitting in the common room but i do have homework and here is better than the library i reasoned then get to it sister draco said to me i stared at him what he asked i shook my head and went to get my books sometimes that boy made me wonder a n this is like 3 days later just letting you all know haha you know professor snape supposedly like us slytherins more but if that the case why in merlin name does he give us so much homework i whined hitting my hand on the table well lexi its not like he can give half of our class no homework and the other class a huge essay that blatant favoritism draco pointed out i sighed yeah i guess currently in potions we were brewing deflating drafts we had to write an essay on the proper way to brew and use the potion i myself thought this was silly seeing as how we were brewing it in class and the name was rather self explanatory do you think snape would give me extra credit if i suggested using the draft to deflate potter huge head i asked smirking draco laughed he wouldntpunish you that for sure hmmm i debated whether or not to put it in all honesty i had never much bothered with harassing potty before that was always draco hobby granger was always my target and besides he had just tried to be nice to me i guess i should cut him some slack even if i dontwant to talk to him i decided not to man i really was growing soft what was making me quell my urge to instigate with the little gryffindors george of course i grinned thinking of him he was absolutely wonderful lexi what are you doing pansy said how can you smile like that when you re doing your homework i shook my head at pansy stupidity hadntshe ever heard of a lack of concentration hmm i dontknow i said vaguely not really wanting to talk to anyone at the moment i picked my stuff up and excused myself to the library i needed to once again get away from my slytherin friends i opened the door to the library and peered in just a few random students whom i didntcare about granger ugh and cho i grinned as cho spotted me she motioned to the empty seat beside her in fact strangely she was sitting by herself hi cho i sat down why are you here all alone cho shrugged blaise just left and he doesntexactly get along with most of my friends i snorted lately blaise doesnteven get along with his own friends cho smiled sympathetically i ve been trying to hint at the fact that he should make up with you but she trailed off its fine i said i dontwant him to get mad at you too i sighed and got my work out what are you doing cho asked snape essay i paused sometimes i think i wouldntpass potions if i werentin slytherin cho laughed i actually liked potions well the potion making not the snape breathing down my neck part i grinned luckily potty and weasel occupy snape on that front in all actuality the fact that potter and weasel were in my class also probably gave my grade a boost since snape never really was too harsh on anyone but them someone said cho name and as she turned she accidentally knocked my ink bottle over ah no i shouted softly knowing it would completely ruin my essay not to mention my bag and robes stop and it did there sitting on my table was a bottle of ink frozen in a tilting position there were even a few drops that had splashed out frozen in midair wow i said softly looking up at cho who was still talking to her friend i quickly took the ink bottle and removed it not knowing what to do with the drops of ink i touched the mouth of the ink jar to them and they slid in cho turned around oh lexi i sorry did i knock your ink over i looked up at her yeah but uh it fine i caught it i said setting it back down on the other side of my essay okay so thats not exactly what happened but hey its well kind of true oh good reflexes she said you should be in quidditch i grinned slightly eh thanks for the offer but well then slytherin would just be completely unbeatable right i imitated draco famous drawl cho laughed i sure she paused anyway sorry but i have to go i ll talk to you later though i smiled okay actually i didntmind i wanted to be alone for a bit after cho left i gather my stuff up and went to the most secluded table at the library i sat down and got out my quill let see i said softly lifting the quill about a foot in the air i dropped it and whispered stop it stopped this was beyond strange hmm i thought for a moment and said go the quill fell to the desk i drew in a shaky breath what the hell i was intrigued i admit but i was also scared what if something was wrong with me what if i was abnormal even by wizarding standards wizards werentthe most receptive people when it came to abnormalities i closed my eyes i opened them picked up my quill and put it in my bag i stood up and walked towards the door i had no idea what was going on but i knew i was going to find out i felt a midnight trip to the restricted section of the library was in order and no one was going to find out about this for a while not draco not george a girl has to have some secrets right i got to the common room and quickly went upstairs avoiding anyone who might want to talk to me not that i had many people who would want to talk to me at the moment i put my things in my trunk and flopped down on my bed for a moment i sighed into my sheet and stretched i just needed to rest for a minute and clear my head again i felt stressed which was something unusual that was becoming highly usual in my life as of late i rolled over on my back and took in my surroundings our dorm as a whole was pretty neat there were some clothes hanging off some beds and some makeup scattered in a pile on the floor by pansy bed but it was neatly messy i sat up sighing i went down to the common room i glanced around and saw draco talking quietly with blaise who was sitting across from him on a couch he looked up at me and smiled patting the seat next to him i shifted my eyes but went over i sat down quietly trying to make myself as unnoticeable as possible where were you draco asked clearly either not noting my awkwardness or not caring library i said softly looking at my hands what followed next could only be described as an awkward silence i glanced up at blaise quickly and our eyes met i blinked and looked away ah lexi i need you to help me with my uhm essay why donti go get it draco said and before i could protest he was gone i sighed and blew at my bangs looking up at the ceiling so lexi uhm blaise paused how have you been i looked at him uhm pretty good i guess same old stuff i said looking towards the emerald fire in the fireplace it never provided much warmth but it was strangely entrancing listen lexi i know i haventbeen the greatest friend in the past couple weeks blaise said yeah you haven t i met his eyes he looked paler than usual and i knew i probably didntlook very comfortable and well i mean you have to understand it was quite a shock blaise started you hurt me i said quietly not many people can do that you know i looked up at him again my eyes wide i mean honestly out of the two of you i expected draco to get upset but you i paused i thought you d be the one to tell me everything would be all right i finished i sorry i looked up at blaise he shook his head i just sorry i looked at blaise and for once i was regret in his eyes i blinked it s i was cut off i was a prat and i knew it it just well you re really i dontknow you deserve the best and i guess i just thought you were selling yourself short he paused but your happiness is more important than anything else i smiled god i missed you i practically leapt over to him i missed you too lexi he hugged me right there in the middle of the common room with everyone watching but i didntcare i had my blaise back i sighed dontever do that to me again please i said frowning up at him i won t i really did miss you you know he paused we re probably the two most stubborn students in all of hogwarts i grinned oh most definitely so he began how are thing with wea george blaise said they re good i happy he cares about me and i paused i kinda care about him blaise nodded good luck then he glanced up draco you can come out now from wherever you are draco stepped out from the stairwell about bloody time you two made up he mumbled sitting down next to me i was between blaise and draco my two best friends and it sounds really romance novel cheesy but it was exactly where i belonged so draco blaise started since our lexi is a rebel and dating someone her father would never approve of no offense i nodded i feel we should track george down and give him a little talk me eyes widened no way i said looking back and forth draco grinned why blaise i do believe you re right they stood up lexi dear we will see you after dinner draco said he and blaise walking briskly out of the common room i sputtered and leapt up yelling if you scare him i ll never forgive you although i did have confidence that george could handle himself i sighed and sat back on the couch one of the complications in my life had been resolved but sadly i still had a few more i smiled blaise apologize he apologized to me it was very surprising but i was really happy about it i sighed and decided to go upstairs and get ready for dinner i wasntgoing to worry about what draco and blaise were saying to george for once i was going to relax at least until later tonight i walked up the stairs and pushed the door open with more force than i intended the door bounced off the door jam and came rushing back at me stop i said quietly once again it stopped i sighed the first time it happened i ruled it out as accidental magic but this was three times intentionally two of those times there was nothing accidental about this i wondered if i should visit the hospital wing i thought for a minute maybe this was some type of magic cold or disease maybe granger poisoned me somehow in our fight no i reasoned these side effects would have shown up long before now unless they werentsupposed to although granger poisoning me did make for a rather nice excuse i had a feeling that wasntthe reason this was happening as i washed my face i was more determined than ever to visit the library later tonight i brushed on some mascara and stood up i looked in the mirror wondering why george saw anything at all in me i sighed i was short as draco often liked to remind me and after being around draco and his perfectly silky blonde hair i had come to regard my less than perfect tresses with a tolerable distaste i was pale too a fact made more noticeable by the small amount of pigment in my freckles contrasting against my skin i shook my head my eyes took up three quarters of my face all in all i lexi a witch almost of age had the appearance of a small scared child i smiled slightly knowing that everyone must have some sort of self consciousness i guess purebloods arentimmune from everything i thought sarcastically i blinked well it wouldntdo any good for me to stand here and list my flaws i had granger for that i shook my head and grinned heading downstairs and out of the common room leila purred at me as i passed her while exiting i leaned down and scratched her behind the ears hey there my little kitty i haventseen you in a while i paused have you been making some animal friends if cats could roll their eyes i certain leila would have mmmhmmm i agree you re too perfect and adorable to associate with any of the other animals right she purred again rubbing against my legs go on up to my dorm and have a nice nap dear i cooed she looked at me happily and strutted into the common room i laughed softly and made my way to the great hall i sat silently eating my mashed potatoes when draco and blaise snuck up on me lexi draco said sitting down next to me and putting an arm around me how are you doll blaise sat down in an equally extravagant manner putting his elbows on the table and crossing his arms looking at me beaming what did you two do i asked shaking my head but grinning nonetheless oh nothing blaise said smiling entirely too innocently nothing my arse i exclaimed but i was really overjoyed i missed the playful banter between the three of us now really what did you say i swear if you scared him of then he wasntworth your time in the first place draco said seriously but dontworry yeah blaise sighed even though he a weasley draco cut him off a prankster a bloody wanker and a teacher to boot he still passed our inspection as far as his intentions with you go blaise finished i smiled really it was touching really i mean my parents in their own way loved me i guess but i had never seen someone as concerned for my well being as blaise draco and george they were concerned about lexi whereas my parents were mostly concerned with alexis blaise shook his head it was a tough decision but i guess our little lexi is growing up right before our eyes draco wiped away a fake tear next thing we know she ll be procreating little pale gingers with an over abundance of freckles i choked excuse me draco laughed and actual laugh nothing he smirked oh i ll get you back for that one i warned shaking my head at them i sighed in contentment and continued eating i missed this i snuck out of the slytherin common room at 1 am hopefully no teachers would be prowling and i could sneak into the library i hurried into the entrance hall slipping into a passageway that would take me directly to the hallway the library was in i heard footsteps as i neared the exit of the passageway and held my breath i heard weasley and granger and stifled a groan exactly what i needed come on hermione it one a m weasel was complaining there is no one out of bed besides we cantpatrol all night granger protested ronald honestly what if as soon as we leave someone commits an act of vandalism she paused making a clicking noise with her tongue if you arentgoing to take your responsibilities as a prefect seriously then maybe you should just go and talk to professor mcgonagall weasel sighed and i could practically sense him rolling his eyes mione there a difference between taking your duties seriously and becoming a hallway tyrant i grinned it seemed even someone with an infatuation towards granger couldnthandle her obsession with the rules oh fine but if something happens granger started but weasley cut her off then i ll admit you were completely right whatever let go i tired ron whined and i heard their footsteps heading away from the library i looked out the passageway quickly and no one was around i ran out of the passageway and down the hallway to the library doors quickly unlocking them and slipping inside i hurried through the shelves quickly reaching the restricted section i quickly went in and stopped what on earth was i looking for i rolled my eyes i barely knew how to locate books in the daytime with madame pince help let alone by myself at night in the restricted section i looked around one more time lighting my wand which in retrospect would ve been a good idea from the beginning ugh i just need a book that let me know what going on i thought preferably one that doesnttry and kill me i thought this over and over and suddenly a book flew out of a shelf to my left landing next to me i immediately ducked thinking this was some sort of trick to trap students like myself however no other books flew out at me so i grabbed the book and ran i hurried down the passageway and to the dungeons nearing the common room entrance i slipped in quickly hearing footsteps i listened on the other side of the wall i heard a meow mrs norris i sighed and went over to the couch by the fireplace opening the book i found the pages yellow and cracked with age animadverto sinus i read latin well obviously i read on also known as reality benders these people have the rare power to change what is around them in rarer cases they can change time when dealing with a small space such as an object or if very powerful a small room however no bender in history has even been able to do more than that not much is known about benders because they arentmany to be found and the few that are generally keep the secret to themselves i closed my eyes is that what i was what did it mean change the matter around them i opened my eyes trying to remember anything i could about matter i had thought that in muggle schools it was taught that everything was matter so if that be the case then technically i could shape the air into something else well i definitely understood the whole stopping time part anyway that was obviously what i had done with my ink i looked down another passage catching my eye reality benders however cannot make something out of nothing oh however they can merely change the shape direction or function of something close to them hmm well interesting i looked at the emerald green flames getting an idea i quickly thought and after a few moments the flames grew almost enough to set the carpet next tot he fireplace ablaze i quickly thought again and the flames died won i shook my head this was all too much i didntwant to be special this didnthelp me at all i decided then and there that no one could ever know about this it would only complicate things because i wasntstupid i knew what would happen if my parents or heaven forbid voldemort found out about this i would be done for i grabbed the book and went up to bed i d have to read through it the library would get it back eventually i was sure they wouldntmiss it too much and besides i need it after changing into my pajamas i climbed into bed thanking the good lord that tomorrow was a weekend i sorry i know that right now it probably seems like i trying to make lexi into some perfect perfect person but really i not this just needs to happen because it very vital to the plot so if this bothers you sorry but it has to happen anyway i hope you all enjoyed this chapter i liked writing most of it the last part was kind of weird though and lexi and blaise made up which was really nice to write because i hated having them fight hmmm i think that next chapter there going to be some drama oh hurrah haha so please review because really i would rather like to have more reviews for this chapter than i got for the last one and i ll get working on the next chapter right away i have a feeling that although i want to include drama in it it basically going to be another fluffy drama filler chapter booo 1so thank you to everyone who reviewed after i posted the last chapter i realized i didntexactly explain things well and i very sorry so hopefully this chapter will clear a lot of things up oh and also i thinking of writing a one shot companion to this called the talk lexi wontbe in it only draco blaise and george i think it would be a neat way to show everyone what was said during their little meeting without getting off track with this story thanks to the following reviewers krp thank you veryyyy much i realized after rereading my chapter after reading your review that i left many things unexplained however it did state in the book that she erm borrowed that no one could do anymore than stop an entire room and that only after being trained and being powerful to begin with lexi hasntshown any signs of wear from her powers yet but i was planning on that happening in this chapter for a reason and she wouldntkill anyone simply for the same reason that she isntcompletely supporting voldemort she isntevil and doesntwant to end up like him however this will all be explained but i should ve explained it in that chapter i just like to end at odd points sorry but thank you for pointing that out to me and i glad you like leila shifty eyes mcgee thanks i glad you like it that much anywho onto the chapter chapter 13 meeting i woke up the next morning feeling a lot more tired than usual i thought this odd but shrugged as i got out of bed and showered however when i got out of the shower and dressed i noted that my clocked said 3 15 in the afternoon i had slept almost the entire day away hadntanyone tried to wake me i threw on some robes and stormed downstairs pansy draco and blaise along with crabbe and goyle who barely registered on my radar were sitting around a table i walked up tot hem about time lexi blaise looked up draco and pansy turned around thanks for waking me up you guys half my day is wasted i snapped unusually cranky i tried to wake you up several times in fact i even got draco to come up pansy defended herself really i asked shaking my head there no way i was that hard to wake up it true lexi you wouldntbudge it was like you were dead or something draco said quietly i looked at him my eyes softening really yes really blaise chuckled he was so worried he kept saying that we should go get madame pomfrey but we all know how you would ve blown up at us i smiled weakly like i was dead i ve had my share of deep sleeps but nothing that i couldntbe woken up from with a bit of shaking and cold water as a last resort i sat down next to draco sorry i guess i just a bit worn out i leaned against the couch not joining in the conversation i was pretty tired today even with all the sleep i had gotten well maybe it isntso weird that i slept in i mean after all i went to bed at what 2 30 3 o clock not to mention the fact that doing that type of magic probably drains you i closed my eyes but if i can do it i should be able to handle it but what if i couldn t i frowned i had heard about what happened when wizards lost control of even wand magic it never ended prettily lexi draco said quietly i opened my eyes mhmm i smiled in acknowledgment we re going outside are you coming he asked i looked behind him to where blaise and pansy were standing awkwardly next to each other okay i stood up and walked over to the other two draco behind me he steadied me as i stumbled and i thanked him quietly are you okay he muttered in my ear you seem off today i fine just a bit tired i grinned at him he looked at me suspiciously so i decided to lead him off the subject so you never did tell me who you had to meet the other day i said in a casually loud voice that guaranteed pansy who was walking a few feet ahead of us with blaise would hear what drakey she stopped and screeched who are you meeting is there someone you want to tell me about draco glared at me as pansy interrogated him i smiled innocently it did keep draco off the subject of my being tired because if draco wanted to keep things secret so could i blaise fell in step with me so sleepy have a hard time getting to sleep last night i smiled you could say that true i had collapsed as soon as i got near my bed and fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow but i had been exhausted but now i felt fine tired granted but fine i felt bad though that people were worrying about me although it was flattering blaise dear i fine i said grinning really sometimes i just needs a day to recuperate blaise smiled yeah so do i i dontknow why draco made such a big deal out of it i mean not like he never slept the entire day before i laughed sometimes i think draco cares about people more than he lets on we all sat down outside underneath a tree by the lake i immediately laid down on the grass looking up at the blue sky scattered with the occasional cloud i sighed it a nice day draco said from next to me yeah it is surprising considering it november this was true the date was november 3rd next weekend was the first quidditch math of the season ravenclaw versus gryffindor everyone in the castle was eagerly anticipating something to keep their minds off the return of voldemort no one talked about it much other than what they read in the papers no one talked to us slytherins about it at all even the slytherins kept quiet about it for the most part but i wasntstupid i heard the whispers late at night in the common room about what they had heard from their parents how soon voldemort would rise stronger than ever with more support how someday soon he would even be able to take hogwarts which was a laughable thought at anything if voldemort somehow managed to get past all the ancient magic hogwarts was bound to have protecting it he d still have to face dumbledore and whether anyone liked to admit it or not dumbledore was a force to be reckoned with i was confident our school would be safe not that i would be in danger anyway but still hogwarts is comforting i think everyone no matter what type of family you have or what house you re in sees it as more of a home than the place they grew up at i loved hogwarts even with granger and weasel dumbledore and all those atrocious gryffindors i still loved it knut for your thoughts blaise said from the other side of me thinking about the future i said watching a snowy white owl fly above me into the owlery blaise made a noise in the back of his throat i felt my stomach grumble draco laughed want me to take you to the kitchens lex you did miss two meals after all he drawled looking at me pointedly i tried not to smile draco didntrealize it but he was much more likable when he wasntbeing an arrogant prat i d be much obliged i said standing up he followed suit and led me up to the castle draco really what have you been up to i asked as we made our way to the kitchen we turned and draco responded lexi it nothing just forget it it not nothing and you know it is it something bad illegal draco what if you get caught you arentpotter they wontgo easy on you you ll be expelled i stopped grabbing his arm just tell me please you sound more and more like granger each day draco said attempting to change the subject no draco it usually works but not this time i need to know i can help you i can no you cant help you could get caught i can handle myself he sighed lexi i just have some things i trying to do right now and i ll tell you about it when i know what going on myself just not right now okay i sighed i couldntargue with him anymore that for sure i was becoming eerily sleepy again besides if draco did want to keep it a secret he wouldnthave been so honest about the fact that he himself doesnteven have a full grasp on the situation so i could accept it for now all right i said but you re going to tell me i know we reached the painting i yawned as he tickled the pear you re still tired he asked as we went inside immediately being bombarded with house elves i dunno i guess i just in a lazy mood today thank merlin it the weekend i said sitting down my head resting on the table i sighed and closed my eyes why was i so tired is this what happened when i use my powers or whatever it is if this is what happened every time i used them i began to wonder if they were really worth having at all but then again maybe since i had used them so many times in such a short amount of time and it had been my first time using them that could explain it i would have to read up on it again tonight i ate my sandwich silently draco and i finished and we went back to the common room it was filled surprising considering what a nice day it was out we sat at a couch with two slytherin seventh years and thankfully draco kept up a good conversation with them so i didntparticipate much they left and i turned to draco they re pretty bland i thought slytherins were supposed to be unique against the mold have some character i glad to see you re sense of humor has remained in tact draco rolled his eyes why wouldntit i asked i dontknow i was kind of worried i thought you might be sick or something you arentsick are you because if you are you re going straight to the i not sick and even if i were i wouldntgo back there it so white draco it awful i complained becoming more alert i guess it was just taking me a while to wake up hey i said nudging draco i going to go see george for a bit okay i whispered you need to ask my permission he asked raising his eyebrows well no but i thought it d be nice of me to tell you anyway i smirked getting up well then i ll probably see you at dinner draco asked at the latest but i d say so i left i hurried quickly to george office hoping he d be there i knocked and he answered however behind him were three read haired people one was fred and the other two i had no idea i froze my eyes widening oh uhm sorry i started it okay they know george said leading me into the office fred grinned at me and i smiled weakly suddenly feeling like i was on display and realizing that i didntexactly look my best i had on old faded jeans and long sleeve emerald green top although it did have a scoop neck which was prettily lined with matching emerald green lace but still the other two who i assumed were the last of the weasley brothers stood up and grinned at me one was taller with longer red hair held back in a ponytail he wasntas stockily built as the twins and had a fang earring in his ear he seemed very nice and i shook his hand and smiled when i detected no maliciousness in his eyes that bill bill this is lexi george said quietly nice to meet you i said politely the next weasley brother was shorter much shorter than bill had been but somehow he still seemed tall to me anyway he looked much more like fred and george in build and his hair wasntas long i immediately like this weasley he has a sparkle in his eye that was similar to the twins and i knew that we would most likely get along i took his hand and shook it my smile wider more confident lexi this is charlie charlie lexi fred said this time hi i said there was an awkward pause where my eyes kind of drifted towards the filing cabinet so bill said does george always take this long in inviting you to sit down i laughed uhm not usually i looked at george he conjured another couch which i was impressed by incidentally come on i still in school and sat down patting the spot next to him i say down next to him and felt his arm go around my shoulders i was relieved then because everything seemed to be way less anxious and stressful sitting down with george next to me so charlie grinned you re lexi i looked around uhm that would be me i laughed nervously because really they were rather intimidating i mean who wouldntwonder how exactly bill got that dragon ring george squeezed my shoulder reassuringly i smiled at him so uhm what do you guys do i asked because yes although i didntwant to become a surrogate weasley i didntwant them all to hate me either especially since i dating their son sibling well i a dragon tamer i usually work in romania but i taking some time off to be with the family oh romania it must be nice i said more specifically i meant it must be nice to be that far away from your family well if he thought of his family the same way i thought of mine it pretty nice i like the work environment kind of like hagrid you know only i didntknow i never talked to hagrid ever and really i never understood why all the gryffindors were chummy with him honestly he nothing but a reckless nuisance oh i said looking at george i wasntreally sure how to respond to that bill sat there kind of staring at me i shifted around uncomfortably while i felt charlie was trying to make me as comfortable as possible in his presence i felt that bill was sizing me up before deciding how to treat me so george said how everything with fleur bill i grinned fleur delacour and bill i hadntheard of anything going on between them although fleur was an adult i suppose bill smiled it going well how about you george he said pointedly pretty good wouldntyou say lexi i smiled yep i paused i remember fleur she pretty nice i didnttalk to her much though bill smiled at me and i assumed that i passed his test really fred said i never did talk to her while at hogwarts so charlie said changing the subject how goes the joke shop business george and fred launched into an explanation about their joke shop about how some items were more popular than others and how the girl who they left in charge was doing a good job but of course it the school year so it isntthat busy which is why we took the job here i mean its not like we had anything else to do plus we can see what the students like as far as pranks go george finished you mean you re going to play pranks i asked on who well see on the entire school it brilliant actually george said yeah no one will suspect us fred added bill charlie and i laughed i cantwait i said but dontdo anything completely gross please i dontfancy having anything in my hair who said i would prank you george asked well you did say the entire school i said bill spoke up although you should make allowances for her george i mean she does put up with you after all he teased i giggled ohhh he has you there sweetie george and i looked at each other he grinned i blinked did i just call him sweetie oh god i turning into some kind of sap george grinned too true i smiled at him well he is really sweet charlie and bill only stayed a bit longer before telling fred and george that their mum expected a visit very soon they then said they had to go and george got up to see them out the door he said something to them too but i not exactly sure what it was sooooooo fred said how my dear friend alexis doing fred i said trying to scowl it lexi l e x i he shrugged so anyway how have you been hmm pretty good classes haventbeen too hard i said george came and sat back down beside me that good george smiled oh and blaise and i made up i grinned fred rolled his eyes but smiled woo hoo george squeezed my arm affectionately we could kind of tell by the way you guys were actually conversing at breakfast not to mention a little visit i got from i cut him off oh no they actually came and talked to you what did they say i asked worriedly george grinned oh nothing worth worrying about but i will admit they re pretty dedicated to protecting their little lexi i groaned i so sorry as you should be they could have beat me up george joked i think you could have taken them i replied smirking fred interrupted well i know i could have taken them but then again i am much stronger than georgie over there george rolled his eyes and i laughed oh yes fred we all know that george said they kept bantering and before long were wrestling on the floor you are such men i said laughing they both looked up at me then looked at each other identical grins on their faces what i asked my eyes widening why are you guys looking at me like that we re men george did you hear fred asked looking at george in mock surprise why yes fred i did george said in the same joking tone hmmm quite an observation from your little girlfriend too true how could we ever thank her for pointing this out to us i dont know george do you have any ideas i do have one they looked at me again and came towards me ohhh no oh no you don t i hopped up from the couch and ran around it which in a normal situation would have made me safe for the time being but i had forgotten that fred and george were two people and could easily corner me gah i said as they began tickling me two against one isntfair after a while the twins let up and we continued talking about stupid stuff all i saying is the chicken definitely came first fred argued george replied no the egg had to have come first i shrugged i hate eggs i paused chicken is good though fred grinned so you agree with me he said george looked offended i laughed no i never said that i just said i liked chicken yeah yeah well i going to go i see i never going to win here fred left that made no sense whatsoever i told george i know he laughed do you think bill and charlie liked me i asked nervously i knew i didntexactly make great first impressions i always thought that i was pretty awkward around people i didntknow and i really wanted to make a good impression on george family i guess i kind of wanted to prove that no matter what family i came from or what house i was in i could still be a good person of course they liked you george kissed me on the forehead what not to like i smiled you re so sweet george and i sat in silence for a while it was a comfortable silence and it was nice george was actually pretty wonderful when i thought about it he was sweet funny kind he cared about me he was always there for me to talk or listen or give me advice he always cheered me up and just talking to him made my day instantly better i smiled just thinking about him and then i broke the silence i love you george eyes snapped open what i sat up what did i just say i uhm i i trailed off my eyes darting over to him i love you i love you why would i say that did i really love george george looked as dumbfounded as i felt and that just made me feel worse i uh have to go i stood up and hurried over to the door quickly leaving running away more like i ran outside and to a secluded spot near the castle i sat down on a bench and breathed deeply for a few moments did i love george i wasntsure i wasntreally sure what love was in the first place i cared about george certainly i loved things about him like his hair and his laugh and his personality and sense of humor but did that mean that i loved him and why had he been silent after i said that why couldnthe say anything in return and why did it hurt me so much that he didn t that when i realized that i did love george that why it hurt so much it hurt because he didnttell me that he felt the same he didntsay he loved me and it hurt but did he love me if he did i dontsee why he wouldntsay it i sat there for a while missing dinner and not really caring and after all that thought i only knew one thing for certain unrequited love a bitch wheee so that wasntas much of a filler chapter as i thought it would be actually it quite important hahaha anyway i hope you liked it i actually did like this chapter although some parts sound funny i dontknow i just crazy anyway pleaseeeeee review hmm hmm well i wrote the talk and i kinda really like how it came out so if you haventalready looked at it i suggest you do it pretty cute and by the way for some reason i like obsessed with listening to the song the curse of curves by cute is what we aim for it really rather sad even cartel cantget me to stop listening to it o o okay now i listening to something else hoo okay i done with all that probably boring you thanks to the following reviewers tobias potter thank you i glad you like it krp hahaha i can definitely sleep in until 3 in the afternoon but the sun is pretty bothersome when i trying to sleep in too ah yeah bill didnttalk much i mean i dontwant all the weasley to automatically love her and bill even though he a great character seemed like one who wouldnttake to lexi immediately thanks for the review crea hahahaha thank you and the talk is up and well i like it hah serena anne yay new reviewer thanks live2sk8 hehehe thank you so much yeah i couldnthave blaise and lexi fight too long because she pretty much needs him well kind of and as for harry and lexi i really like writing them together because they really should get along but they really dontwant to thanks whisperwings awe that was a really nice review haha sorry for making you wait so long steph thanks chapter 14 fred weasley professional prankster and psychiatrist i eventually realized that i needed to go back inside because if i didn t draco would surely have a conniption which wouldntbe pretty i picked myself up off the bench dusting my clothes off i slowly made my way into the castle and to my common room draco and blaise were of course waiting for me where have you been draco hissed as i walked in out i wasntin the mood to talk and somehow i didntthink draco would understand why i was so upset out where draco didntlike being brushed off very much out out i responded out side if you must know which of course he did why didntyou come to dinner blaise asked wasnthungry lost track of the time i paused i not like you guys i dontrevolve my life around meals i attempted to lighten the mood which it was true i did lose track of time and well i just didntwant to see george well are you hungry now draco asked erm kind of actually i was hungry this will be the second kitchens stop today draco said heading out of the common room i laughed and blaise and i followed we went to the kitchen and me being the upset female that i am requested large amounts of chocolate so draco said sitting down i sat down and stuffed a chocolate chocolate chip cupcake into my mouth i swallowed so either it that time of the month draco moved as i hit him or you re really upset wow drakeykins is pretty observant much more than i give him credit for and since we dontknow your cycle of all things blaise shuddered we dontknow which i shrugged neither maybe i just like chocolate maybe i figure it time for me to gain some weight i paused or maybe i just figured it time to start a revolution where women can eat what they want is that so wrong i mock glared at my two best friends i would definitely say it that time of the month draco said blaise nodded well okay so he isntthat observant so blaise how goes things with cho i changed the subject i didntexactly want to discuss my time of the month with anyone of the male gender especially not draco and blaise actually really good i might ask her out soon blaise said you mean you haven t i asked surprised blaise was usually a go getter when it came to girls no i haven t i taking my time blaise paused potter traumatized the poor girl oh now that a bit of an exaggeration potter was a git but it not like he did it on purpose he just an insensitive prat without trying to be not that i defending potter i not i just think that cho a bit strong to be traumatized by that honestly mhmm i said well better get a move on buster blaise raised an eyebrow at me yeah i just saying cho a pretty girl and she wontbe single forever i said draco nodded true zabini we stood up and left the kitchens well then i ll ask her tomorrow maybe yes i jumped up and laughed draco looked at me you re completely insane i am not insane i am laughing do i need a reason to laugh draco rolled his eyes well most people take random outbursts of laughter as a sign of insanity i grinned you love me unfortunately well at least someone loves me even though they didntknow it draco and blaise kind of cheered me up the next day was sunday and the official start of the week leading up to the first quidditch match of the season i personally hoped that ravenclaw kicked some gryffindor arse it was the typical setup ravenclaw of course wanted to win and the slytherin wanted ravenclaw to win simply to beat gryffindor hufflepuffs were mostly split between the two teams and obviously gryffindor stood behind their pottyhead led team cho was understandably nervous at breakfast she was seeker after all and captain she didnttalk to anyone at breakfast instead going over plays in a way that reminded me of oliver wood you should ask her out mate she looks stressed a nice snog would do her good draco said to blaise what snogging was draco solution for everything i swear no wonder he couldntkeep a steady girlfriend you men are all alike a nice snog is not the cure for everything blaise you just need to be there for her that all i snapped gah men i sat down between the two dunderheads and started to pile pancakes on my plate of course snogging helps everything draco sounded offended draco you are such a a a testosterone filled male i said slamming my fork down girls can actually keep a lid on their hormones and donthave to have someone mouth on theirs every chance they get i said before returning to eating draco opened his mouth but what about pan pansy doesntcount she a whore i smiled sweetly draco and blaise laughed and dropped the subject hmm chocolate chip filled pancakes sounds good dontthey i asked not particularly they sound gross blaise answered eating his bacon i think they sounds tasty i said standing up and stretching slightly see you guys later i walked out of the great hall i worked in the library most of the day it was a nice way to get my mind off george in all honesty i was really unsure of what to do i had already acknowledged that it was stupid of me to tell him that i loved him but i did and did he really not love me back well obviously if he did he would have said so right so he didntlove me i guess i could deal with that maybe possibly but i just couldntgo up to him and act like nothing happened i sighed and wrote down another characteristic of banshees conrad i looked up weasley ron to be specific what the hell do you want i asked he sat down so so i hate you you hate me and you randomly come up to me and all you have to say is so you re dating george you re a quick one i snorted why i shook my head because i like him haventyour parents explained this to you yet he blushed shut up conrad i came to tell you that as much as i hate the thought of you swapping spit with my brother i not going to tell my mum he snapped ooh bravo on not being a snitch i said sarcastically really i was kind of grateful i had heard about mrs weasley she was like super mum or something i not doing it for you or anything it for george eventually he ll realize what a mistake he making and my mum doesntneed to be stressed with it not only that but he ll be embarrassed enough about the fact that he dated you without my mum knowing ron said smirking i hate him at least i can get what i want how long have you been chasing after granger i paused too bad she chosen just about everyone over you face it weasel you re nothing to her so yeah that was a bit mean but i dontreally care much weasley flushed and answered i dont like hermione please i rolled my eyes you re sitting here trying to convince me someone who doesntgive two damns about your life that you donthave feelings for a girl she got you whipped i smirked triumphantly if i gained any knowledge from being friends with draco and blaise it was that guys hated being told that they were whipped ron sputtered fuck off conrad he left another win for the slytherin queen lexi conrad hurrah okay so referring to myself as a queen is a bit conceited but really if i not the queen of slytherin who is pansy i think not i blinked weasley told me to fuck off honestly all of the golden trio had been swearing more than usual lately i shook my head i didntcare i finished my essay and walked out of the library and right into fred weasley oh ah fred i picked my bag up off the floor hey lexi just the little snake i was looking for he put an arm around me and led me away why were you looking for me i asked well i had something to talk to you about of course fred said grinning i smiled i didntreally need an excuse to talk to fred after all he was my friend oh really what i asked curious fred said let wait until we get to my office bloody gossips around here he trailed off i had to agree with him hogwarts created more busybodies than actual decent wizards eventually we got to fred off he opened the door and ushered me into a chair and sat down behind his desk so he said are you all right i smiled of course why wouldnti be ohhh i dontknow just that you werentat dinner fred paused and george seemed out of it not upset but kind of anxious he kept looking around for you oh did you two have a fight i hesitated we hadntexactly had a chance to fight since i ran off not exactly well then what wrong did he say something stupid because well i know george and he often says stupid things but i sure he didntmean it i closed my eyes fred it not what he said it really what he didnt say fred squinted at me what do you mean i felt very embarrassed well you see i uh i kind of maybe might have perhaps accidentally but not so much so really did tell george that i loved him i sighed fred grinned well what so bad about that i looked up at fred grinning face it was so much like george s but it wasn t i was so angry unexplainably angry i shook my head what wrong fred is that he doesntfeel that way about me he doesntlove me and i dontwant him to say it if he doesn t so me saying it just was stupid it caused so many problems that neither of us wanted or needed i said fred frowned what are you on about he doesntlove you did he say that i rolled my eyes obviously not george does have some tact but he didntsay he loved me either fred thought for a moment well then if he didntsay he loved you and he didntsay he didnt love you what did he say fred come on just stop it i stood up why are you doing this fred ran around the desk to stop me from leaving because lexi i your friend and george is my brother and you make him happy and i know he must make you happy too right right i said grudgingly he steered me back to a chair so why are you willing to let this one little miscommunication ruin that hmm fred asked sitting back down at his desk i never said that i said oh really fred smiled knowingly so tell me dear lexi what exactly was your brilliant course of action i bit my lower lip my plan of action was pretty much nonexistent well i hadntexactly thought of what to do but i sure it ll work itself out i said not if you both donttalk to each other fred said in a singsong voice i growled under my breath he had a point i didntwant this to change things well what do you think i should do then i asked rolling my eyes tell me what happened first fred said i sighed i donteven know what happened one minute we re sitting there the next i all like i love you it just came out and then fred was being extraordinarily patient and sweet and then it was silent it was so awkward i ve never felt so uncomfortable around him before then i finally looked at him and god fred it was awful the look on his face just he looked so taken aback and nervous and out of place like he would ve preferred that i hadntsaid anything at all and he couldntsay anything i paused he just sat there like he couldntthink of anything to say to make the situation better he obviously doesntreturn my feelings so i left ran away more like fred raised an eyebrow at me which he must ve done a million times since i had started talking to him the difference this time was that he wasntjoking or being cocky or anything he was completely serious maybe i dontknow i felt terrible fred i wasntexactly thinking clearly i snapped so he didntsay anything fred asked no he didnthave to his face said it all i said miserably lexi let me tell you a pretty obvious secret about men while some of us may be smooth when trying to woo a girl he pointed to himself i snorted but he continued none of us are very sensitive of smart when it comes to dealing with emotions i already knew that but i dontsee what that has to do he cut me off a lot if you ll let me finish now did you ever stop to think that george may have had that look on his face not out of disgust or fear or whatever but because he simply didntknow how to respond to what you said but it isntvery hard when a girl tells you she loves you you should again i was cut off but there the difference lexi what he should ve done and how he actually responded you have to give us guys a break it hard enough to decipher how you feel about us this isnta romance novel we cantsay the right things at the right time all the time fred paused for someone who showed about as much tact as a bull in a china shop fred was making a lot of good points he could have come after me i said softly yes he could have but you have to realize what it felt like for him first you say you love him which i know probably made his day and then you run off now how nervous were you after saying that fred asked really nervous i admitted exactly and you re the one who said it and knew that how you felt think of how nervous george was especially after you ran out fred paused he might think that you didntmean it that you regret saying it i looked down i hadntthought of that what if george thought that i didntlove him see a huge miscommunication dontblame georgie it not his fault he isntas suave as me fred usual attitude returned i rolled my eyes oh of course i paused so uh what exactly should i do fred i looked at him talk to him cantyou tell him to talk to me i pleaded sorry dollface i ve done enough fred grinned at me you talk to him but what do i say i whined you have to figure it out for yourself you loveee him remember just oh what is that line follow your heart fred grinned at me you are such a dork fred i said smiling there that smile george talks so much about fred laughed i blushed stop it fred i laughed thank you though dontmention it my fair lady fred bowed extravagantly i smirked you are so overly dramatic oh get out fred shooed me away shutting the door behind me thanks i called through the door fred was so obviously a weasley twin i sighed i should go talk to george tonight and get things straightened out but i needed to think about what i was going to say i knew i was procrastinating but i didntexactly care i headed for the great hall for lunch so i could deal with the fact that george doesntlove me like i love him he still cares about me right so maybe someday he will love me well before i started thinking of ways to deal with him not loving me i had to talk to him i sat down and ladled some soup into my bowl it was kind of ironic that i was having these kind of problems i mean who would have thought i sighed looking up as draco and blaise came in where were you draco asked this was becoming a regular occurrence library i stated doing what draco pressed draco please i am not a child you re my friend not my father i snapped which really wasnta regular occurrence for us anyway draco looked shocked and a bit hurt sorry it just you guys baby me so much and you know i perfectly capable of taking care of myself i said not that i dontappreciate it or anything i do draco grinned no problem lexi blaise grabbed a sandwich so finish that defense essay i grinned maybe ask cho out yet no chicken not really yes pretty much guys shut up draco ended our banter what do we have tomorrow i asked as a buttered a roll defense potions charms and marketing blaise replied i nearly stabbed my hand with the butter knife i was holding so i had to talk to george before tomorrow or else marketing would be extremely awkward to say the least blaise draco and i went back to the common room i watched them play exploding snap before we all went outside we sat in the courtyard just talking about stupid stuff like who houses we were going to for christmas i didntknow how i would get a chance to get away and talk to george draco and blaise had obviously had enough of my mysterious disappearances lexi can i please have your defense essay blaise asked only if i can have your charm homework i replied blaise nodded and we switched draco scoffed am i the only one who did all of my homework not my fault you re so stupid drakey i smiled sweetly at him he growled but rolled his eyes okay lexi i the stupid one right i glad you finally realize it i exclaimed moving around on the bench draco shook his head lexi stop squirming around you re going to spill ink all over your essay he held my ink bottle for me i grinned at him so maybe draco and blaise werentperfect they were bossy and overprotective and thought i was a fragile little sissy but they loved me and i was eternally grateful okay that was kinda short but schools is starting soon and i wanted tog et a chapter out before next chapter should be lexi talking to george and the oh so fun quidditch game 1oh my god no one told me that i would have so much homework okay so like i sorry i haventupdated but honestly i take all honors classes except history which i take as an ap course college for those of you who dontknow so it pretty hectic since i have like 4 hours of homework every night it ridiculous 10th grade is waaaay harder than i expected not the actual learning but just the amount of work they expect you to do but oh well enough of my rant anyway i was really pleased that i got so many reviews really i was like hurrah but anyway thank you guys seriously thanks to the following reviewers kainda yeah i know thats why i try to have a nice pace in the story i mean who falls in love that quickly and i love draco too mg thank you so much i glad you still like it live2sk8 ahh i know i love sweet guys hahaha draco and blaise i know are probably a bit ooc but well i frankly dontcare much well i do captain speed o i actually got that kind of off of sex and the city episode where carrie tells mr big she loves him only well i changed it a bit yeah i a really big loser haha crea i was going to put lexi and george in this chapter but i didntwant the part with fred to lose it importance because lexi and fred interaction is very important to this story pop tarts thanks i glad thanks i love draco and blaise too whisperwings haha i know what you mean i have a few friends like that and i really appreciate them thanks krp thanks yeah i know fred isntusually the psychological type but i really couldntthink of anyone else who could talk to her about this i was actually considering harry for a bit but then i figured it would be better for fred to help her in the long run and plus i think the whole twin thing would maybe make him more intuitive when it comes to george hahaha chapter 15 pranks and quidditch the next morning i woke up as i normally do i went and showered as i normally do it was when i got out of the shower that things started to go crazy what the hell i shrieked wrapping a towel around myself i quickly ran over to the mirror my normally ash blonde hair was now changed to a shimmering deep red with gold streaks running through no no this has to be wrong i closed my eyes tight and opened them again damnit could be heard throughout the slytherin dorms i ran to my room the girls in our dorm were slowly waking i grabbed a towel and put it on my head before grabbing my clothes and running into the bathroom locking the door i quickly put on my uniform and ran out of my dorm and down the steps lexi bloody hell shut up a fifth year girl said to me go to hell i replied my problem was way more important than any missed sleep she had gotten draco blaise open the damn door please i banged on the door to the 6th grade boys dorms lexi blaise answered his hair a mess in any other situation i would ve laughed what wrong why do you have a towel on your head i walked into the boys dorm ignoring the sloppiness of it i grabbed blaise hand and draco arm and led them into the bathroom shutting and locking the door this is what wrong i pulled the towel off my head blaise and draco stared their eyes widening what the blaise trailed off draco blinked lexi i do believe you ve just been the victim of a gryffindor prank not only that but you ve been singled out blaise added well that pretty obvious fuck i said well we obviously cantstand for this draco said blaise nodded someone has to pay yeah i added this was after all my head that had been violated my money on the golden trio draco spat blaise agreed probably getting you back for fighting with granger and for dating george i thought out loud draco tried numerous spells to get my hair to return to it original color but to no avail well there nothing i can do draco said i dontwhat this is i mean i cantdo anything blaise wrapped an arm around me stay here till we get dressed lexi we ll go down together and if anyone so much glances at your hair we ll hex them i nodded draco and blaise hurried out shutting the door behind them i leaned against the door hearing the voices of the boys what she doing in there i need to shower nott complained sod off you can wait five bloody minutes blaise replied i smirked draco knocked on the door a few minutes later lexi are you ready i guess so i sighed and opened the door the boys all gawked at me and i felt my face flush is there a problem draco hissed i had to stifle a laugh as everyone eyes darted away at once we went down to the common room and the boys told me to go get my bag which i did draco and blaise smiled sympathetically at me as i came down this is awful you guys i said frowning blaise put an arm around me as we walked into the hallway we were silent up until we reached the great hall draco and blaise stepped in front of me protectively and i grinned how sweet they opened the doors and we walked inside i looked down at my feet hearing gasps and intakes of breath most of them were quickly punctured by glares sent by draco and blaise when we reached the gryffindor table i looked up to see the golden trio trying to quiet their laughter ginny smiled but looked rather sympathetic i glared at all of them we sat down i hate them i said glaring at the gryffindors once again draco smirked you know that red hair kind of makes you look like a weasl dont even say it i said turning my glare to him draco grinned awe lexi now you and your boyfriend have matching hair draco shut it i growled i glared around the room again shooting the golden trio a particularly vicious look they just smirked at me in response they were so going to get it fred caught my eye george wasntthere yet he looked at me sympathetically i pouted yes pouted i looked down at my food plotting various ways to get back at the golden trio forget it the whole gryffindor house is going to pay for this i looked up to see george walk in i looked down so that my hair covered my face and watched him i just wanted to see his reaction to this would he think it was funny i hoped not fred whispered to george and he looked over to me george followed his gaze and his eyes widened before turning back to fred and whispering again they both then left the hall i blinked i watched as the golden trio walked by weasley muttered nice hair conrad and blaise and draco were on their feet what did you say weasel draco snapped weasley shrugged and walked out of the hall following the golden trio we quickly followed you think you can actually get away with this blaise scoffed out in the hall we dontknow what your talking about zabini potter said coolly i clenched my fists this my hair your maturity astounds me really too bad it blatantly obvious that you did it oh alexis you changed your hair i cantreally say it looks that great granger smirked piss off granger it really sad that even when my hair looks like this it still looks better than your bushy mess i paused has anyone ever introduced you to a brush granger flushed and weasley said leave her alone oh please like we re going to listen to you king weasel draco drawled a n alliteration watch it malfoy potter said i stepped in front of draco and blaise glaring menacingly at potter which was hard might i add by the fact that he was much taller than me no pottyhead you listen to me did you really think you could do this to me me and get away with it i paused i dontknow how you expect to be treated but nobody treats a conrad like this ever especially not a know it all a weasel and the boy who just won t bloody drop dead i stopped dramatically you will pay watch your back potter i turned and walked away draco and blaise following shortly after threatening potty so we are going to get them back for this right i asked of course draco replied they ll regret it blaise nodded i grinned bloody right they will we walked up the stairs towards the defense room it was pretty empty when we got there which i thought was good for me since i wouldntattract much attention going in we sat in our corner and waited for class to start professor tally walked in good morning good morning she glanced around the room her eyes stopping on me for a moment i smiled weakly she raised her eyebrows but said nothing take out your books today you ll be outlining the difference between werewolf bites during the full moon and bites from lycanthropes when the moon isntfull tally waved her wand at the board and notes appeared i took out a quill and piece of parchment and started to copy them down listening to her lecture so as you can see class people bitten by lycanthropes when there is no full moon are not affected with the same type of lycanthropy as most werewolves instead the person has a more dormant form resulting in slightly animalistic tendencies during the full moon but nothing extremely serious unless provoked tally looked around the room for friday i was a 6 inch essay on today lesson you may start working until the end of class i had only gotten the first paragraph of my essay written by the time class ended i sighed blaise draco and i stood up and left the classroom as we walked down the hallways people kept whispering and snickering to each other some even openly pointed at me at least potions is next snape wontlet anyone say anything draco assured me that was true snape never let anyone say anything to someone in his house i grinned almost hoping that some stupid gryffindor would say something to me i would have the last laugh surely we sat in our usual spots me between draco and blaise snape nodded towards us briefly before looking around the class nice hair conrad lavender brown said shrilly before turning to giggle with her little posse i turned around angrily to say something snape beat me to it miss brown if you would kindly keep your eyes on my lesson he spat if you d like to gossip you can do so tonight in detention 15 points from gryffindor for disrupting my class i grinned i loved snape well okay maybe not loved but well thought of fondly snape class was rough not only was it a double period but we had to take notes and brew an extremely complicated potion i sighed after cutting up my shriveled root and ran my fingers through my hair snape walked by miss conrad i couldnthelp but notice you latest style he chose his words delicately i didntchoose it sir i said politely someone did this to me i glanced over at the golden trio of course i have no proof but i think we both have a rough idea as to who was behind it i know personally there only one student in this school who can cast a charm this well i looked snape in the eyes are you catching my drift sir snape looked over at potter weasel and granger indeed i am miss conrad we finished our potion snape graded it as an o and actually let us out early he said that it was so that i could avoid the rush draco blaise and i walked into the great hall and took our usual seats at the table i started eating my ham sandwich and draco and blaise started discussing various ways to get back at the gryffindors i personally vote that we infiltrate their house from within you know that not all those gryffindors are goody goodies draco said rubbish one every gryffindor is a goody goody and two we dontneed their help to get back at the golden trio they may have granger but we re much more talented than she is blaise argued i ate in silence wondering why neither of them were asking for my input especially since i was the on who had been pranked the great hall filled up quickly and although i got a few curious glances not many people looked my way whether it was becuase my hair was old news or because of the fact that i was sitting by draco and blaise i couldnttell but i certainly wasntcomplaining draco blaise let just just help me get through today and when whatever this is wears off then we can worry about what we re going to do okay i said sighing blaise took a breath as though to say something then stopped what he said i said we ll think of something after this wears off okay i said irritated well lexi it looks like we donthave to draco said hesitantly my head snapped up and i looked towards the doors my jaw dropped along with the jaw of every other person in the hall standing there was the great harry potter and his sidekicks granger and weasel deck from head to toe in slytherin colors and when i say head to toe i mean head to toe their hair of course was silver and their bodies were entirely painted green their robes were green with silver lining and each of them had a snake slithering around their waists like a belt which the belt part was pretty neat i must say although granger looked a bit distressed about that all in all each of them looked pretty pissed and they were coming my way i couldntstop smiling and neither could any of the other people at my table especially when the golden trio came to a stop right in front of me hello lexi granger said brightly i frowned it was granger but somehow it wasn t such a lovely day weasel added my someone seems to have done quite a number on your hair potty chimed in it was then i realized that some major bewitching had gone on would you like me to fix that for you lexi i mean hair as pretty as yours cantbe damaged like this granger said pulling out her wand i grinned as she said the incantation and tugged at the end of one of my strands of hair i could see it was ash blonde again uhm well i paused not sure of what to do goodbye wait weasley said before handing me a note it was folded and had a number 1 on it granger and potter each handed me similar notes only with the numbers 2 and 3 on them see you lexi potter called you should give me some fashion tips sometime granger said waving at me i burst into laughter whenever this spell wore off granger was going to be kicking herself i looked down at the notes in my hand draco and blaise were looking at them suspiciously i looked at them and dived out of the way just in time no guys they re my notes not yours now i going to go read them before class and you are going to leave me alone i said sprinting out of the hall i practically ran to my dormitory shutting and locking the door behind me i jumped onto my bed and laid the notes out in front of me in order i was so excited for some reason i opened the first one lexi i read it was scrawled in tiny handwriting small but neat i liked it i opened the next one i sorry about them and i sorry i messed up i closed my eyes george i should have known who else would have done this i opened the third one i love you a million things exploded inside me at once i shrieked and jumped off my bed he loves me he loves me he loves me he loves me i shouted i dontthink i could ever recall a moment in my life that had ever made me so happy i sighed and laid back on my bed i was in love and he loved me back i dontthink it gets much more perfect than that i hopped off my bed scooping the notes up and putting them into my pocket what had started off being one of the worst days of my year had in one second turned into one of the best days of my entire life and i couldntwait to get to marketing class the day flew by after that and nothing anyone could say would ve brought me down lexi draco asked on our way to marketing are you okay of course i okay why wouldnti be okay i grinned it such a great day drakey we walked into the classroom and i almost burst into laughter at seeing the golden trio while they had returned to normal personality wise they were still class in their fetching slytherin outfits i grinned what so funny conrad weasley spit did i say anything you know you re awfully conceited you always think anything that someone says or does has something to do with you and it doesn t hate to break it to you rodent but the world doesntrevolve around you i smiled sweetly like i said nothing could ruin my mood this coming from the great princess lexi granger muttered awe granger i glad you recognize my superiority i walked over to my desk and sat down i knew that last comment was treading on shaky ground and george wouldntbe especially happy if he heard it i was kind of pushing it but well i was deliriously happy you arentexactly thoughtful george and fred waltzed in just as the bell was ringing as usual so today we re going to continue working on our products but we re going to work on advertising george said after they quickly took attendance now a good ad first and foremost has to be eye catching i mean if it looks like rubbish no one is going to bother giving it a second glance fred said but it also has to include information that persuade the possible customer to buy said product george added facts and statistics are the best when talking about products that are supposed to be better than other products that are the same thing fred continued but it also good to just have silly little reasons as to why someone should buy it george finished now we ll be walking around to check your progress you all can come up and get a sheet of drawing paper for your ad sketch then next class we ll actually talk about color schemes the class went on normally our sketch looked nice but i cantsay i remember what was on it much i didntdo a lot of work that class period but no one in my group seemed to mind i assumed they could guess i was kind of preoccupied he loved me it kept going through my head like a mantra when classes finally ended for the day i told draco and blaise to go ahead they looked at me a moment then shook their head simultaneously way to be obvious draco said i squeaked in protest but they just smirked at me i am not obvious the classroom cleared out until it was just fred george and i george was bent over his desk sorting his papers and fred was standing next to him he looked at me and grinned mischievously then he promptly walked out of the room and shut the door for once i was glad fred mind was always in the gutter i walked up behind george i wasntexactly sure how i would begin a conversation with him so i did the first thing that i could think of thank you thank you thank you thank you i spun him around and jumped on him wrapping my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist he grinned for what he asked for everything i paused i love you he kissed me lightly on the lips i love you too nothing could be better than this things only got better between george and myself and in turn almost every aspect of my life got better he helped me with my homework and my grades improved to even more than they had already been he made me so happy that barely anything bothered me anymore even granger constant attempts to get me angry werenthaving an effect i was sitting at breakfast when one thing happened that reminded me that george couldntmake every aspect of my life better the owl post came no the letter wasntfor me but it scared me nonetheless a rather inconspicuous owl landed in front of draco he took the scroll of parchment from the owl beak and opened it almost immediately his face got white as a sheet and the letter fell to the table he excused himself rather quickly i picked the letter up quickly and followed reading it oh my i thought as i looked at the quick message d christmas meet him l christmas why draco wasntsupposed to be inaugurated until after the school year was over i paused wait a minute i was going to draco for a majority of christmas break did this mean i would have to no no no no my parents wouldntsubject me to that they wouldn t i found draco in the common room he didntsay anything as a sat down next to him but leaned into the hug i gave him it ll be okay draco you probably wonteven have to talk to him maybe just see him i said reassuringly lexi draco said turning to me i need your help i bit my lower lip i knew draco was getting in over his head but he was my best friend and i would do anything for him i ll do anything i can i said i need to learn legilimency and i need you to teach me draco said completely serious me of course i ll try draco but i donteven know how to do it myself wouldntblaise be a better pick i asked no no one else can have any idea that i dontwant the dark lord to know what i thinking only you lex do you understand draco eyes held a strange vulnerability i had never seen he was asking me for help he was relying on someone else and he never did that i understand and you will learn it i promise i gave draco another hug i wouldntlet him down all thoughts of the dark lord or legilimency were quickly pushed out of everyone mind with the upcoming quidditch match ravenclaw vs gryffindor tensions were unusually high espeically for a match that wasntgryffindor vs slytherin this was becuase cho was determined to beat harry and prove to the entire school that she wasnta weak little girl the morning of the game everyone was in high spirits draco blaise pansy crabbe goyle and i after eating headed down to the stands to get prime seats which we always had of course for a november day it was pretty cold windy too i had on my cloak scarf and mittens and draco let me use him warm hat much to the chagrin of pansy i cantwait to see the new plays cho has come up with i squeaked excitedly walking between my two best friends calm down lexi i sure chang will be fine draco responded as we began climbing up into the stands i hope so potter needs to be taken down a peg blaise said not only that but you just want to see you wittle chooey win and be happy i cooed blaise smiled slightly but didntsay anything well i am very sorry but i am really awful at writing quidditch scenes so i just skipping until nearly the end of the game it had been a rugged game not rugged in the sense that both teams cheated because of course they didn t rugged in the fact that the teams were evenly matched and cho defensive plays proved to be absolutely brilliant the snitch had been seldom seen during the game potter and cho were both flitting around the field neither wanting to miss an opportunity the score was 100 140 with gryffindor winning them cho went into a steep dive potter soon following after her as they near the ground potter started to lean back on his broom slowing it down cho however kept going she grabbed the snitch by one of it wings and hit the ground i gasped cho i stumbled out of the stands as fast as i could blaise and draco behind me but for different reasons blaise was concerned for cho whereas draco was concerned for me oh cho i said in anxiety every ravenclaw seemed to be crowding around her who won i heard someone ask behind me i turned around angrily weasley what is your problem weasley cho hurt i think that a little more important than a silly little quidditch game you re ridiculously pathetic i snapped he stood there mouth open i shook my head and turned around seeing an opening in the crowd i rushed forward dragging blaise with me i hoped cho would be all right oooooh cliffhanger sorry this took so long to update but i hope you like it i ll try and get the next one out as soon as possible review please well once again schoolwork has gotten the best of me but with the end of the year and summer starting i can update a lot more well anyway thank you all so much for being so patient i really appreciate it thanks to the following reviewers nazgulgirl thanks i trying to update as quickly as i can but hopefully when summer comes i can update more quickly captain speed o wow thank you so much you always say such nice things you re one of my favorite reviewers captianjacksgrl oh dontworry cho should be fine i would bet hahah thanks krp ah i knew something was wrong there ugh i guess that what i get for trying to hurry and finish a chapter well thank you for pointing that out haha mavisclone the notes were just a cute way of him saying it i guess and simultaneously getting back at harry ron and hermione and yes i did only leave an update to keep you all wanting more muahahahaha crea i trying hahahah my insane ap history teacher insists on giving us like 15 pages of reading a night it so crazy and i mean that wouldntbe too bad if we didntalways have to outline the section and stuff but i trying and thank goodness the year is over blacksnowpetals hahaha i glad you liked it xxnightmaregoddessxx well you will find out hahahha wolf i sorry i sorry hahaha i hope to update a lot more now that summer is here so you wonthave to wait hey it was pointed out to me that draco asked to learn legilimency instead of occlumency well that was a tres silly mistake on my part because it was supposed to be occlumency but let just chalk it down to draco being uh nervous d chapter 16 jealous madame pomfrey shushed everyone that had crowded into the hospital wing which was a lot not only were blaise draco and i there but as much of the ravenclaw house that could fit in and some hufflepuffs too now miss chang will be quite all right she broke her collar bone but that can be easily fixed however she will be here until it completely healed which should be only two days or so she paused but it will be much longer if everyone stays in here and disturbs her so everyone get out now pomfrey ushered us out cho will be out in one day guarantee blaise said most likely i said relieved thank goodness she was okay the final score was ravenclaw 250 gryffindor 140 it had been an amazing game and had cho not taken such a dangerous drive they probably would ve lost we returned to our common room to find it the same as usual most slytherins hadntbeen too concerned when cho had gotten hurt gryffindor had lost it was obvious and that all they really cared about it was kind of sad really that each of the houses could never muster up enough compassion to really care about the welfare of anyone except those within their house but then again those who live in glass houses shouldntthrow stones i guess the next few days were rather monotonous nothing much happened except longbottom turning himself into a mandarin orange in transfiguration draco one of the first to notice wanted to keep him that way but mcgonagall wouldnthave any of that however something worth mentioning did happen soon after at least it worth mentioning for me i was walking into the great hall one day when i heard something that gave me one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life oh george that so amazing i heard i stopped george i looked over and saw indeed george standing there talking to a 7th year girl i squinted and hid myself from view feeling slightly ridiculous who was i to watch george each and every move george and the girl shared a laugh and i felt something in my stomach turn over my body tense and my lips form a slight frown what was wrong with me who was that girl more importantly why was i acting so strangely leanne i knew i had heard of her before she was friends with some girls on the gryffindor team once when draco had been saying something rude to katie bell that girl had been standing there so it made sense that she was talking to george i mean he and bell were both on the team and have the same friends i smiled i had no reason to be acting like this i didnteven know what i was feeling she had every right to joke around with george i stepped out and made my way the great hall once again i heard a giggle again and turned around i stared this leanne may be his friend but that certainly gives her no right to be that close to him i stalked into the great hall why was i so uppity about this i was being completely irrational i needed to talk to someone about this i looked around and saw cho she had just gotten out of the hospital wing about 2 days ago and i hadntgotten a chance to talk to her yet i smiled at her and waved her over to me she held up a finger because someone had stopped to talk to her she finished up with them and came over to me hey she said hi cho how are you i asked i had been worried about her she was pretty much my best female friend after all i feeling a lot better i glad we won the game at least that was the same kind of borderline psychotic feeling draco had for the game something i would never understand i glad but is a school quidditch game really worth physical injury i asked cho looked at me like i was mentally injured so i choose to keep my mouth closed on that subject cho i need your assistance with something i said walking out of the great hall oh sure what can i do she asked i turned and george and the girl were still there i grabbed cho arm and pulled her behind the wall adjacent to where they were standing look look at that i hissed what george leanne so cho asked i know that it exactly it doesntmatter right she nodded hesitantly but cho when i saw them like my stomach churned i felt like someone had just punched me and i just i dontknow why i admitted you re stomach hurt like someone was twisting it into knots she asked i nodded did you feel angry or upset i felt worried almost oh my god cho do you think i was having a heart attack i asked i had read once that heart attacks were a leading cause of death among muggles how embarrassing would it be to die from that lexi i dontthink you were having a heart attack cho grinned it looks to me like you re just jealous excuse me jealous i sputtered i dontthink so cho i dontget jealous ever please green may be my house color but i have never been a victim of the green eyed monster cho was being absolutely silly no lexi i serious you re jealous it natural dontworry but just dontlet it ruin things for you and george cho warned when i dated harry i was jealous of granger i raised an eyebrow why granger ugly and gross and barely a girl at all yeah but he paid a lot of attention to her and choose her over me and it made me think he liked her more than me and that hurt it does hurt i frowned as cho finished was i really jealous but cho that doesntmake any sense at all i whined george he wasntdoing anything cho nodded most of the time it doesn t or most of the time it the girl who is flirting with the guy well what do i do i thought maybe there was a potion or something i could take to get rid of this feeling uhm i really dontknow maybe just ignore it or keep telling yourself it nothing i pretty sure it goes away if you just trust that george wouldntdo anything cho said i looked down but i donttrust her cho i mean she is a gryffindor i complained so was george cho replied good point but george was barely a gryffindor at all basically only in name this girl however seemed to be the goody goody do anything to make herself look perfect type and she probably wouldntmind sinking low enough to steal george from me except she wouldntknow she was stealing george from me because next to no one knew we were dating damn i sighed but that what i wanted right and i guess i just have to deal with the ramifications thanks cho really i going to go back to the common room now though so i ll see you later i smiled at her quickly before walking away i definitely trusted george and i wasntgoing to forbid him from talking to this leanne character but really she seemed a might shady to me i would have to find out what her deal was and fast i mean there wasntreally any harm in just learning about her right right okay so tonight meet me in the potions dungeon at 7 you re helping me with you know draco grabbed my arm and whispered to me in the hallway i nodded i did promise after all so when george asked me if i wanted to come over to his office that night it took all i had to say no awe how come he asked god he was so cute well i kind of promised draco i would help him with something i said oh he replied blankly yeah i mean normally i would just cancel with him but this i promised a long time ago i would help him with this when he needed me and he asked me and i mean he is my best friend and i cantjust break a promise i made to him especially this what are you helping him with george asked i sighed i canttell you why george said narrowing his eyes a bit i didntknow what his problem was because it a secret i mean not to me it not about me but it about him and no one can know or someone else might find out and that s well no one can know except me i sorry you know if i could i would tell you but it isntmy secret i frowned i dontknow what you guys could be doing that so secretive george frowned back it was almost like he was angry or something what is that supposed to mean i asked nothing at all i just saying that you usually tell me things and the fact that you re keeping this from me makes me wonder george drifted off george i wish i could tell you but it really not about me i helping draco with something and he doesntwant anyone to know about it please dontbe upset i dontknow what i doing to upset you i said quietly i just i dontknow i dontfeel comfortable becuase you wonttell me what you re doing and it like you re hiding something from me george i am not hiding anything from you i just canttell you i really dontsee what the big deal is it just draco i shrugged yes it just draco draco who you re with practically every minute of the day and now you re going off for some secret rendezvous with him and i supposed to be just dandy with it he snapped i was quite shocked becuase george had never snapped at me he hadnteven been mean to me in any way since well everything in diagon alley but what was i supposed to do draco needed my help and george certainly wouldntunderstand i mean he was practically a member of the order himself and really since when has draco been a problem george since when do you have a problem with me being friends with draco i paused i mean he my best friend i dontknow what you want me to do i promised i d help him with this and i know he d be embarrassed if anyone found out so i going to have to stick to my promises i ll come find you later and hopefully you arentin such a horrible mood okay just go george was being quite irritable fine then i wontcome find you forget it you can come find me when you re not being an insufferable prick i turned and marched away why was he being such a prat about this i didntreally have time to think i had to help draco or at least figure out how to help him i hurried to the library looking for any books on occlumency finally finding one titled occlumency protecting your mind that one sounded like a winner to me i sat down at an obscure table and started to read the objective of becoming an occlumens is to prevent someone from reading one memories or emotions to do this much skill and concentration is required well draco had skill and the learner must learn to free himself from emotion emptying it as much as possible making it both blank and calm only then will the mind be harder to penetrate i skimmed the first chapter this should be easy for draco he was about as emotionally lacking as any individual i knew draco basically to everyone but me suppresses every bit of good he has in himself so all he got to do is suppress the bad too right i got up dusted myself off put the book in my bag and left i could really take the book out legally because i couldnttake a chance on crazy pince telling someone that lexi conrad was taking a book out on occlumency i hurried down to the dungeons seeing that whore leanne on the way and shooting her a very nasty look if george was mad at me for whatever reason i might as well make it worth my while hey drakey cakes i said as i entered he looked up thanks for coming he said he was sitting at desk reading a book that he must ve gotten from the library i got one too i placed the book next to him didntcheck it out right he seemed nervous very un draco of course not i replied sitting down next to him so explain to me draco what or more to the point whom it is that you re trying to hide your thoughts from he looked around the room no one here draco and i certainly not going to tell anyone i m i not trying to hide anything persay not anything important there are just some memories i have that i feel no one yes lexi no one has a right to know he answered his answer seemed almost too well put together for me i knew draco and i could almost always tell when he was lying or at least covering up the whole truth but i let it go i nodded that makes sense well let get started we both stood there for about a minute well i trailed you have to cast the spell draco paused because for me to learn occlumency it means someone has to perform legilimency on me which is why i wanted you to help i know it going to take some time and you re the only person i trust seeing my memories i smiled inwardly that actually meant a lot to me okay let get started it took a while for me to even get the spell right so we didn t practice with draco right away but eventually i got it however i wasnttoo good and it was only strong enough to see draco memories of today which were obviously at the forefront of his mind he tried to throw me off and successfully did so once or twice after about an hour he seemed pretty tired are you okay draco you want to be done for now no we have to do this he insisted draco you re exhausted you didntexpect to master this in one sitting did you drakey it going to take time and there nothing wrong with that we have all year i said calmly lexi i draco trailed off no come on we ll try again in a few days you can do this draco but you re not a god even you need a break i held out my hand and pulled him up from the chair he was sitting on let go get something to eat all right all you think about is eating draco joked i grinned what can i say i said sarcastically we headed down to the kitchens in silence slytherins are very stealthy especially when they are craving after supper snacks we got to the kitchens and ordered some of the chicken stew that had been served that night we ate in silence which i promptly decided to break well i think we accomplished a lot tonight i said draco made a sound in his throat i couldnttell if the sound was a positive or negative one what that supposed to mean i asked i dontspeak caveman drakey i dontknow i guess i just expected more maybe a bit unrealistic for me but i i really want to learn this by christmas draco said sweetie what are you trying to do fool the dark lord draco you should know better than anyone that that takes extraordinary magic far beyond even your power you re still a kid i paused what is it that you re trying to hide anyway nothing it not important we just have to do this lexi please dontask why he paused we donthave all year though that what you said earlier i have to meet him at christmas i only have until christmas well what makes you think that meeting is going to amount to anything but you saying hello i asked lexi stop being so naive you think i just going to have tea and biscuits with voldemort huh of course and while we re at it we can just watch dinner and a movie on the muggle tv right he snapped okay draco i sorry i just dontknow what you want me to do i trying i snapped back standing up i could understand him being upset but instead of taking it out on me he should just admit he scared of course draco would never do that stupid malfoy pride and arrogance and well the list goes on i turned to leave the kitchens lexi i heard from behind me i sighed and turned around what draco i just wanted to say thanks for you know helping me tonight he shifted uncomfortably i smiled slightly and walked over to him holding my hand out he took it and i pulled him up no problem drakey it what i here for the next day i saw george a few times but he didntseem too interested in me had we really had our first fight well first fight as a couple anyway the word couple still sounded weird in my mind we were a couple right of course we did couple things like bowling and dates and i always spent time with him so it understandable that i would become a bit concerned when he ignored me but of course i didntdo anything i told him to come to me and i was going to wait even if it killed me i made my way to the slytherin common room and i waited and waited and waited and after a while i got damned tired of waiting wasnthe supposed to come and apologize sometime soon i wasntgoing to wait here all day i mean for merlin sake i lexi conrad i made a loud frustrated growl and left the common room maybe it was just that he didntfeel comfortable coming into slytherin territory i went outside and sat near the lakes edge looking down every once in a while a grindylow would swim precariously close to the surface only to dive back down into the lake murky depths i sighed i kind of missed george i looked around and decided to go see if i could find him not so that i could talk to him so that he would have a chance to talk to me obviously i walked around the school aimlessly until lunch and then headed to the great hall as i was walking in i saw him he was walking alone i just wanted to run over and say hi but i couldntbring myself to do it he saw me and smiled i was about to return the gesture when george i ve been looking all over for you i felt a movement behind me as leanne ran up to george and threw her arms around him i sucked in some air and closed my eyes i wasnt going to hit her i wasntgoing to hit her i swear i wonthit her george looked at me over he shoulder i pursed my lips and walked away not bothering to acknowledge him i stormed over to my table sat down grabbed my fork and stabbed moodily at the salad on my plate i caught cho eye from across the hall and she raised an eyebrow at my behavior i mouthed leanne to her and she nodded sympathetically turning to watch george and leanne walk into the hall engaged in conversation i growled and turned away oh lexi growling someone in trouble blaise said grinning at me as he sat down who the poor soul that crossed your path forget it blaise it nothing i said my eyes still on george and leanne he followed my gaze he laughed ah so my little lexi is feeling a little threatened eh maybe a little jealous he teased not in the mood blaise i am not jealous especially not of some little gryffindor twit like her i responded mutilating a piece of lettuce as i stabbed it repeatedly blaise gingerly took the fork from my hand i dontthink you should be around sharp objects right now alexis i growled again this time turning to him now is really not the time to test me blaise well make him jealous back he said simply buttering a roll i paused make him jealous back on the one hand the logical part of my brain was screaming this is a horrible idea lexi you re only going to make things worse on the other hand the side of my brain purely concerned with my own feelings was saying lexi you better get him back for letting that little bitch put his arms around him and her too get her too problem is the side of my brain that was concerned with me was very irrational but that side always made a really good argument i pondered for a moment it wouldntreally do me any good to get back at either of them i decided george hahaha are you kidding did that really happen i heard from the teachers table leanne was leaning against the table still talking to george i felt something flare inside of me that girl was going down blaise was looking at me you know as far as scary goes you could give voldemort a run for his money sometimes when you get that manic glint in your eye i tore myself away from the sight of leanne the whore and said blaise i need to know about that girl any and everything that could possibly be turned into something embarrassing first crush first kiss any and all boyfriends did she have braces acne any embarrassing mishaps during her years here i need to know now lexi it usually you who has any embarrassing information on people blaise pointed out you re the one who makes the snarky remarks on the trio dammit good point but this leanne was never important enough for me before there has to be someone catty enough to have dirt on the girls in gryffindor i looked at blaise we were both thinking the same exact thing pansy i left the great hall throwing george a vicious glare as i walked by i needed to find pansy and fast i looked in our dorm she was sleeping probably due to a late night with one of her many interests pans pansy wake up now i shook her she sat up groggily what i need information on a girl 7th year gryffindor i said she blinked second drawer down of my desk it in alphabetical order by first name sorted by houses color coded i went to her second drawer and opened it i was actually pretty amazed by the amount of people pansy had information on i noted that slytherins were conspicuously absent however i didntbelieve for a minute pansy didnthave something on every one of us she probably just kept it hidden better i quickly thumbed through to the gryffindor section and took leanne folder it wasnttoo thin wasnttoo thick i took it and scurried over to my bed pulling the curtains and lighting my wand so i could see i opened the folder a n okay so there is basically no information about leanne that i could find such as her last name actual house or anything like that so i making it all up leanne pewson house gryffindor notable experiences first year had braces glasses picture enclosed snape embarrassed her by comparing her to a rabid beaver second year got rid of glasses third year teeth straightened lost braces went through phase of acne became known to slytherins in her year as pimply pewson fourth year dated ernie macmillan for 2 weeks sister died in car accident dated george weasley for 1 month fifth year allegedly had sex with marcus belby sixth year got detention for getting caught in the broom closet with kenneth towler and that was it i did a quick inventory of what would be best to use mentally making a note to not mock the death of her sister i not that heartless the fact that she had dated george previously didntescape me i told myself to remember to ask ginny about it later hey pans what are these stars for i asked pansy lifted her head slightly that stuff no one knows things that i got out of someone for something else i didntreally care what the something else was this was even better if no one knew about her shagging belby she would be mortified if i said anything now i just needed concrete proof lucky for me belby was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts which meant i could go straight to the source i tucked the folder under my bed and left planning to have a little conversation with mister marcus belby weeee yay okay so lexi is jealous even if she wontadmit it and george is stuck between his friend who he dated before and our little lexi leanne isntsome evil character though becuase of course she doesnteven know george has a girlfriend but anyway the next chapter lexi will well you ll see sorry you guys waited so long but i going to start typing the next chapter as soon as i post this one becuase i am on a roll byeee please review too ah so i forgot to thanks some reviewers from the last chapter because i didntsee their reviews in time i really sorry but thank you to bookworm2011 and buffyandspike 4ever thanks to the following reviewers on this chapter haha mavisclone ah i lovedddd writing that part and i thought i d just add in that she dated george to give lexi a bigger reason to be jealous hehe thanks so much captain speed o haaha leanne should be very scared you re right and thank you you are one of my favorite reviewers blacksnowpetals haha yeah if anyone would have info on everybody it would be pansy she definitely catty enough thank you assistanttotheregionalmanager who doenstlove george hahaha i know i do anyway thank you luckyyou thank you crea oh i love writing this i am determined to finish it haha thanks wolf well i certainly hope you dontcry but thank you so much lita awe thank you akira sama haahaa okay okay here you go and now onto the chapter chapter 17 lexi strikes back i set out to find marcus belby intending to get some first hand information on his alleged night of passion with leanne i figured he would either be outside with his friends in his common room or at the library there werenttoo many places to hide in hogwarts i checked the library first no sign of belby i wasnttoo sure as to the password of the ravenclaw common room so i decided to make that a last resort i headed outside and saw draco he waved me over what are you doing i haventseen you all day blaise said you were going demonic on him at breakfast what happened draco said patting the grass next to him i was not demonic someone just made me mad but i have it under control trust me i just need a bit more time i smiled draco looked curious what exactly he started but i cut him off i d love to tell you drakeykins but you always go off the deep end and never let me do things my way if i tell you who it is you ll go about your own way of getting them back for me which is sweet but it makes me look weak i smiled so you ll just have to find out with everyone else all right but for the record i am not sweet draco smirked i returned the gesture of course you aren t turns out marcus belby is extremely hard to find when i need him anyway so i had to wait until dinner to even see the bloke i sat there barely eating anything wanting to be ready when he got up to leave preferably alone to my luck marcus seemed to not have much of an appetite that night and left before most of his friends had even gotten to their second helpings i waited a beat and then followed him out of the hall i saw george look at me as i got up and hesitate like he was deciding whether or not to follow me i hoped he wouldn t now wasntthe time for him to try and explain his actions or hers luckily i followed marcus quickly into a hallway and george couldntfind me even if he had followed me belby i called he turned around his eyes widening slightly i wasntsure if he knew who i was or not conrad what do you want i grinned he did know me i decided direct confrontation would be the best way to get information marcus wasntstupid he wouldntfall for any of my bluffing seduction was out george may have been making me angry but that didntmean i was going to sink to leanne level so i decided to be open with marcus and give him a chance to tell me everything and if he didn t i would fill in the blanks myself please call me lexi i need to talk to you about something someone actually more specifically a 7th year scummy gryffindor you allegedly had sex with in your 5th year i believe i said smoothly he looked shocked to say the least then recognition registered into his face pansy he said ah yes what a shock to poor belby that pansy secrecy was about as reliable as cheating off of longbottom during an exam pansy exactly first off i would like to thank you for affirming that what she told me is indeed true second if i were you i would tell me exactly what happened because i going to use this no matter what but you might as well put a positive spin on it for yourself i said calmly let sit down marcus we ve been going to the same school for 6 years i think its about time we got better acquainted i opened the door to an empty classroom allowing him to go ahead he sat down on a desk and i sat on one a few feet away from him so he said so i replied why do you want to know about this he asked i pondered one of the persons involved in your rendezvous is of particular interest to me at this time i said leanne he said you re a sharp one i replied rather liking the back and forth nature of our conversation it showed he was open to talking to me at least why leanne why not i dontthink you re at liberty to know the intricacies of the situation i replied smiling slightly well what do you want me to tell you leanne is a whore she isn t to my knowledge sure she had sex with a few guys but hasnteveryone he shrugged leanne may be a bit flighty a bit flirty to be sure but she not a bad person everyone is a bad person belby some just let it out different ways than others i responded you mean by murdering muggles and other innocent civilians he snapped oh that stings it so original i canteven bear it now if you re done taking pot shots at my family background and house colors could you please name the people leanne has previously had let say more intimate relations with i brushed his insult aside he sighed it doesntreally matter if i tell you or not huh i grinned like the cheshire cat not for her however your fate in this matter isntset in stone give me something good enough and i might forget that you even knew leanne name i had him we both knew it all right i know she had something going on with anthony goldstein which everyone thought was really weird because he younger than her boring i said all right all right rumor has it zacharias smith was bragging about getting her in the sack he shuddered it made me rethink her standards mildly embarrassing true but bearable for her i talking over the top mortifying make her run home crying for her mother embarrassing belby donthold out on me i know you are i waved a finger at him okay okay this is the only other thing i know though i swear he paused debating whether he should tell me or not she wontknow it was you promise i said he nodded she was shagging terence higgs he said quietly what terence higgs the slytherin are you kidding me when the fuck did this happen and why the hell didnt i know about it i asked my eyes widened i had hit the proverbial jackpot look i only saw them once at night late i was coming in from a date in hogsmeade i passed the great hall and there they were on the table he paused i didnthave the heart to turn them in becuase i figured it took a lot for nerve for them to get it on there of all places i grinned bloody hell you wouldnthappen to know which table would you marky he smiled the staff table this was my lucky day i stood up to leave nice talking to you belby we should do it more often i was almost out the door when he cleared his throat nervously i smiled and turned around yes i said well i was wondering i mean you said if i told you he trailed off i smirked ah you want to know if your cooperation is going to be rewarded luckily for you belby i and honest slytherin for the most part if anyone finds out about you and leanne it wontbe from me he breathed a sigh of relief thanks i just dontfeel like getting pulled into anything i smiled i understand completely i left the room feeling that i had once again showed myself as slytherin manipulation at it finest now all that was left was to use this information to my advantage in the worst way possible well the worst way for leanne the best way for me i sat back and smiled so there it was it was finished and now all that was left was to sit and admire my handiwork as everyone found out about leanne tryst with higgs i stood up and stretched and headed out of my dorm i couldntwait until tomorrow i wasnttoo sure where any of my friends had gotten to so i started looking at all of our usual haunts it was pretty cold out so i was betting they werentoutside or at least i was putting off going out to check as long as possible i looked in the library checked the kitchens and finally went back to my dorm to put a coat on before i went outside i put my cloak on got my scarf and headed out to the courtyard there they were sitting on a bench all huddled together trying to look as sophisticated as possible losers hey idiots i called as i walked over to them hard to look suave and cool when you re freezing your asses off i sat down next to blaise draco scowled at me then why are you out here he asked i was lonely i grinned at him and now i cold why are we out here draco on a scouting mission blaise rolled his eyes pansy made a growling sound in the back of her throat oh gee who the lucky girl i asked sarcastically you d think girls would ve learned by now that draco didntcommit to anyone and they were basically just toys to him the blonde ravenclaw over there blaise pointed her out she was a typical pick for draco skinny stupid and completely lacking enough dignity to say no to him wow she looks like a great catch i drawled draco smirked no need to be jealous lexi please i yawned this is too boring do something or let go inside i freezing blaise nodded in agreement yeah draco why do you need us around to pick up a girl he asked slyly draco eyes narrowed i do not need you guys around i just thought you zabini would want to pick up a few pointers okay well if you dontneed us i ll be on our way i said getting up it was too cold for this draco is ridiculous i went inside and was greeted by a burst of warm air i sighed contentedly i hated being cold leila ran out of the shadows towards me and rubbed against my legs i picked her and held her for a moment before a voice stopped me oh my gosh is that your cat i turned and there she was the devil incarnate herself leanne obviously i answered my cool answer seemed to bounce off of her for she continued towards me she so cute i see her around all the time and i ve always wondered whose cat she was she adorable i always try to pet her but she always runs away she paused could i pet her now do you think i glared at her was she serious first my boyfriend now my cat this girl was trying to sap my identity i swear probably not i said icily turning around and walking away okay no need to be rude she called to my retreating back i looked over my shoulder i only polite to people who matter stupid bitch she would get what was coming to her i woke up early the next morning not wanting to miss my brilliant scheme going into action i got ready quickly and started to wake pansy up pansy come on breakfast i said shaking her i dontneed breakfast she moaned and rolled over you do today you do not want to miss this trust me get up i said she muttered some sort of agreement and i ran up to the boys dorm to wake draco and blaise guys wake up you guys have to be there when it happens come on i whined why what did you do blaise lifted his head he looked cute when his hair was all out of place i canttell you it will ruin the surprise but you guys will be so pleased with me i giggled i was so excited everyone was going to see what leanne was really like maybe she would cry i grinned at the thought and headed down to the common room to wait for everyone about 15 minutes later everyone was as ready as they were going to get varying degrees of sleepiness on their face i was wide awake and led everyone to the great hall merlin lexi what is this draco grumbled we have to be here for the owl post i said scanning the hall leanne was eating george and fred were talking animatedly with hagrid at the staff table dumbledore and all the other teachers were present perfect i buttered a piece of toast and filled my glass with orange juice what a lovely day right everyone i said cheerfully blaise draco and pansy all seemed more awake lexi tell us what you ve got planned pansy whined calm down you ll find out soon i paused and smirked as the owl post came in enough the owls flew about delivering their letter but one owl in particular was holing my attention and slowly gaining the attention of others not the owl perhaps but the red letter it held in it claws a few people pointed to it and it flew around the hall one more time before slowing down and finally stopping in front of its recipient lexi draco trailed off grinning blaise nudged me and smiled some people gasped and i smirked dumbledore reached out and opened the howler before him hello there albus a cheery voice but of course not mine boomed glad to see you open your mail anyway i thought i d let you and all of your other staff members know that you should check just how thoroughly your house elves clean your tables it been made apparent to me that some of your students have been doing some shall we say extracurricular activities on the staff table after hours there was a pause as many students gasped and broke out into giggles now who in your school would do such a thing what sort of person would defile another person eating place all in the name of having a good shag another pause draco was grinning blaise looked like he wanted to laugh and to my delight leanne face was getting paler with each word the howler spoke why none other than gryffindor own leanne pewson congratulations leanne because now everyone can know what a flithy whore you are another pause as all eyes turned to leanne she seemed petrified unable to move enough to even cover her face which was now a dashing shade of crimson but wait the voice called back gathering everyone attention once more there more just who did she engage in this little indiscretion with the voice laughed terrence higgs who you may remember graduated from the slytherin house only a year ago so much for house rivalry however as spectacular as leanne may think that one night was terrence said she was a loud noise escaped leanne throat as her housemates looked at her in disgust mediocre at best the howler then crumpled up burst into flames and settled on dumbledore plate i really dontremember who started laughing first i think it may have been blaise but soon laughter engulfed my table then hufflepuffs then ravenclaws finally even some of the gryffindors started to laugh i was grinning so draco laughed lexi i really didntthink it would be that good i mean you ve never done this to someone on your own before but now i just have to say you are bloody brilliant undoubtedly a fine fine job of embarrassing a gryffindor but why pewson blaise asked a smirk on his face because i could i answered coolly truth was i couldntreally explain to either of them why i was so angry at leanne they wouldntunderstand at all i looked at george he looked amused he looked over at me suddenly ugh he caught me staring at him he grinned and i raised my eyebrows and stood up leaving the hall before i left draco said later on we re going to have to rub this in pewson face if you want to finish the job properly oh of course i did i nodded of course draco i left the hall and before i had gotten as much as a few steps towards my dorm i felt a hand on my shoulder i turned around hey george said softly hi i replied it was so pathetic i hadnttalked to him for what two days and i missed him so much how re you george asked tucking a stand of hair behind my ear i smiled i missed you i said which wasntreally answering his question but i dontthink either of us cared here come with me he took my hand and led me up to his classroom which i guess was closer than his office i missed you too he closed the door i didntrealize i didntsay it back earlier that okay i smiled he looked down at me and gave me a hug i sorry for being a jerk to you the other day he said why were you mad i mean if i would ve known what was upsetting you i wouldnthave gotten so mad i said but i sorry too it just sometimes i see you and draco and i mean you guys are together all the time george paused are you sure there isntanything there my mouth dropped was george jealous oh no definitely not i said draco is like my annoying older brother who meddles in my life i laughed besides i know how he is with girls and i not stupid enough to even consider him as anything more than my best friend the thought is kind of gross i smiled george if i liked draco i wouldnteven bother dating you you know but i dontlike draco i like you you know that right yeah i do george grinned you look cute today i laughed i wearing my school uniform yeah but you still look cute i smiled he was so sweet i giggled george turned me into a mess some stupid giggly girl that couldntthink of anything smart to say back i always had something smart to say back i gave him a hug i should go classes are starting soon i paused can we do something tonight of course george kissed me okay that would be really nice how about i meet you at your office at 7ish i suggested and he nodded then i ll see you later love you love you too he replied grinning and hugging me one last time i turned to leave oh and lexi by the way george said i turned around he walked over to me and whispered in my ear leanne isntanything to worry about although it is flattering to what extent you would go to embarrass a girl so that i wouldntwant to talk to her anymore he kissed my cheek we re not even really friends she just likes to flirt is all but she wonthug me anymore i promise i was shocked i nodded and left as he shut the door to his classroom behind me i leaned against the door george weasley was much smarter than he let on i would have to remember this okayy so i hope you all liked this chapter and plus wow an update

hypocrite but i understand what you mean and you ll see that later in the chapter that he didntexactly agree with her but he didntwant to make a big deal about it because he and leanne really

kittylicious awe thank you so much george is adorable isnthe kajia wow i loved your long review okay well first george leanne thing okay well i wouldntsay george was especially pleased but i didntfeel i could have him be angry at lexi because i mean he george and he pranked hundreds of people so he isntin a position to judge her although this chapter goes into that but i glad you find lexi life realistic because i try to make is so and yes i too for some reason like george more than fred although i love them both and hopefully i can balance george being sweet and hilarious but i hope that wontbe a problem thanks for taking the time to review all that hahaha and now onto the chapter chapter 18 movies if i said i wasntexcited about my date with george i would be the biggest liar on the planet i was thrilled that he hadntseemed upset by what i did to leanne but i mean why would he she deserved it most definitely i ran to the dorm got my books and quickly headed to transfiguration i got in the door just in time and slipped into my seat grinning at mcgonagall she pursed her lips but said nothing to me diving directly into the lesson which wasnttoo interesting considering it was a note taking day draco this is super boring i whispered no really he answered from the corner of his mouth i rolled my eyes and turned to blaise pssssst i nudged him with my arm lexi i trying to take notes what he snapped okay never mind i ll just ask you after class is over i rolled my eyes again prats both of them class ended and we left quickly not wanting to be late for herbology well actually i wanted very much to be late for herbology since it was freezing out but we couldn t lexi what did you want earlier blaise asked as we opened the doors to the castle blaise didnttake herbology but he walked with us to the class anyway so i could talk to him oh well i wanted to know how things are with i lowered my voice cho blaise thought for a moment good of course i think i ll be asking her today we ll probably see her at some point i grinned indeed i hoped cho said yes she and blaise would be cute i felt blaise kind of needed a feminine force other than me in his life and cho needed a guy who didnthave his head up his own arse we got to herbology and found that today lesson would be easier than normal since the plants we were dealing with werentdeadly although the medicinal plants would jab you if you handled them too roughly ouch i dropped it i was handling it like a newborn these plants just dontlike me yeah who does draco asked smirking i slapped him on the arm lightly i hate you i paused so how are things going with miss what s her name i asked took her up to the astronomy tower last night draco sounded quite pleased with himself eeeewww i shuddered draco please donttalk about your conquests around me i know you re jealous draco patted my arm hardly more like disgusted becuase i guess i have standards unlike the little floozies you pick up i said sweetly he glared at me and i laughed kidding drakey kidding you re dashing of course he smiled oh i know we continued the conversation in a similar fashion until the end of class i had a break next as did draco but poor blaise had runes silly boy taking runes with granger i was excited about my date with george later and decided to go pick out my outfit i choose a cute emerald green skirt and a silver short sleeved shirt i owned a lot of green and silver i really needed to incorporate more color into my wardrobe i shook my head and left the dorm closing the curtains around my bed so no one would ask why my clothes were laid out i headed down to the common room where draco was waiting for me lunch he said i nodded i actually really hungry i said yeah well embarrassing someone like you did today depletes your energy i ll have you know draco smirked then my hunger is a small price to pay i smirked back we got to the great hall and i noticed leanne was conspicuously absent from the gryffindor table i grinned life was good blaise joined us for lunch and we discussed the hogsmeade visit before christmas and what we should get each other i want a castle i said draco rolled his eyes lex look at the house you re standing to inherit why cantyou be happy with that because castles are fun duh you re an idiot draco decided he decided this about 3 times a week no i not i quite smart you git blaise yawned of course you are lexi we all know that simmer down i laughed but seriously you two i dontknow what to get you shopping for girls is so easy just buy something pretty and i ll be happy and you guys need to help me get a present for george i whispered the last part what i wasntaware when i signed on to be your best friend that included helping with presents for your little boyfriend draco sputtered lexi if anyone sees me toting your shopping bags i will never live it down i grinned drakey everyone knows that you love me he smirked either that or they think we re having outrageous amounts of sex i snorted please spare me the agony of thinking about that blaise laughed really draco i dontthink lexi is your type he paused but dontworry we cantall be as charming as her prince charming i felt myself flush guys stop he nice and he doesntpick on you guys not a lot anyway of course not how could anyone pick on this perfection draco drawled blaise choked on his pumpkin juice i laughed slapping my hand loudly on the table we were drawing quite a lot of attention obviously blaise never does anything as unsophisticated as choking on pumpkin juice and i never do anything as heart warming as laughing our peers were quite surprised to them we almost seemed human for a second go figure well we canthave that now can we i stopped laughing patted blaise politely on the back a few times and we all regained our composure how embarrassing we left soon after and headed off to our first afternoon class together potions today in class we were brewing a difficult mixture called shaman solution which is supposed to if made corrected relieve one of any physical ailments for an hour however since we were only 6th year newt students it was unlikely ours would be powerful enough to last more than a few minutes and were therefore worthless fancy that so i was frustrated by the time class let out not only had i spent nearly two hours trying my hardest to brew this stupid potion which might i add needed to be heated up raising the temperature of the room quite a bit but after doing everything my book said to i get told that my efforts were futile anyway needless to say lexi conrad was not a happy camper we headed up the stairs into the entrance hall and i came face to face with a puffy eyed leanne sweet merlin not now draco and blaise looked at me expectantly i sighed and blew a piece of my hair out of my face well here we go an opportunity presents itself to torture leanne and i not even in a pleasant enough mood to enjoy it hey pewson i smirked she glanced at me leave me alone she sniffed i gasped what cantsay hello i paused you know i sure terry wouldntlike to hear that you re being so impolite that was something he always shall we say cherished in a girl stop she said a few people looked over curious i laughed mockingly you know if you would ve just said that to higgs at the time you wouldntbe in this mess i paused as i heard a few chuckles from nearby students so sad i really thought terry had better taste than you what your problem why are you doing this leanne cried out because i can i hissed and because i call things how i see them and when i look at you i see nothing but a worthless gryffinwhore that got a lot of laughs she replied snootily seems like you re just jealous i grinned oh yes i am extremely jealous that you were one of the thousands of tramps who got to experience terry manhood of lack thereof sweetie i dontneed to have sex with anything with a penis to feel secure i dontneed to throw myself at guys becuase i was born with the natural ability to know i worth something and you well you re not you re a worthless little girl who tries to use her femininity to make a name for herself but this isntexactly the name you had in mind is it pewson she opened her mouth to reply but i interrupted her but then again i guess any girl that would let zacharias smith between her legs doensthave much self respect anyway huh she looked shocked once again and whispers broke out in the crowd i grinned triumphantly and walked away i turned back after a few steps and called back to her oh and by the way leanne what she said miserably if you ever try to touch my cat again it will be the last thing you do i dontlike my things being dirtied if you have to touch her please wear a glove i walked away my mood brightened considerably all right boys off to charms it was 6 30 i had exactly half an hour to get for my date with george i was going insane i hurriedly put on my outfit and applied my makeup i had no idea what to do with my hair i considered asking pansy but as i thought of her horrid curls i figured anything i could come up with could be better than that i sighed and sat down now if i put my hair up my freckles would be more noticeable on my shoulders that was a definite no i looked at the clock and noticed it said 6 50 and deciding i didnthave time for any drastic changes i decided to stick to my regular straight hairstyle and i was ready to go i snuck downstairs and was almost out of the portrait hole when where are you going draco said from behind me i sighed where do you think dad i asked sarcastically really oh of course should ve known he smirked but then faltered well i was wondering if tomorrow we could uh you know he looked around the common room was full but no one seemed to be paying attention to us he walked over to me and said i was wondering if you could help me practice again tomorrow he looked at me hopefully i smiled and grasped his hand for a minute of course draco thanks he let out a breath anytime and i left i walked quietly and as stealthily as possible to george office and knocked on the door george answered quickly i looked him up and down quickly he looked cute as always wearing jeans and a long sleeved blue shirt that brought out the blue in his eyes which were gorgeous by the way hi i said smiling he let me in hey he grinned goofily i smiled hesistantly what you look beautiful i felt myself blush and wished i wouldn t i wasntused to anyone but draco saying i was pretty and even then i was pretty sure he was only saying that becuase he was my best friend thanks i hugged him you look cute should i have said handsome i wasntexactly sure george smiled i have a surprise he held out his hand and i took it george always surprised me i grinned i really excited george led me out of his office i didntwant to risk trying to sneak you to hogmeade so we re going to have to use the room of requirement if i remember correctly you re familiar with it he smirked you could say that i laced my fingers in his he looked at me are you sure he asked i mean sure everyone was at dinner by now but anyone could come down the hallway but for some reason that night i didntcare yes i said and he smiled slipping his arm around my waist it felt nice we reached the hallway where the room of requirement was and he stopped turning to face me he said now lexi since you ve been so deprived i feel it my duty to teach you all of the quaint little things muggles have adopted to amuse themselves without having the magic we do i laughed my teacher exactly so tonight i taking you to the movies and with that he opened the door and led me inside and i had no clue what to expect a large box was on one side of the wall the box well it was more of a rectangle was mostly black but one side was covered in a smooth glass a few feet away from it facing the glass side was a large squishy couch that you could recline on another side of the wall was apparently where the food was although it wasntfood i was familiar with a glass case stood in one spot filled with little yellowish puffballs what are movies i asked it kind of hard to explain they re like stories that muggles watch on this a tv he pointed to the big black rectangle with the glass side they re stories that other muggles have made and filmed so you can watch them over and over i squinted what like a pensieve he laughed sort of except you arentin the story and it doesntnecessarily have to be a memory he replied i shrugged okay i guess this could be okay he grinned and told me to sit down i sat down on the edge of the couch while i watched him hit a button and then stick something into the tv and he came over and sat down d you want some popcorn he asked popcorn i scrunched my nose well i dontknow what that is but i dontlike corn very much so i probably wontlike it if it popping all over me he laughed it doesntpop all over you duh he went and got some and came over to me here try it i smiled and took a few pieces of popcorn and put them in my mouth there was a strong butter and salt flavor and something else i couldntplace that i assumed was the popcorn itself in any case it was good this is good i exclaimed george smiled fondly at me i smiled back so the movie is called mortal kombat not exactly sure what it about but it sounds like a good fighting movie george said happily a n okay mortal kombat came out in 1995 and this takes place in what 96 97 right i didntwant it to be too recent and it was either that or clueless p or se7en which might not have been bad but i didntwant to use a brad pitt movie even though i love him anyway righto the movie started out and within a half an hour we discovered it was indeed what george called an action movie there was a lot of action and i ll admit most of it was pretty cool basically it was about these 3 martial arts masters get summoned to this island to compete with other martial arts master from another world or something and whoever wins gets control of the earth whatever i didntreally follow the plot because about 20 minutes into the movie george yawned and put his arm around me i grinned was he trying to be subtle i smiled up at him he smiled back and kissed my forehead i wrapped my arms around his waist and we sat there like that for a while enjoying the movie hey george said suddenly hmm i mumbled i wanted to talk to you about something i heard george said sitting up i straightened and looked at him curiously okay what well today i heard that you kind of instigated with leanne george said now i just don t think that was nice or necessary oh i paused you seemed okay with it before well i dontknow i mean i not exactly one to judge people for pranking am i he laughed i cantfault someone for a good prank even if it was a bit mean well duh of course it was mean george i mean what did you expect well she shouldnthave i started but he cut me off i know i know lexi but i mean you cantgo attacking every girl who talks to me george said it kind of the same thing as you and draco right you just have to trust me well i trust you but i donttrust her not for a minute i glad he squeezed my hand so you had a problem with what i did i asked well i was a little disappointed i guess that you couldntkeep your emotions in check and i dontthink leanne is as bad as you think but if you dontlike her that fine what of course leanne is as bad as i think she a no good low down dirty scummy the list goes on i narrowed my eyes and george laughed dontlook at me like that lexi i didntsee what was so funny but george why didntyou just say if you didntthink it was okay and i mean she she deserved it i mean if it hadntbeen me it would ve been someone else and they probably couldnthave pulled it off as well as me so she should be grateful that she was embarrassed in such a brilliant fashion i argued and you prank people all the time so i dontknow why you care and you said you werenteven friends with her i was breathing heavily george frowned a bit and took my hands in his lexi it okay i dontcare about leanne at all i care about you and that why i was concerned when i heard about it i mean lexi i know you and i know you arentlike that he brushed a stand of hair out of my face and gently ran his hand down my cheek making me shiver i i am though i paused not to you though or anyone else i care about he pulled me close i guess i just wish you wouldntbe so cold to everyone else becuase then everyone could see how amazing you really are i not i dontwant i have everything and everyone i need i paused i dontthink anyone else is worth getting to know especially not her he smiled sadly okay it your choice you re disappointed again arentyou i whispered for some reason the thought of disappointing george made me more upset with myself than i was with him he smiled no i love you just the way you are i love you too you know i said kissing him on the cheek he tilted my head up and kissed me i put my hands around his neck and pulled him closer and suddenly i wasnttoo worried anymore about leanne and her flirting i had missed that a lot more than i would ever admit to anyone after the movie was over george and i stayed there just lounging on the couch together he had stretched out on the couch and i was next to him my head resting on his chest i felt like i could fall asleep i think he already had george i asked turning so i could see his face he was indeed asleep he looked adorable and so peaceful and happy that i didntreally want to wake him but i didntwant to leave him either so i did what any sensible girl would do i grabbed a blanket got into a more comfortable position and kissed george on the cheek not really thinking about the consequences of falling asleep as i was drifting off i felt george slip and arm around my waist and pull me closer to him i smiled into his chest and felt him kiss my forehead love you george i murmured love you too lexi yay hahaha i felt like doing a fluffy chapter i hope you guys liked it and i hope you all review as much as you have been lately i ve really appreciated it much love everyone and to anyone who hasntread dh get to it haha hey there everyone although i could now with the release of hbp make this story follow the book i still want to keep it au since not everything could match up by the way i not positive if hogwarts students are only allowed one pet but since owls are not technically pet like i dontthink it would do much harm to have an owl and another pet sorry if that bugs anyone thanks to the following reviwer s glad you liked it enjoy ch 2 of for good disclaimer i sadly do not own anything in the harry potter world except for lexi conrad her cat leila and her crazy loon mother which trust me is nothing to brag about except for leila she the coolest cat ever chapter 2 dented pride owls and arses i myself dontknow even to this day why i had a continued interest in george weasley i loathed him but something about him was so strange interesting i couldnthelp but bump into him again hey lexi george hollered as he and i assuming fred since they looked exactly alike ran into their shop i smiled and waved draco quickly narrowed his eyes what was that about he asked i grinned what was what all about he shook his head you know what i mean stop being evasive why was weasley heying you i tossed my head you find it so hard to believe that someone would want to hey me no i find it hard to believe that you would want weasley to hey you draco responded we ran into each other literally he helped me pick up my stuff i couldntnot be polite and he introduced himself i explained leaving out the part about our conversation i sure you could ve been impolite draco grumbled i laughed that your problem you dontconsider how useful people can be you let your arrogance shine right through while i keep mine hidden you re almost as bad as and over emotional hufflepuff draco sputtered and what use has weasley been may i ask i grinned well i ll tell you but only if you promise not to say anything i want to use this information in a very specific way malfoy honor draco promised first of all malfoy have no honor i chuckled at draco angry face kidding there you go again cantyou ever detach yourself isntthat what slytherins pride themselves on draco rolled his eyes sorry i not an ice queen like you i glared at him now whats the big secret i leaned in close to draco turns out my friend that our dear gryffindor keeper has a very cute nickname ickle ronniekins i smiled i suppose the twins use it to tease him with and with that boy it undoubtedly makes him very embarrassed well it hasn t yet i smirked and draco looked like christmas had come early now say golly lexi you were right and i suppose as my way of apologizing i ll never ditch you to hang out with those dunderheads crabbe and goyle again i said sweetly draco grinned no such luck darn worth a try as a matter of fact crabbe and goyle saw no reason why they shouldntsome back over to the alley tomorrow draco walked ahead of me oh no no draco no no no no no i caught him by his arm and turned him to face me i refuse to be anywhere near them no tell them to stay home in fact let send a fake hogwarts owl telling them they failed their classes and that they shouldntbother coming back next year i nodded that would certainly brighten up everyone year lexi why dontyou like them draco shook his head do i need a reason i said coolly i donttolerate stupidity then why do you put up with yourself draco asked a smirk on his face i quickly smacked him lightly in the head dontdo that i said angrily do what draco asked innocently you know what stop being evasive i mimicked you re trying to change the subject by teasing me not going to work draco lowered his voice and leaned in towards me freckles he whispered poking my shoulder he then sped off arghhh draco malfoy i growled angrily chasing after him needless to say i wasnthappy with young mister malfoy for the next day the dundering duo came plowing through the leaky cauldron grunting as much as before obviously the summer did nothing to improve their speech i glared at draco before walking into the alleyway after using my wand to taps the correct bricks i walked quickly down the street wanting to put as much distance between myself and draco crabbe and goyle as possible stupid never listens to me ew wish they d have just failed in first year jerks stupid idiotic morons i muttered and even worse thoughts were going through my head never ever going to talk to him again i stated although i knew it wasnttrue draco and i always talked but it made me feel much better to believe it at the time ouch sorry i said bumping into someone i shook my head and saw none other than hermione granger we glared at each other for a moment she obviously hadntforgotten the broom closet comments i hadntforgot the detention i had gotten for it either alphabetizing flitwick charms books i swear he has a million of them i tossed my head and looked away right guess i sorry too she said grudgingly i laughed no you aren t and if there anything i hate more than a prissy self righteous gryffindor it a liar i turned and walked away oh yeah she said to my retreating back well if there something i hate more than a slytherin it s one who cantlet go of a grudge she faltered i turned back to her and scoffed so very witty is that all i really expected better from you i mean you re just so darn perfect arentyou i said scathingly hermione laughed do i detect a hint of jealousy i smirked you wish you did but just to clarify no i unlike you dontneed constant praise to know i unique i unlike you do not need to strive to be so perfect nor do i want it i replied coldly i dontneed constant praise dontassume things about me hermione said angrily i laughed remind me why we re still talking i paused isntron waiting for you in a broom closet somewhere i laughed and walked away although i could almost feel granger anger coming towards me in waves oh well better expect another round of detentions when i return to hogwarts i continued down the alley muttering about not only crabbe and goyle but granger as well going to have detention coming out the kazoo never would ve happened if they hadntcome should go jump off the astronomy tower the lot of them talking to yourself first sign of insanity george had snuck up behind me i giggled giggled and replied they say there a fine line between genius and insanity george grinned walking alongside me i was never aware you crossed onto the genius side of said line i grinned and hit him lightly on the arm well i do so nah nah nah i stuck my tongue out at him i think that why i liked being around george so much i could be myself or my un self i could be stupid and act like a goof and he wouldntthink me any the worse for it but boy if my mother found out i was shooting the breeze with a weasley i would never see the outdoors again alexis victoria the weasley are good for nothing penniless blood traitors who have no respect for their heritage i got a speech about every family in the wizarding world drilled into my head the malfoy s there a good family pureblood simply delightful people glad to see you re with the right crowd the parkinson arentquite so influential but they do have bloodlines tracing back almost as early as ours i approve the bones are simply horrid no respect for blood that what it boils down to alexis victioria remember that the goyles pureblooded but empty headed still better than hanging around with mudbloods the blacks oh simply a marvelous family too bad the eldest one sirius turned out so wayward brought the family great shame being sorted to gryffindor was stupid enough to choose the wrong side then get framed pity they re dieing out oh yes and plenty more he laughed and his eyes sparkled as he said you re coming to my shop i dontthink you ve seen it yet uhm well sure but only for a moment i agreed the shop was much nicer than i expected pranking items lined the shelves and a long counter was in the back of the store with the cash register across from it against the wall so see anything you like george led me around the store i picked up various pranking candies such as canary creams some skiving snackboxes and other items steering clear of any explosives i heard a bell jingle signaling someone either entering or leaving the store fred george where are you ron weasley voice yelled i froze weasley that meant potter and granger were there as well it was like a law wherever one was the other two were close by i here coming george yelled back then turning to me he muttered it always fred and george never george and fred i ll never know why he then grabbed my elbow and led me to back of the store hey george clapped harry and ron on the back hermione glared at me in shock i grinned at her george ron said what she doing here george raised his eyebrows that lexi he grinned at me she cool dontworry knocked her over the other day accident of course hermione coughed rather loudly i frowned at her george she said quietly but firmly she a slytherin a slytherin what the bloody hell does that mean oh you re a slytherin so you re bad like that settles the matter like now i some diseased little urchin which one shouldntcome into contact with what rude little wankers george looked at me in a confused way lexi you arenta slytherin are you his voice sounded hopeful i wanted to say yes and have him say it was no problem but it was a problem with him the same way it would be a problem with my mother yes i am i was unaware that was a problem i answered my voice a bit cool well now you are aware so you can go hermione pressed granger will you shut up what is it with you why do you always get into conversations that have nothing to do with you i asked glaring at her you re a slytherin i have every right to not like you you hate people like me she exclaimed her face getting red you re right i do hate you but not for the reasons you think that would give you such a simple reason for hating me no i hate you because you re a stuffy stuck up prissy self righteous insufferable little know it all who may i add gives many unwarranted detentions to innocent people i said coldly you were out past curfew she said hotly i had a meeting with professor snape about an essay but did you believe me no did you even ask him no because hermione granger the perfect prefect never needs to ask anyone if she doing anything right because she always right isntshe i finished scathingly then added or did you give me detention because of a few comments i made about you a broom closet and a certain person who shall go unnamed out of the sheer goodness of my heart granger glared at me as well as weasley and potter george just looked a bit disappointed i sighed but then again you gryffindors are sickeningly self righteous and not even because you want to be we arentso different gryffindors and slytherins ambition cunning cleverness and a certain degree of arrogance i wontdeny it courage also though you all tend to get blinded by your love of playing the hero potter flinched at these words slytherins will always save our own necks granger scoffed which is a nice way of saying you ve got no sense of loyalty i rolled my eyes it not a lack of loyalty dear it a lack of trust we dontthrow ourselves in front of the ax for someone else because we doubt they d do it for us you though you are like little lambs jumping to get at the slaughter i paused but the only reason you re so good is because you re scared scared of what weasley ron asked angrily you re good because you re scared that if you the least bit bad even once that you ll get addicted to it i finished smiling smugly at them like you and your friends potter asked we arentaddicted to darkness it the only place we re welcome but i ve never done anything horridly bad i can honestly say i ve never used an unforgivable i whispered staring at potter i saw the color drain from his face of course when your parents are and are friends with death eaters news travels quickly of course i knew about sirius dying and about potter using crucio on bella i ve got to say i never thought the boy who lived but developed serious mental issues had it in him that something to brag about i heard granger say sarcastically from my left i smiled coldly still staring at potter you d be surprised granger boy would you be surprised i paused and walked to the counter may i have my items rang up now i thought there was a no slytherin policy here weasley said quite rudely if you ask me george glanced at me i looked away there i was all by myself and he couldntsay one word in my defense i was disgusted in him he was everything i had been told a weasley was and a lot more and there was no way i would apologize for being a slytherin sorry miss but you re going to have to leave george said looking away miss what is he a house elf no problem cantstay here much longer anyway i can feel my intelligence depleting from all of the idiocy in this room i said icily i walked towards the door accidentally dropping everything i had been planning on buying i then stepped on every little thing i could then turned to face where they were standing i saw four angry faces two of them had very red ears i shrugged giggled a bit and said oops before walking out the door so drakey wakey you re going to go shopping with me today i exclaimed no get weasley to go get more dirt from him he muttered eating his breakfast of bacon and eggs with toast and a glass of orange juice i took a sip of his juice before responding i can t i said in a high pitched sing song voice bugger wonthave anything to do with me no more found out i was a good for nothing low down born rotten bad to the funny bone slytherin draco head shot up he snubbed you you got the brush off by a weasley he said outraged nothing more than a peck at my pride i lied i was a bit upset actually i liked being around george and find it disgusting that his opinions about people are so shallow and easily swayed hmmm well we ll get him back enough through his brother no one slights lexi draco grinned glad you think so now you have to go shopping with me i smirked arrghhh be ready in 20 or i ll drag you to every store even if you re naked i dontthink draco has ever gotten ready faster so what are you getting draco asked casually i want an owl let go sooner we get done sooner we go back it just isnthere they re all wrong i exclaimed just pick one already we must ve looked at 50 owls by now there it is i pointed to one on the counter it was pitch black with 3 grey silver striped running from above it misty silver eyes over it head to the base of the neck on each wing there were also 3 grey silver stripes ma am how much is this owl i asked the witch at the counter sorry dearie it already been bought and paid for are you sure there isntanother one they can have i pleaded sorry no the witch moved along the counter i narrowed my eyes fine let go draco we ll take our business elsewhere i stormed out draco following and amused expression on his face and what praytell is so funny i asked angrily draco grinned when you get mad you dontget flushed but you re freckles get darker i hit him in the head enough about my freckles they are not to be used as a source of amusement and should in fact be regarded with respect i tried to look dignified but one look from draco and we were both laughing let go to quality quidditch we arrived at the leaky cauldron half an hour later and found both our parents waiting for us alexis victoria my mother swooped down on my my father never one for the dramatics nodded at me in acknowledgement we have come to have dinner with you mrs malfoy explained i never called any of my parent friends by their first names because it was a sign of disrespect and deeply impolite we sat down to a delicious meal of turkey potatoes and various vegetables but i most ate turkey potatoes and gravy draco alexis mr malfoy started we will be unable to take you to the station this year we all have urgent business that needs tending to yes father draco said of course mr malfoy i piped in but we will give you this my mother held up one of her necklaces a portkey to get you to the station it will activate 20 minutes before the train leaves giving you plenty of time to find a compartment so make sure you re ready yes mother no need to worry i said putting on the necklace so i wouldntmisplace it well now that that is taken care of before we go we have some back to school gifts for you if we can proceed to your rooms mr malfoy stood and we all followed suit we went first into draco room where there was a box inside was a book titled wizarding bloodlines and underneath that a set of highly familiar robes at the end of the year my son lucius put a hand on his sons shoulders i stopped myself from gasping draco had his robes everything seemed so final for him now i looked at him his face was a mixture of excitement and uncertainty he wasntready i realized i wasnteither nevertheless i went and gave draco a hug offering my congratulations now i know you ll be disappointed dear but you ll have to wait until you graduate for yours my mother said looking at me with sympathy i tried to muster up a look of sadness well let go to your room now my father said and we did i opened my door wondering what would be there if not robes and on my bed in a cage i saw the exact same owl i had been trying to buy earlier oh mother father thank you i exclaimed softly it beautiful heh you should ve seen her she tried to buy that today i thought she was going to clobber the storekeeper when she said no but instead she just turned and walked out the door draco said chuckling selene that her name selene i whispered giving my parents each a hug selene hooted happily as i opened the door of her cage she gracefully flew herself to the top of my wardrobe glad you like it dear my mother said hugging me again well we must be getting off until christmas then draco alexis mr malfoy nodded to each of us in turn mrs malfoy gave draco a hug be good draco she said and she and mr malfoy left the room have a good year lexi my father gave me a brief one armed hug alexis victoria see that you dontcause much trouble and do keep up with your studies i ll be expecting you at christmas my mother reminded me yes mother i will i said because i had a name to uphold another reason i couldntbe seen fraternizing with a weasley so i said sitting on my bed about 10 minutes had passed since our parents had left draco was currently sitting in an armchair on the adjacent wall to my bed so he said avoiding my gaze i dontthink you should take those to hogwarts you dontneed to get caught with them i said slowly dumbledore is bound to have dark detectors set up i ll transfigure it into something else then how would i get it home before we leave he asked just no you re not taking them you dontneed to get kicked out of school for that i glared at him for what you dontthink dontyou think this is the right thing his eyes widened i i dontknow i just i just know that i want to stay alive i finished and you re so young draco i looked at him he was too young what could he help why must it happen now surely voldemort could wait until draco graduates draco stood and walked over to me sitting down next to me he put his arms around me dontworry about me lexi i always manage he said soothingly it isntfair you shouldntbe expected to do this you arenteven of age yet i sniffled it ll be okay he continued to say i looked up at him do you think you can do it i asked softly do what kill someone a mother a baby a little girl or boy who have done nothing except be themselves i whispered i i highly doubt that i ll have to kill someone as one of my early assignments he said more to himself than me i lowered my eyes he couldntdo it but he had to or he would die i then wondered what i would do faced with becoming a murderer or causing my own death i would do anything to stay alive but would i really kill someone would it be worth living if i had the constant guilt of ending an innocent person life that was when i started questioning one of what i thought was a unbreakable belief that nothing nothing could be worse than dying and that nothing or no one was worth dying for draco hurry we ll be late you ll miss the portkey then i ll get in trouble for not getting your lazy butt to hogwarts i yelled through his door just minute i lost my badge he said back well when i was done using it i put it back where i found it i said sarcastically hardy har very funny how much time do we have draco asked 5 minutes tick tock meet me in my room what why cantwe leave from my room i heard him sigh angrily because silly i dontwant to carry my trunk you re the big manly man quidditch player you haul your over to my room i answered the door opened fine let go and get ready bloody portkey s nothing but a pain in the arse then you have something in common with it i teased i am not a pain in anyone arse he protested except mine i pointed out and opened my door well frankly my dear i dontgive a damn about your arse i gasped i know you ve said on more than one occasion draco that my arse is simply smashing yes but i meant it smashes everything you sit on draco said but before i could reply e both felt the familiar tug of a portkey taking both us and our luggage to platform 9 3 4 i am not talking to you i hissed grabbing my trunk cat carrier and owl lexi i heard my name being squealed pansy it so good to see you draco been a complete prat all day i said giving her a hug let go find seats then draco and i have to go to the prefect meeting pansy took leila cat carrier from me and we boarded the train so how was it i really hoped you guys liked it just so you all know draco and lexi arentreally romantically interested in each other they re more

lemonxxx hahah thank you for taking the time to review the crimson wings awe thank you so much i glad you like it and now onto the chapter chapter 19 field trips invitations and conversations i rolled over in my sleep but in mid roll i was stopped by a large mass what the hell i moved my hands up and felt a body next to me and at that point i realized that i was completely entangled in a mess that included myself a blanket and george weasley i blinked for a moment wondering how george had gotten into my dorm before remembering that i wasntin my dorm i was in the room of requirement i looked at george george i said he slowly opened his eyes do you want to wake up now i looked outside it was still relatively dark i checked my watch and it was 3 26 in the morning george yawned not particularly but i think this couch isntexactly big enough for us to both sleep comfortably i agreed although it was nice to be so close to him as though the room heard our conversation the couch molded itself into a bed well george laughed nervously that convenient i smiled also nervously and laid down more comfortably next to him i really should go back to my dorm i argued with myself but it not as though george was trying to seduce me or anything and besides i couldntleave him there alone and anyway i was really tired so i stayed lexi george whispered to me pulling me closer to him yes george i answered back in a similar tone although i dontknow why we were whispering no one was there to hear us i was pressed against george and for as much room as the bed gave us we didntseem to be using any of it i didntfeel awkward though with george it felt okay to be that close to him you dontfeel pressured to be here right he asked tilting my head up so i could look him in the eye he looked worried i kissed him lightly of course not it s i trailed off really nice actually he smiled yeah it is let get some sleep and sleep we did when i awoke the sun was shining outside shining much to brightly for it to be 6 am the time i normally get up for classes i looked at my watch 9 30 shit dammit i cursed silently george wake up i shook him huh he opened his eyes sleepily pausing for a moment to admire how cute he looked i shook my head and continued it 9 30 we overslept you have classes george looked guiltily at me i so sorry lexi it okay this was so much better than being in a boring class i smiled at him he grinned really really he wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close well what do you have next i thought for a minute well right now i missing charms and next i have a break a break really george grinned mischievously i giggled yes that what i said so exactly how eager are you to leave do you really want to go to charms he leaned down and kissed my neck softly i gasped well i mean not real i uhm i stopped and took in a large breath i not a big fan of charms actually well isntthat lucky george murmured his mouth moving up from my neck slowly i shivered quite i said before kissing him oh boy i stumbled out of the room of requirement about an hour later george walked calmly out after me how was he always so clam when i was so flustered i was the slytherin being cool and collected was my forte see you later today he kissed me quickly on the cheek bye i called after him wait later today of course i had marketing today i raced down to my dorm and sped into the common room i was almost to my dorm when i heard a voice nice of you to grace us with your presence lexi draco snapped shit double shit draco i d completely forgotten listen drakey i sor i was cut off sorry do you have any idea how worried we ve been blaise and i where have you been he grabbed my arm and sat me down draco i have to get ready cantthis wait why should it wait you seem to have no problem skiving off for your precious boyfriend draco paused then continued much more calmly if you were planning on spending the night with him you should ve told us i wasntplanning on it it was kind of an accident we were watching a movie muggle thing i said at draco look of confusion and we kind of just fell asleep i really sorry draco i had no idea we d slept this late draco sighed and ran his hand through his blond hair i guess it was an accident he stopped then said sharply he didntdo anything did he oh no i said quickly we were just sleeping that all all right he said i told the teachers you were sick i gave him a hug thank you i so sorry were you really worried he nodded we didntknow if someone had found you and gone to a teacher we thougth maybe someone had contacted your parents or something my parents i hadntthought about them in a long time they would be furious if they found out i shuddered no thank merlin i going to go get ready will you wait for me we had lunch next i had missed defense charms and my break in the afternoon i had a break and then marketing yeah i guess draco smirked boy are you lucky you have a friend like me i rolled my eyes heading to the dorm as i got to the stairs i ran into blaise he saw me and his eyes narrowed lexi where have you he started but i quickly ran to my dorm sorry blaise talk to draco about it i have to get ready i slammed the door before he could start yelling at me too i showered quickly dried my hair and put on my uniform in record time i ran down the stairs before realizing that i had forgotten my bag i quickly ran to get it again okay guys i m an empty common room greeted me ready prats apparently they were still a bit miffed at me i walked to the great hall and spotted my two friends sitting together waiting for me you guys are really nice you know that i said sitting down in between them draco smirked well we werentsure if you d be coming down or if you were still tired from your night of passion i flushed it was not a night of passion you arse shut up i punched him in the arm lightly blaise chuckled your weasley seems to find your reaction pretty funny too he said as i turned to glare at him i glanced up at george who was smiling at me with an amused expression on his face i grinned back and turned to my meal anyway what did i miss this morning i asked well defense was boring as hell no homework though we just read next class we re doing a practical lesson though blaise said i smiled should be fun and charms was all right we reviewed cheering charms draco paused then smirked although i sure you got something much better than a cheering charm huh lex i choked on my pumpkin juice draco malfoy i couldnthelp but laugh though most likely because he was right george was much more effective than even the best cheering charm we finished our lunch and headed off to marketing we were the first people in class and as soon as cho came in she ran over to me so what happened she whispered excitedly what do you mean i asked come off it i not daft neither you or george was at breakfast today she paused and blaise said he hadntseen you since yesterday now spill the beans lexi grinning i told her about my night after i was done she did the characteristic girly awe that so sweet she paused and he didnteven try to make you she trailed off no not at all and i was really impressed with that i said as the class began to fill up i would be too that must mean he really cares about you a lot he serious cho said smiling i paused before smiling back how serious did i want george and i to be i mean obviously we werentgoing to be married not with my parents and his most likely standing in the way and my parents can be very persuasive especially with voldemort on their side but if voldemort were gone your parents wouldntbe able to hold that over your head you could do whatever you want and be with whoever you want and no one would tell you what to do a voice said in my head well yes i reasoned i guess that true but they re still my parents not very good ones i d say the voice replied all right so they arentideal but what am i supposed to do let them disown me how would living on the streets make me any happier i sure george has a nice apartment somewhere or something this voice was really starting to bother me i had to stop myself from snorting with laughter why would i live with george why not you ve already fallen asleep with him and you claim to love him isntthat what people who love each other do it not that crazy i felt like banging my head off a desk yes of course people do that but most people dontdo that when they re 16 soon to be 17 and their parents are death eaters now do they you re being ridiculous the voice said in a drawl that sounded an awful lot like draco ugh shut up draco i said aloud he turned to me i didnteven say anything he exclaimed i bit my lower lip embarrassed it was a pre emptive shut up i just trying to get it out of the way you know i smiled he rolled his eyes you know eye rolling is very feminine you might want to watch that i said just as fred and george came in i glanced at george and caught him staring at me i smiled and looked away hoping that i wasntblushing you re blushing cho whispered to me darn this field trip today class fred announced bugger what good does a field trip to when we arentmissing any classes weasley said from across the room well if it bothers you so much weasel just stay here draco smirked well ron actually we re going to tour our shop first then spend the night at the leaky cauldron before touring the ministry department of business and industry tomorrow george said so you will be you whiney prat everyone got a good chuckle out of this a n i dontknow if that the real name of the department but oh well i dontthink a department like that has ever been mentioned so everyone pair up with someone of the same sex please george and i dontwant to get in trouble because of your hormones fred said cho i said immediately she nodded i looked at blaise and draco expectantly you two are pairing up right they nodded lazily i was excited to get out of hogwarts until i thought of something wait did he say we were going to visit the business department i said slowly cho shook her head it makes sense it a marketing class after all she paused what wrong i sighed and blew a piece of hair out of my face my father is the head of the department of business and industry i laid my head down on the desk draco patted me on the should and leaned down to whisper something in my ear be careful tomorrow lex you dontwant daddy finding out about georgie pie i closed my eyes can i just not go somehow possibly i tugged at a strand of my hair fred had been walking around answering question and he stopped why dontyou want to go lexi afraid george and i arentthe most reliable teachers he plastered a wounded look on his face not exactly i managed a smile lexi here doesntwant to get the third degree from papa conrad blaise smirked she never was as good of a liar as me hey i said offended i can lie with the best of them your dad works at the ministry fred raised an eyebrow surely you know that draco asked he the head of the department we re visiting a light bulb seemed to go off in fred mind oh yeah i guess so he frowned well this certainly he trailed off but no one needed him to finish anyway i sighed maybe i can pull this off i paused right right cho said supportively i smiled at her well i guess if you donttalk to him much you could draco said we ll keep you hidden i rolled my eyes which unlike draco was okay for me to do since i was a girl i guess besides he department head i doubt he ll spend much time on us kids anyway i reasoned fred grinned so you re going i sighed dramatically i guess so blaise smirked this should be fun okay guys george called go get some stuff whatever you want and meet back here in 20 minutes hey this will be just like a sleepover someone called i rolled my eyes except it wontbe idiots i went to my room packed some clothes that were decent looking enough for the ministry as well as comfortable pajamas and a blanket and hurried downstairs to meet draco and blaise we got to the classroom before anyone else so i said expectantly as we were sitting there fred and george were sitting up front blaise and draco next to me no one responded well draco i ve decided you re carrying my bag i smiled he sat up quickly your ass i am fred and george laughed from up front get blaise to blaise can t i whined blaise grinned he going to carry cho of course he frowned say what he said we all started at him never say that again please i said quickly let all pretend that never happened right george said indubitably fred agreed oh weasley draco said suddenly i quirked an eyebrow and gave him a warning glance oh lexi stop it i not going to yell at him really i just wanted to let him know that if he plans on anymore late nights with you that he should please let us know since i know you arentresponsible enough to i narrowed me eyes draco malfoy first of all you are not my father i started to go on but fred cut me off but we ll be seeing him soon so no worries lexi george paled what lexi father is head of the department of business and industry blaise chirped george raised his eyebrows well uh that interesting george said nervously oh the elder conrad is nothing to be scared of draco waved a hand yeah well you arentdating his daughter drakey cho said as she walked in i tried to smile at george dontworry my dad doesntnotice much about me anyway it was true my dad wasntexactly a loving father he wasnthorrible either though well george started it true weasley it safe to say mrs conrad wears the pants in that relationship draco said i laughed draco donttalk about my parents like that it not nice we stopped talking as the other students began to come in i ran my hand through my hair okay guys we re all here we re going to floo from dumbledore office but fred and i will take you up there in groups of six so it doesntget too crowded okay george explained so we quickly emptied the room until it was just me cho draco blaise fred and george well we should go i said turning to leave george walked over and picked up my bag here i ll get this he said smiling at me i grinned back thanks i said softly i walked beside him at the back of the group blaise and cho in front of us and draco and fred looking rather awkward at the front what do you think i should do about my dad i asked i didntwant george to think i was embarrassed of him or anything but really i wasntexactly eager to introduce george to my father because my father could be very scary sometimes i well i would love it if he would accept me with open arms but i doubt that will happen he laughed but lexi as long as i with you i dontcare and if that means hiding our relationship from your dad then that fine with me i squeezed his hand thank you i said smiling at him he smiled back anytime love we got to diagon alley and quickly checked into the leaky cauldron which was surprising to me since i didntknow they had that many rooms cho and i had a rather nice room nicer than the one i had during the summer at least probably since the bed had no loose spring we put the few thing we had brought away and hurried downstairs to meet george fred and everyone else to go to the shop after warning us that anyone wandering off would be given detention we were led to the shop i grinned slightly as i remembered the last time i d been there obviously granger remembered too for as soon as we walked into the twin store she muttered to me try not to break anything conrad i was about to say something when cho stepped in the only thing that i can think of that lexi would want to break are those ugly heels you must think are fashionable granger why dontyou go somewhere where your conversation is actually wanted i beamed at cho before shooting granger a very dirty look the twins gave us a tour of the shop quickly explaining how the setup of the store was more appealing to the eye and such to be perfectly honest i wasntplanning on going into a business like this when i graduated so i only paid a bit of attention mainly to the parts when george was speaking after the tour the twins said we could explore the alley warning that anyone who left the alley would go back to hogwarts immediately and be prohibited from any more field trips and we ll know too george warned before everyone dispersed everybody but me that is so is the shop open today i asked george smiled no i grinned so i can stay here then if you d like just then cho ran back into the shop lexi she squealed launching herself at me did you know the whole time i was quite confused cho i know many things what are you talking about i asked george laughed blaise just asked me out cho said excitedly i gasped that bloody prat i ve been telling him for weeks weeks and he finally gets the courage to ask you out and does it when i not around i ll kill him i will i stopped in the middle of my rant wait i paused what did you say to him yes cho said happily i squealed and hugged her and we did this odd hopping about that sort of resembled an african tribal dance tell me everything i said i turned around and george looked quite startled at my reaction i laughed uhm george would you like to hear about this i asked he shrugged i ll wait out here for you lexi you and cho can go talk in the workshop he pointed to a door behind him i kissed him and cho and i went to the back okay well we were all walking out of the shop except you obviously and blaise said he wanted to talk to me i was like well okay blaise because we always talk you know so anyway he takes me over to this little i dontknow alcove then he like cho i ve liked you for a while now and i was wondering if you d like to you know date and of course i was like oh merlin yes because i mean really it blaise and he always just so nice to me nicer than harry ever was and i really like him a lot and i just cho trailed off i glad he likes me too i hugged her he does like you a lot i happy for you well i just wanted to tell you but i have to go we re spending the day together cho squealed again personally i was appalled with myself for doing so once okay i ll see you later can you send george back here i asked she nodded before leaving i sat there for a moment pondering before george pranced in like oh my good golly gosh he said in a shrill voice can you believe it ohhhh he tried his best at a girlish squeal i laughed and rolled my eyes i ll have you know i am thoroughly ashamed with myself i ve had enough squealing for a lifetime he laughed and put his arms around me you re cute when you do your girl thing he grinned i laughed and laid my head on his chest i dontdo it often i kissed him quickly he picked me up and set me down on the desk i had been sitting at lexi he trailed off his ears turning slightly pink i was wondering if you know during break hmm i nodded telling him to go on well y see i thought that maybe you would like to just for a day or two mind you come and visit during christmas and he paused meet my mum i sucked in a breath my eyes wide i had heard stories about molly weasley and she was not a woman to have on your bad side george actually under normal circumstances that sounds rather pleasant but i tilted my head i rather terrified of your mother he laughed loudly my mum lexi you re not scared of anybody i mean my mother is nothing to be afraid of well of course not for you but look who i am the name alexis conrad normally doesntinspire warm fuzzy feelings in the hearts of a young man mother i would imagine i know exactly who you are you re lexi conrad and i love you sure you re sort of mean sometimes but you re also sweet and amazing and the only girl who has ever made me this happy and trust me my mum will be grateful to any girl who could put up with me or fred george grinned i made george that happy really i hugged him tightly i m i ll think about it i would have to find a way to get out of my house and i trailed off well just let me know i d really love to see you you know i felt his hands moving slowly up and down my back it felt really relaxing actually i d love to see you too i smiled up at him you have the prettiest smile out of anyone i ve ever met he said suddenly i smiled and looked down thanks i paused i love you george grinned i love you too we should head back to the leaky cauldron he said as i was leaving i saw draco sitting on a bench apparently waiting for me come on let go find blaise and cho i said grabbing his arm we looked around for a while before finally finding them inside the leaky cauldron having a butterbeer we sat down with them isntthis just darling draco drawled i smiled draco it is be quiet i reprimanded blaise grinned at me i heard you were mad when you heard i had asked cho out without you being present he said and i nodded well maybe you would ve been if you hadntbeen of with that dashing ginger of yours i smiled well when you put it that way i trailed off obviously i preferred george company to seeing blaise ask cho out if i had to choose cho and i eventually headed up to our room we sat down and i decided to ask her what she thought about my relationship with george what kind of relationship would you say george and i have i asked she thought for a moment well he obviously cares about you more than he would if you were just some random fling cho said thoughtfully i nodded yeah i guess but like what am i supposed to do this summer should i keep dating him over the summer do i want to keep dating him i paused i mean i just dontknow what i want or what i expected to want i guess lexi you shouldntjust base your decisions off of what you re expected to do cho said you re worried about your parents she didntask it was more like a statement well yes i mean it one thing for me to be dating george in the safe confines of hogwarts but during the summer i mean or even over break what am i supposed to tell my parents oh hey mom and dad i dating a weasley oh i know you always go on about how i shouldnthang around any of them and so of course i dating one while keeping in complete compliance with your wishes i sure that d go over well i sighed and ran a hand through my hair your parents cantrun your life forever cho said soothingly but they can cho i dontknow how but they can i just i cantdo anything on my own everything i do depends on them because i already so far gone that i donthave any i paused i donteven know what i trying to say it like i ve already gone along with them on so much how am i supposed to come back from that if i donthave them i donthave anything they re my parents and i know they should accept me unconditionally but they don t they wouldnti mean cho patted me on the back how much do you want to be with george she asked i closed my eyes that the problem right now i want to be with him enough that i might stand up to my parents but what i saying is what if i think our relationship is something it isn t what if i overestimating how much he cares for me and we end up breaking up after i ve stood up to my parents where does that leave me i flopped down on my bed this is insane and kind of ironic i always thought i would end up marrying someone my parents picked out for me i never thought i d have this type of situation to deal with lexi cho said a bit timidly i think you re being a bit selfish i gaped at her no i mean it just in everything you last said it was me me me you know she paused sure maybe you and george might not last forever but what you have now is making you happy right i nodded and i know you like to know things lexi but when it comes to relationships you cantcategorize your feelings or the type of relationship you re in you kind of just have to go with it as annoying as that is i nodded she was right ugh and really even if you guys dontget married and live happily ever after in a little cottage with a white picket fence i snorted at this wouldntit be good to finally be your own person and step out of your parents shadow they re going to be gone someday lexi i dontmean to sound morbid but you cantjust live your life for them i dontknow i clenched and unclenched my hands i canttell my dad tomorrow i just can t george said he didntmind you donthave to lexi no one will blame you cho said softly i ll blame me it not fair to him it not i wish i werentsuch a i trailed off for all those time i had made fun of gryffindors and their stupid courage i honestly wished i had some of it now george invited me to meet his parents over the holidays i said quietly cho gasped ohmigod really that great she stopped are you going i sighed cho was right i needed to stop living in my parents shadow and start doing things for myself doing things i wanted to and even if i couldntmuster up the nerve to tell my father about george the least i could do is show george i cared enough about him to stop blindly following my parents wishes yes i going i said finally smiling as cho jumped on my bed and we started talking about what it might be like to meet the formidable mrs weasley the next day i woke up bright and early and showered quickly before cho awoke i decided to wear a pair of professional black dress robes ones my mother had bought me to wear when my father had business guests over and since they were okay to wear when he had business guests i assumed they were okay to wear when going to a business workplace i headed downstairs and saw george sitting there alone in a booth secluded in the back of the leaky cauldron i went and ordered my breakfast pancakes and pumpkin juice of course and sat across from him you look nice he smiled i laughed i figured that i better or i would be hearing about it in the next letter i get from home i shifted uncomfortably george smiled and quickly squeezed my hand which had been on the table before returning to his breakfast george i said softly he looked up yeah he quirked an eyebrow and it made me smile i well i d like to come visit you during christmas i paused then continued quickly but only if you still want me too and only if it convenient for you and your mum and only if you make absolutely sure it all right with her first and will you please let her know that i in slytherin beforehand becuase i mean i dontwant her to be surprised like you and i trailed off and george asked amused and i rambling i never ramble i sorry i apologized in all actuality i never used to ramble but i d been doing it a lot lately dontbe it was adorable george smiled and i would love for you to come and so would mum i know she knows i seeing someone fred isntexactly the most secretive person in the world in case you haventguessed i laughed wow really i said sarcastically i smiled at george well i glad and i m excited really but i have to go wake cho up so i ll see you later love you i kissed him quickly on the cheek and left i woke cho up and waited as she got ready draco and blaise found us soon after and we headed downstairs together where most students already started to gather we all flooed to the ministry much in the same way that we had flooed to diagon alley i stood close to draco blaise and cho not wanting to be left by myself we all crammed into an elevator which incidentally was not fun we finally got to the department of business and industry and were greeted by a tall dark haired man with a smug look on his face and eyes that bared a striking resemblance to my own daddy dearest right he said gruffly my father was never one to use silky and dramatic tones like draco father he always got straight to the point you lot are the marketing class from hogwarts he raised and eyebrow george and fred at the front of the class nodded he eyed them appraisingly hm yes well i suppose you ll do he turned and walked and only i knew that he meant for us to follow so i did when the only people to follow me were draco and blaise i turned around well come on i said shortly everyone followed my father gave us a tour of the offices explaining that if anyone planned on having a career in this department not likely i thought they would need good marks overall and need to take a business course as regulated by the ministry upon your graduation how exciting it was almost too good to be true as we neared his office everything had gone on without a hitch he hadntsaid anything mortifying at all and i was almost in the clear almost we got to his office and he turned around looking us over well i d rather not let a bunch of rowdy teens into my office he said simply which wasnttoo bad until he added especially with you two at the head of this group looking pointedly at the twins i closed my eyes why couldntmy father keep the comments to a minimum if only for me i mean he must know that people will realize he is my father and ugh sir i assure you we are the epitome of responsible when teaching fred said giving my father a winning smile which won him nothing but a snort of disbelief right cantbelieve dumbledore gave this job to a dodgy lot like you didnteven graduate hogwarts my father was muttering rather loudly mind under his breath i rolled my eyes george was my boyfriend i couldntlet him be talked to like this i pushed my way to the front of the group ignoring draco protests my father was still mumbling and i sidled up to the left of him discreetly father i hissed he looked over lexi he raised his eyebrows see i ve always liked my father much better than my mother becuase although he never took much of an interest in my life ever he called me lexi not alexis what are you doing i looked around most of the class had dispersed and were looking at flyers on the walls and such you canttalk to them like that they re my teachers my father narrowed his eyes at me lexi dontyou take that tone with me he started but i cut him off i sorry father really but i just dontwant to have to go back to school and answer questions about why my father picked a fight with some teachers i said then had an inspiration i mean you wouldntwant me to have to have a private chat with dumbledore right and you always say he d like an excuse to talk to me or draco alone and he could use this as my father eyes widened in realization he realized i was right i incredibly sorry he said quickly to the twins quickly although anyone listening could tell he wasn t i have a giant workload today and this whole thing had kept me on quite the tight schedule he paused i d like a private word with my daughter though before you lot leave george and fred had no choice but to nod and my father grabbed me by the elbow and led me into his office he shut the door i shyly said hi daddy and smiled he looked over at me sit down lexi i did so now as you probably know draco is going to have a very important meeting over the holiday break i nodded and he continued however beneficial your mother may thing it is for you to meet him as well i dontagree my eyes widened what i said my father sighed lexi you re 16 you have your whole life ahead of you and you ll eventually meet him and become what is expected of you i flinched but he didntseem to notice and i just dontthink its a good idea to have children meeting lord voldemort then going back to hogwarts where they are constantly under dumbledore nose i agree not just becuase of that but the thought of meeting voldemort made me want to wet myself so your mother and i as you already knew are not going to be home so you can stay at hogwarts for christmas or go with draco but while lord voldemort is there you are not to be am i understood my father stood up signifying the end of the conversation yes father i said good now if you cantfind a way to get away during those days owl me and i ll think of something he clapped me on the back you d better get back to school if anyone asks we were discussing our summer vacation to bermuda okay i ll see you sometime i shrugged your mother and i will be home for the new year ball i trust you ve already bought something i nodded good girl i smiled as i left the office fred and george were waiting for me a short distance away what was that about fred asked oh you know summer vacation plans my dad wanted to run a few things by me i said nonchalantly i knew neither of them bought it but they were obviously smart enough not to press it most of the students had already flooed back to the leaky cauldron to get their belongings and fred followed them cho came up to me grinning i was impressed with the way you stopped your father from verbally abusing george here i looked at the floor george smiled as we both stepped into the fire place everyone got their belongings and we all returned to hogwarts in time for lunch george tugged lightly on my shirt and i stopped waiting until the hallway cleared out hmm i asked leaning into him he kissed my lightly cho wasntthe only one who noticed that you know he grinned and it didntgo unappreciated good to know i smiled but it wasnta big deal dontbe modest your dad would scare the bejesus out of anyone george smiled down at me i love you a lot you know thanks i love you too and you re welcome i smiled back maybe i had stood up to my father more than i thought and maybe stepping out of the mold my parents had made for me wouldntbe such a struggle i thought hopefully looking back i now realize that thinking that proved i had a lot to learn about my family and i would start to learn soon and fast chyeah foreshadowing hahahah anyway wow long chapter i hope you all like it read review please

when thinking of george call it a false sense of security however one thing i did dread was my meeting with the infamous molly weasley george repeatedly told me i had nothing to worry about to which i responded that i actually had everything to worry about should i get her a present i asked without waiting for an answer i should get her a present wait does that mean i need to get your dad one too i dontknow what to get him he likes muggles right i definitely dontown anything even remotely muggle i paused wait but what should i get your mum i growled in frustration that cute when you do that george looked up from his desk where he d been doing work of some sort i tried to smile but it turned into a grimace i am so nervous i never nervous i laid down on george couch and looked over at him why arentyou nervous because i ve been yelled at by her about as many times as humanly possible i kind of numb to it and plus i an adult george grinned she canttell me what to do i was quite sure molly weasley was the type who could tell her children what to do no matter what age they were so when are you coming over again george asked well my father said i paused i mean i staying with draco because my parents wontbe home and for a few days i have to find somewhere else to be so maybe before christmas sometime like the 23rd george nodded sounds good to me he smiled i sure mum will love you psh about as much as snape loves potter you know i have to go shopping this hogsmeade weekend i grinned what kind of present do you want george came over and laid next to me putting his arm around me you donthave to get me i cut him off now dontsay that i donthave to get you anything and that i a present enough becuase that a load of rubbish it christmas and everyone deserves a present so you re getting one i kissed him on the cheek he grinned well what do you want he asked me i thought i dontknow i think it cuter if you decide what to get me i said he sighed i horrible at buying gifts i laughed and kissed him quickly i have faith in you i paused i should get going curfew is soon george grinned mischievously you could always stay here he said his hands lightly brushing over my stomach it sort of tickled but mostly it just made it hard for me to breath properly tempting i managed to say but not tonight i smirked and kissed him planning to pull away quickly george it seemed had other ideas we finally broke apart wow he breathed i nodded i love you i said leaning into his chest and closing my eyes i love you too i take it you want to stay then he asked kissing my forehead softly i want to but i really should get back i said my eyes still closed george grinned well then let get you back he lifted me up i laughed and protested george what will everyone think in case you haventnoticed lexi i ve never been one to care too much about what others think george laughed and opened his door i groaned and resigned myself to just enjoying the ride we got a few odd stares from people who saw us but by that time most people were in their common rooms anyway and george used the secret passageways of hogwarts that he knows like the back of his hand so we didntrun into many people at all and certainly not anyone that mattered he set me down in front of the entrance to my common room and i gave him a hug i have to go to the shop this weekend he said so i wontsee you again until monday at the earliest i frowned how unfair oh well i guess by the time you get back i ll have your christmas present i grinned at him but i ll miss you yeah i might miss you too he smirked but kissed me nonetheless and then it happened miss conrad you re cutting it rather close to curfew snape said from behind me although he didntsay anything about the fact that i had been kissing george there was a dangerous quality in his voice that let me know it hadntgone unnoticed i turned around biting my lower lip george held my hand s sorry professor i ll try and be i paused more careful next time snape eyes flickered to george and he made a tutting sound my office miss conrad professor weasley he said this rather sardonically you re quite the distance from your chambers arentyou george nodded silently squeezed my hand and answered right you are severus george attempted a smile i ll be going to bed now night lexi professor he walked slowly snape put a hand on my shoulder and steered me to his office uh oh so snape said evenly i frowned look professor i sorry and i know what you re going to say and i know it s it not the most intelligent thing for me to do i know i paused i had no idea what to say and snape said silkily and i dontexactly want to talk to you about my relationships professor i sighed please donttell my parents snape stood up miss conrad i have always felt you were an admirable student you exemplify everything a slytherin could be and more you are cunning sly intelligent and quick witted he paused however all of your potential seems to be lost any common sense you have is gone now apparently at the hands of this weasley twin he took in a breath i am sure you re aware of how much trouble you would be in if you got caught and i shocked that you as a slytherin were so careless when dealing with your relationship he almost spat the last word out professor i know and i swear i ll be more careful but i dontfeel you should tell my parents i paused i mean what they dontknow wonthurt them right i shifted my feet nervously and thought i saw snape features soften miss conrad i he trailed off i dontadvocate what you re doing with the weasley boy not at all i cantsee it ending well for either of you he paused but i have no control over you and as you didn t break curfew there nothing i can do all i can do is give you the strong suggestion that you re evaluate your priorities and your relationships in particular he strode over to the door i nodded thank you professor i said my head bowed slightly i didntwant to see the look on his face snape may not have been my favorite person but he always looked out for his house members and i appreciated that about him i walked silently back to my common room whispering the password and going directly to my dorm ignoring draco and blaise when they called me over to where they were sitting i needed sleep desperately i woke up early the next morning and realizing it was a saturday didntmuch care what i wore i had more important things on my mind so i threw on an old sweater i had taken from draco ages ago which was much too large on me but very comfortable i grabbed my homework and walked grumpily down to the common room and sat down on a couch pulling out my charms book to read up on what i had missed i had worked on my homework for nearly two hours before i was interrupted nice sweater draco said sitting down next to me i smiled and looked up at him your clothes are so much more comfortable than mine you know i said moving a piece of parchment off of my transfiguration book can you check my charms essay for me sure as soon as you tell me why you so blatantly ignored blaise and i last night he said smirking at me i sighed snape saw us draco gaped at me you were that careless he asked i grimaced i know i feel like such an idiot it was mortifying i mean of all the teachers snape isntexactly the one i d choose to talk over any personal information with i put my head in my hands what did he say draco voice softened significantly i lifted my head up he said i needed to reexamine my priorities said he d always considered me a true slytherin until this and that he cantsee it ending well for either of us i said quietly he said i allowed my judgment to be clouded basically that my common sense went right out the window draco patted my back awkwardly well it it could ve been worse right he said uncertainly i sighed i guess so i mean of course it could ve been george could probably be sacked and i sure if he were involved with anyone other than a slytherin snape would ve demanded it i paused and i dontunderstand why snape isntgoing to tell my parents i dontget it they re well not friends but they share a rather strong common bond maybe he just doesntwant to start trouble i mean we all know the reaction wouldntbe pretty draco said thoughtfully i can look over your essay now if you d like he smiled down at me i managed a half smile thanks drakey nothing went on saturday i finished my homework and discussed the after holiday quidditch season with draco after ravenclaw beat gryffindor slytherin demolished hufflepuff which isntmuch to brag about and gryffindor did the same the next match would be gryffindor vs slytherin right after holidays i thought our chances against gryffindor were good draco had been working the team vigorously and even if draco couldntcatch the snitch i thought that we should at least be able to score enough points that it would even out in the end and give us a fair chance at the championship sunday was a hogsmeade weekend and i was going with draco blaise cho and pansy since george wasntthere blaise and cho were the picture of happiness although they attracted a few odd looks as they held hands but they obviously didntcare and i was happy cho had deserved this for so long and so had blaise draco and blaise left after a while to presumably go buy us all presents although they adamantly denied that was the reason for them leaving i grinned at cho as they walked away time to shop for our little boyfriends i said and added as an afterthought oh and draco too pansy groaned i have no idea what to get draco she said helplessly i grinned come on you guys we re all smart girls we have to be able to buy decent presents for our boys we ll help each other now come on and we trudged off through the snow to find the perfect presents for well everyone how about these pansy held up a pair of silver silk boxers draco would like these right i snorted draco would be mortified if he thought pansy was thinking about him in nothing but boxers i smiled he d love them they look really comfortable i said with cho nodding in agreement so pansy bought them i grinned fabulous i decided to get draco a watch i found one with magical properties that could protect it user from most basic jinxes it would probably come in handy i thought grimly i found blaise a good book on animagus blaise was weirdly interested in reading a lot he seemed kind of like granger in that aspect i shuddered and reminded myself to never make that comparison again cho frowned lexi do you have any ideas as to what i should get blaise i hummed thoughtfully let go to we were standing on the main street of hogsmeade i stopped puzzled what would blaise like i wasnttoo sure cho laughed i should get him something from zonko s as kind of a gag present and of course i d get him a real one too she trailed off maybe a picture of us i smiled i sure he d love it we walked to zonko and cho got an assortment of joke items then we went to a small trinket store to look for a picture frame and i decided to look for something for george cho and i perused the shelves looking for anything of interest when something caught my yes after reading the instructions and deciding it would be perfect for george i bought it cho choose a silver elegant wire frame we headed to the three broomsticks then to meet draco and blaise becuase i had decided not to get cho or pansy their presents from hogsmeade and was probably going to use a wizarding catalogue we walked in and immediately saw draco and blaise sitting at a table in the corner blaise smiled slightly and nodded draco smirked and we went over madam rosmerta brought us each a butterbeer and i smiled in thanks so ladies draco said hmm i sipped my butterbeer what d you get us then blaise asked grinning i gasped what oh guys i i trailed off wow this is embarrassing and awkward i uh well didntget you anything i said and for a moment draco and blaise looked rather put out before realizing that i was joking and what did you lads get your best friend lexi i asked leaning over slightly to try and see into draco shopping bags he quickly obstructed my view now lex what fun would it be if i told you now he drawled i smiled none i guess we talked for a bit longer before deciding to head back up to the castle draco grabbed my arm as we went inside saying can we practice now most people are still at hogsmeade no one will miss us i nodded and we went into an empty dungeon okay draco said i ve been practicing clearing my mind and i think i should at least be able to make it more difficult for you to get into my mind i laughed lightly that is as long as i ve gotten better at the spell you know draco whoever you re trying to hide your memories from is bound to be much more powerful than me i know but it has to help right draco said i shrugged and we got started it turns out i wa s a bit more used to doing the spell but draco had gotten much better at throwing me off i didntee much until near the end of the night legilimens i said and suddenly i found myself at the malfoy estate draco come here i heard lucius snap draco followed him into his study yes father draco replied respectfully but bored he was wearing elegant dress robes but nothing compared to lucius normal set of robes you were quite an embarrassment to your mother and i tonight at our dinner party couldnteven think of a thing to say when it was brought up that the mudblood granger surpasses you in all your subjects lucius took in a breath and draco interrupted except potions he said and lucius narrowed his eyes only becuase snape lets you slide by he paused and what have i told you about interrupting me dontdisrespect your elders draco especially not your father he took a step towards draco and draco cringed slightly lucius reached for his cane before i could see anything else i was transported to another memory and how much will this get draco was standing in an alley in hogsmeade his hood up a man stood next to him examining a sterling silver spoon fork and knife respectively ya say this is genuine silver he asked gruffly looking around for any eavesdroppers draco made an impatient noise in the back of his throat of course would you expect any less from my family look at the crest you twit draco said snappishly a right well i can give ya roughly the man trailed off 300 galleons fer this draco thought for a moment then nodded i ll take it the man handed him a sack presumably filled with coins and they parted i suddenly felt myself pulled from draco mind and i looked up to see a pale draco you all right i asked breathing heavily not becuase i was tired physically but more from what i ad seen draco looked a bit flushed i okay he said i went over to him and sat down it appeared he d been knocked to the floor i sorry i said putting my arm around him for what he said but leaned his head against my shoulder nonetheless everything i saw your lucius i said quietly he nodded i used to it you dontbelieve him do you that you re inadequate i paused you re not draco you re brilliant thank lexi he gave me a small smile i sighed why are you pawning off your family heirlooms draco i paused i worried for you you dontneed money i know you don t you parents give you money whenever you need it unless i looked over at him sharply unless what he tried to sound indifferent what are you doing i asked why do you need money that your parents cantknow you have he shrugged what can i say i dontwant my parents to know i enjoy buying the occasional dirty magazine he joked i laughed but turned serious again really draco dontget in over your head i warned and he nodded i won t you promise i said as we stood up to leave the dungeon ever the gentleman he held the door open to me as he said i swear hmmmm okay a bit shorter than the last one but still good i hope review and tell me what you think next chapter should be them all leaving for christmas okay there

what you mean but lexidraco certainly wouldntwork later on but of course i the only one who knows that hahah thank you so much though for the input chapter 21 meeting molly i sat on my trunk and draco closed it with a snap thanks drakey i said sweetly i dontknow why you need all this junk anyway it only the holidays he said irritably truth be told i usually donttake a lot of clothes home with me but i still hadntdecided what to wear to meet mrs weasley so i took more clothes than usual to keep my options open a girl can never have too many clothes i said pinching his cheek he grunted and moved his face out of my reach we went up to the great hall to have breakfast before sitting down i ran over to cho so you know the plan right i asked quietly you re coming to my house on the 22nd and staying until christmas eve morning right she asked i nodded but everyone knew i d really be going to george s right i told my parents that and they re okay but they ll be away so you shouldnthear from them if you do tell them i in the shower and contact me at the weasley right away i said all right and you know if you need anything you can stop by my house she said grinning have fun be a good girl you know the rest i ll be sending your present to draco s i grinned see you when we get back i gave her an awkward one armed hug and went to eat i looked up at the staff table and smiled nervously at george he gave me a reassuring grin i didnteat much mostly becuase i was terrified that my parents were going to pop out from behind a suit of armor as soon as i left the great hall and drag me home having learned about george and i thankfully the suits of armor werentoccupied by anything other than dust bunnies draco blaise and i carried our trunks up to the entrance hall where the students congregated waiting to be taken to hogsmeade to catch the train home we filed out into the carriages and rode to the train station blaise and i hurried to get a good compartment while draco pansy and cho went to the prefects meeting a n it never said whether cho was a prefect or not i d assume she is but i may be wrong if i am sorry blaise and i played a game of exploding snap to pass the time in which i infinitely came off worse and had to eventually pull my hair back to prevent the ends from getting singed i had just finished winning my first game when the other three came in blaise i believe i just kicked your arse i said smiling smugly blaise let out a snort of laughter oh yes after i ve beaten you what twelve times or thirteen he grinned fourteen actually but i wasntabout to let him know that instead i crossed my arms and snuck my nose in the air everyone knows it the last game that counts blaise who said this was the last game he asked me at this point the door opened and draco came in followed by cho and pansy cho sat down next to blaise of course and draco took the seat next to me with pansy sitting next to him draco blaise and i were just discussing how i dominated in exploding snap i said happily draco rolled his eyes i sure i opened my mouth to protest but draco promptly stuffed a chocolate frog in it i sputtered and tried to chew it but ended up choking what if i d have died i asked shrilly then weasley would have had to kick draco ass blaise paused again draco flushed and i burst into laughter as did cho pansy looked torn wanting to defend her love oh draco it nothing to be ashamed of i cooed he glared at me you were as much a part of that as i you made up the tune he exclaimed i shrugged you were the genius who decided to instigate i prefer to stay in the shadows drakey you love the limelight draco grinned what can i say he drawled the rest of the train ride passed in similar fashion and before we knew it we were getting off the train meeting draco parents and floo ing to their house erm estate which it was trust me it was a lovely house with a long driveway leading up to it that was rarely if ever used since every guest of the malfoy was capable of magical transport and therefore needed no car i already knew where i d be staying draco and i had known each other so long we had rooms at the other house mr malfoy called for a house elf to take our trunks to our rooms and unpack our things and draco and i settled ourselves down in his large sitting room it was quite warm in the sitting room a nice change from the chilly slytherin common room i curled up on the couch grabbing a blanket and covering myself draco settled himself in a comfy leather armchair and looked over to me you re cold he sounded surprised a bit i shifted trying to get warmer maybe you re just missing someone he teased maybe i closed my eyes dinner soon draco sighed yes it should be ready soon want to go outside for a bit i smiled all right let me go get dressed i ran up to my room and put on warm pants a shirt a sweater and my winter jacket i wrapped a scarf around my neck and put on a hat that george had given me one night while we wandered hogwarts grounds i smiled as i put it on remembering the little snowball fight we had before george had tackled me into the snow i was excited to see him despite how nervous i may be at meeting mrs weasley draco and i walked outside the snow crunching beneath our feet what do you think your parents got you i asked draco shrugged probably just going to pass down some heirloom he said i smirked that apparently you ve taken to selling once again draco shrugged it not like there any sentimental value he said bitterly i looked over at him quickly draco had never said anything like that before oh i couldntthink of anything else to say we walked along in the silence for a bit getting to the little pond at the back of draco property it was where i attempted to learn to ice skate although i wasntthe most graceful person on ice to be sure draco however was as good at skating as he was at everything else how unfair we sat down on a bench looking out at the lake draco i started he looked over at me dontask because i not telling you yet i fell silent well okay then i traced a circle in the now with my feet and looked up at draco he looked tired more tired than i ever remembered him being even during owls there were slight bags under his eyes not very noticeable unless you really looked for them but there nonetheless i sighed i just wish you d talk to me about all of this i said looking down draco told me everything usually even things i didntwant to hear like his late nights with the floozies of hogwarts lexi just drop it he snapped i not telling you anything until i know something for sure besides you canthelp me with it and it none of your business i narrowed my eyes well fine then be that way i stomped off a childish response perhaps i went upstairs and changed for dinner planning on ignoring draco completely and retiring to my room afterwards maybe i d wrap presents for the rest of the night dinner was filling to say the least mr and mrs malfoy had the house elves prepare this absolutely delicious pasta i didntlook up much only answering a question when it was directed towards me so alexis i shuddered as mrs malfoy addressed me still at the top of the class in transfiguration i smiled and nodded as much as i d like to pretend i aced transfiguration without the slightest bit of studying that wasntthe case i was good at it but i worked hard to amplify my talent at it and contrary to what most thought it was really my only strong point i had no interest in charms or dada and without draco help i wouldntpass potions even with snape favoritism herbology was interesting i d say but it was horribly embarrassing to be in longbottom class as he was particularly good at the subject and of course granger excelled at everything except social interaction after dinner i went directly to my room and wrapped presents falling asleep pretty early out of sheer boredom the next few days passed at a relatively fast pace and before i knew it the time had come for me to go to cho s for a few days i had packed all my things and had my bag shrunken to fit into my purse although draco and i hadntbeen on the best of terms for the past few days i couldntjust leave him without saying anything about what was happening i finally plucked up the nerve to go to his room and confronted him he was sitting at his desk writing and put his parchment away as he heard me approach him but didntturn around draco i hate when we dontspeak i said frowning draco nodded i put my hand on his shoulder i leaving soon i shifted my feet and i know you dontwant to tell me whatever going on and i hate that it really pisses me off actually he laughed lexi listen no i mean but you donthave to tell me now i guess i just wanted to wish you good luck with everything while i gone and i hope you know that even though i may not be able to help you if you needed me i d always try i swooped down and gave him a hug i know he said softly and smirked but dontworry about me what you should really be worried about is the obviously overactive reproductive organs every weasley male seems to possess it going to be a job for you to keep yourself from ending up with at least 9 pale little gingers with your freckles of course but as they say lexi abstinence is the best policy right i squeaked in protest and swatted at draco arm i will have you know draco i glared playfully that george and i have done none of that draco grinned thank merlin he stood up and stretched before asking how re you getting there i replied i supposed to floo to diagon alley go to his shop use the backdoor then we re going to floo to the burrow i believe it called i paused is that the name of their house draco shrugged how should i know i grinned as we walked out of his room well drakey i ll see you in a couple days dontforget to send out your presents now i gave him a quick hug you re parents know i leaving right draco nodded yeah but they went to the ministry today i smiled good i paused well draco just good luck you know i know that everything will be fine i frowned slightly arentyou nervous if i were meeting lord voldemort i would be shaking in my warm wool socks draco hesitated before answering confidently of course not i have nothing to be nervous about i raised my eyebrows well just be careful drakey see you in a few days i stepped into the fireplace yelled diagon alley and saw draco waving at me before i was swept off to diagon alley i stepped out into the leaky cauldron and looked around it was bustling of course with witches and wizards doing their christmas shopping i walked slowly down the street looking for something to buy george mother i honestly had no idea what to get her i walked into flourish and blotts and walked up to the counter where they had small trinkets a n okay is it just my bookshop that has like little things to buy up front maybe i didntwant to get mrs weasley something too flashy or expensive or it might seem like i was showing off but i wanted to get something nice i stopped at a candle display everyone loves candles i thought and these were no ordinary candles obviously they changed scents depending on what the person they were bought for wanted it to smell like i shrugged i sure with all those boys stinking up her house molly weasley could use something nice smelling so i bought it i left the store and headed for www i opened the door quietly which didntdo much as a loud bang went off when i entered there were so many people i tried to make myself as inconspicuous as possible and slowly made my way up front and caught fred eye since i had no idea where george was fred winked at me and motioned towards the door leading to back i grinned and headed through the door and ran directly into george oh i sorry i said grabbing onto his arm to steady myself he grinned and pulled me closer really lexi i know i outrageously attractive but try to control yourself at least until we re in a more private setting he said giving me a quick kiss i smirked what makes you think i am even remotely attracted to you hmm he laughed and i joined in that was a lie and we both knew it d you mind staying back here alone for a while we re busier than we though and we have to clear everyone out before we can close i ll come back here as often as i can but he trailed off i gave him a kiss it fine go do your prankster thing okay i smiled and he grinned one of my many irresistible qualities he winked at me and i smiled suddenly very happy that i d be with him for the next two days right you are i gave him a little shove out the door then sat down at a desk i started picking up pieces of paper reading over the twin scribbled ideas for new pranks they were quite brilliant honestly and had they put half as much effort into school as they did into their pranks they would ve done extremely well i not sure how long i sat back there looking at things and poking around which i should ve known was a horrible idea seeing as it was the twin stuff before i caused something to explode oh merlin i exclaimed and jumped back fred rushed back george at his heels they looked at me and then the worktable where a small fire was now going rather nicely then they looked back to me i have no idea how that happened i claimed they burst into laughter and george put the fire out with his wand it fine lexi we have more of them fred said we just need to perfect them see george continued problem is they have a nasty habit of exploding for lack of a better word and we canthave that now can we they finished in unison i started at them for a minute and shook my head guess not i said anyway everyone nearly gone so i ll stay here and finish things up george you and lexi can go on to the lion den fred grinned at my expression oh lexi i kidding my mother a kitten really i distantly recalled saying the same thing to cho about draco and blaise this did not comfort me i felt george hand on my shoulder and he said ready to go i shrugged not really but if we dontgo now i liable to run out of here and make a great getaway i grinned so let go we got to the burrow and the first thing i noticed was the noise unlike my house or draco s this one was bustling and loud and warm and happy and everything a house probably should be but also everything that mine definitely wasnt of course it wasntfancy but it was pretty obvious that a lot of time and effort had gone into making it as welcoming as possible i looked around appreciatively this is cute i said george looked at me oddly well i mean it like homey you know it happy i said simply i looked out the window ohmigods are those chickens i exclaimed george nodded you guys have your own chickens do you like collect eggs from them and everything he nodded again i blinked i have a cat and you have chickens i feel so lame now george grinned we also have a ghoul in the attic i felt my mouth drop a ghoul i had a lousy forgetful house elf who badgered me with clothing and food items that i didntwant and george gets a ghoul i turned taking in all the parts of the kitchen the recently scrubbed table and countertops and this magnificent clock on the wall oh wow what this i asked going towards it instead of stating the time like normal clocks did this clock had a hand for every member of the weasley family and had different places like home work school and travel however everyone hand seemed to be pointing to mortal peril i looked at george curiously i ve never seen a clock like this i paused mortal peril it been like that for a while a clipped tone said from behind me startled i turned around and came face to face with molly weasley of course i had known what she had looked like from the newspaper clipping draco had shoved down weasley throat in second year but seeing her picture and meeting her in person were two very different experiences although molly was rather short and a bit plump it didntmake her any less intimidating to me perhaps becuase being from slytherin i knew not to underestimate anyone that knew what they wanted and mrs weasley was definitely a woman who knew what she wanted when she wanted it and often got it i d imagine that if i had a mother like molly weasley there wasntmuch i wouldntdo to please her but looking at my mother i would say that i was in a similar position however mrs weasley struck me as the type who could stand up to any of her sons no matter how much bigger they were than her and she had a look in her eyes that would strike fear into the heart or lack thereof of voldemort himself she certainly rattled my cage without even trying h h hi i squeaked i heard a snort of amusement from george and wondered why he wasnthelping me out here i awkwardly stuck my hand out i m uh lexi you must be mol mrs weasley george has uhm told me about you she shook my hand and smiled although i wasntsure that it reached her eyes yes lexi george has told me almost nothing about you i frowned wondering what exactly almost meant but she went on but you know how he likes surprises she laughed and this time i could tell it was real she seemed very proud of george no matter how much he got on her nerves i grinned well i sorry he didnttell you more about me i hope you dontmind me coming over i told george that i didntwant to intrude i started rambling but she cut me off oh nonsense if i had a knut for every time i ve heard the words i dontwant to intrude i d be richer than the minister himself the tone she said it with made me think that i would be staying here whether i wanted to or not so i just nodded well thank you very much i paused your house is lovely it so i trailed off homey she asked a small smirk on her face i heard you before dear ah mrs weasley did seem the type who wouldntcondemn a little eavesdropping oh i felt my face heat up and looked over to george silently asking him for help he grinned and stepped up mum how lovely to see you too he said sarcastically if i d known that all i had to do to get you to ignore me was bring a girl home i d have done it ages ago i almost gasped at the way he talked to her but she seemed rather used to it and since a lightning bolt didnt fall from the sky and strike george where he stood i figured it was okay for him to do so oh george dear how are you she instantly transformed into mother mode she sat him down then surprisingly came over to me and led me to a seat obviously neither of you are eating enough look at you george you re skin and bones she exclaimed and i raised me eyebrows as she turned around to prepare us something to eat where your brother she asked george shrugged i dunno said he d be along soon just closing up i expect mrs weasley tsked you boys running between hogwarts and the shop i hope you re getting enough rest george grinned oh mum when i at hogwarts all i do is rest i stifled a giggle while mrs weasley glared at her son now george dontbe shirking your teaching duties she turned to me and i sank back in my chair lexi right i nodded you re in his class right is he doing an adequate job i nodded really he is she smiled good now you be sure to owl me if he ever slacks off right she said sweetly i nodded dumbly how could i refuse molly weasley george groaned oi mum dontcorrupt her he paused then grinned that my job i couldnthold back a laugh this time he did not just say that in front of his mother mrs weasley looked momentarily flustered before changing the subject so lexi tell me about yourself mrs weasley said as she sat down i looked down not know where to start i heard george snort and mutter something about being vague under his breath but mrs weasley ignored him uhm well i paused my nam es lexi as you know conrad actually lexi conrad i saw a flicker of something pass on her face but wasntsure what i in uh slytherin not that that important but i trailed off i in 6th year actually with your son she nodded what classes do you take she asked i found this much easier to answer oh well i take charms which i not too fond of and defense which isnta strong point either potions but i d have to say my partner is better than me at it and herbology and transfiguration george grinned top of her class in transfiguration above mione even mrs weasley smiled quite a feat she said i guess i replied a cup of tea was set in front of me and i took a sip before remembering something oh i exclaimed running over to my bag i have something for you george and mrs weasley looked at each other not sure who i was talking about i took out the bag with mrs weasley present in it and set it in front of her sitting down and wringing my hands nervously she opened the present and smiled it lovely lexi thank you she said setting it on the counter so who are your friends at hogwarts i bit my lower lip well i started cho chang is probably one of my closest girl friends even though i just started talking to her this year mrs weasley nodded and blaise zabini he always been there for me and pansy too i guess she okay i took in a breath but i d have to say that draco my best friend out of the bunch mrs weasley pursed her lips draco malfoy i assume my normally defensive nature almost kicked in and i had to bite my tongue to refrain from snapping at her i nodded and said we ve known each other since birth practically i see i glanced over at george he smiled reassuringly i was not reassured so i trailed off it must be pretty quiet around here well normally i mean with uh all of your children gone for the year i said but i guess they re all back now for the hols speaking of which where is ickle ronniekins george asked i unsuccessfully stifled a laugh and snorted into my tea instead mortifying mrs weasley made a disapproving noise in the back of her throat whether it was directed towards george or myself i couldntsay he harry charlie and ginny are out playing quidditch hermione watching i believe she said i nearly gagged granger was here fan fucking tastic mrs weasley however noticed my reaction and frowned wonderful now she thinks i some crazy pureblood fanatic this tea is uh really good i said lamely george burst into laughter and i felt myself blushing mrs weasley just nodded and cleared away our cups now you two go off and find something to do and that does not include making anything explode crash break or otherwise malfunction george mrs weasley said pointedly try and keep him in line she added to me once again i just nodded because really everyone knew that all i would do who am i to disagree with the fearsome molly weasley because really ginny got to have learned that bat bogey hex i hear so much about from someone and something tells me it sure as hell wasntarthur we went up to george room oh merlin i sat down on a chair wearily that was horrible i did everything wrong she hates me george kissed me on the forehead nah she always a bit rough around the edges he laughed you should ve seen your face when she said mione was here you looked like someone had just set your arse on fire i repressed a smile and swatted at his arm that was not funny she probably thinks i a little lucius junior or something i stood up and started pacing was my present okay he nodded she has a fondness for nice aromas maybe because she in a house full of boys i nodded yeah you do really stink sometimes i grinned and george stood up and lifted me off my feet oh really he said his face centimeters from mine really george leaned in and kissed me more passionately than he ever had before i wrapped my legs around his waist and he held me up somehow maneuvering himself over to his bed as hard as it was i pulled away for a moment george i said nervously he smiled warmly lexi just becuase we re on a bed doesntmean we have to do anything i smiled and relaxed for a few minutes letting george kiss my neck aggressively rather liking the feeling of him being on top of me i felt protected until an image of mrs weasley came into my mind i sat up quickly pushing george off lexi what he sounded confused george i sorry that was amazing that feels amazing but your mother is downstairs she could come up here any moment i whispered george grinned before reaching over to his wand and locking the door you re forgetting lexi dear that i of age and can perform any spells necessary to ensure our privacy he grinned before pressing his lips against mine his argument was logical i thought to myself and who was i to argue with logic ahhadsfhasdfk okay hahah i hope you guys liked that sorry for the wait but i had such a hard time figuring out how to do the meeting with mrs weasley anyway please review whether you liked it or not and i ll try and post again soon but with school coming up it might be a bit late so sorry in advance if it is hey guys sorry it been so long i donthave an excuse other than an immense workload i going to try and upload at least 2 chapters over thanksgiving break and maybe one in between now and then if i have the time thanks to the following reviewers kittylicious hmmm well it will be a bit uncomfortable with hermione there and mrs weasley is kind of iffy about lexi right now thank you so much xxxsour lemonxxx thank you so much i glad mrs weasley was realistic hahah akira sama oh logic is great indeed thanks lilyjet well i sorry it taken so long to update hahah but with school it been taking me forever we had homework on the first day i was like whhhhaaaattt hahah thanks though captain speed o ah really i was so worried about writing molly i glad it was satisfactory hahah lovebuggy hahah yes that exactly what i was thinking too dmg5440 hahah thank you so much i sure lexi will get more comfortable soon and if not she only staying for 2 days anyway and george is sexy he is hahah thank you live2sk8 thank you so much crea oh good luck with college dontworry about forgetting to review hahah i understand but i glad you re still with the story and i glad you liked the chapter silence is silver thanks mavisclone not too shocked and appalled i hope hahah i actually had a really hard time writing the last scene with george and lexi because i dont want it to be too graphic i guess but george is older and it would be silly of me to assume he wouldntthink about stuff like that hahah but i glad you liked the meeting with molly thanks so much jackie pappillion well i honored regardless hahah thank you so much for such a nice review i so glad you liked the story so far lockets and beads thanks lucy blue you made my day hahah seriously with all of those reviews and they were all quite nice thank you so much for every single one of them and indeed there probably is a law or rule of some sort which is why no one really knows about them minus dumbledore who never seemed to mind harry breaking rules now hmm and snape who isnttelling simply because he knows how lexi parents are and is more concerned with her not being hurt by them than getting george in trouble besides they re like two years apart it silly hahah but i was wondering when someone would ask that so yes hahah i doing quite a lot of ignoring of that law probably but molly hermione may or may not bring it up in this chapter hatsue cybanne thank you ryanenight92 thank you and i sorry this took soooo long naeko101 awwe thank you hazeleyedhottie thanks chapter 22 christmas at the burrow day one i successfully avoided granger until dinner by staying in george room eventually fred arrived and joined us and i watched while the twins played a rousing game of chess when i say rousing i mean that in the most sarcastic way possible however soon we heard the voice of molly weasley calling everyone down to dinner george and fred sent me identical grins nervous they chorused together i sighed you ve got no idea i suppose me murdering granger at the table wouldnt exactly endear myself to your mum huh george shook his head but look on the bright side she canttry murdering you either fred added i grimaced and stood up well if you guys wouldntmind leading me downstairs i believe it about time for my untimely demise they laughed and each grabbed one of me arms making it impossible for me to escape hello mum fred said happily as they dragged me around the table and sat me down now really fred george you cantdrag her about like that she not a ragdoll i smiled yes boys you should really be more careful george grinned why it not like we re dating or anything i squeaked in protest and swatted at his arm and then they came in ginny first then potter followed by weasley and granger ginny saw me and grinned giving me a hug over her shoulder i saw molly smile and hoped that any points i had earned for being friends with gingersnap would even out the ones i d lose for hating granger granger froze as she saw me i grinned and gave her weasley and potter a little finger wave potter looked quite amused weasley looked almost sickened by the sight of me and granger looked outraged that i was within 10 feet of her potter grinned lo there conrad potter i nodded giving him a small smile they sat down opposite of george myself and fred ginny sat next to fred and mrs weasley sat at the head of the table mr weasley was still at work i presumed now everyone hurry up before it gets cold i looked in front of me although draco had said the weasley were poor it seemed to me they had enough food on the table to feed a small army and it all looked delicious and it was this is really good i smiled it better than what the house elves at draco m i trailed off as everyone quieted down and stared at me i looked over at george he had a grin on his face what i asked quietly looking around everyone seemed on the verge of hysterical laughter except for three people myself and mrs weasley looked equally confused i raised my eyebrows and she shrugged granger however looked livid did you say house elves she whispered i shrugged well yeah i mean i d shudder at the thought of mrs malfoy actually cooking i paused a light bulb went off in my head oh i exclaimed you i pointed at her you re the crazy girl who goes around with that wretched tin can trying to get innocent students to join your what is it phew glew stew weasley actually laughed spew he grinned i crinkled my nose spew what kind of a name is spew no one wants to join anything named spew i paused spew doesntevoke positive thoughts for me personally hermione finally spoke up it not spew she spat out it s p e w and i ll have you know conrad that house elves are i cut her off completely and deliriously happy for the most part i paused dont you go causing trouble for them granger i ve made my fair share of trips to the kitchens and they are perfectly content perfectly content being brainwashed she replied i shrugged dumbledore d give them wages if they wanted now wouldnthe he gives that nutter dobby wages now right potter opened his mouth to protest oh dobby and i go way back you know he was the malfoy house elf before you freed him i pointed to harry and as nice as he is it d be a boldfaced lie to say he wasnta bit off his rocker harry shrugged and nodded that is completely besides the point hermione continued actually sweet pea that is the point you can lead a horse to water but you cantmake it drink and you can offer house elves whatever you want but you cantmake them accept it and if you did you d be no better than the people who allegedly enslave them now would you i sat back in my chair and grinned triumphantly at her george burst into laughter you guys fight over everything he exclaimed i grinned and changed the subject because really granger fought with me over everything not the other way around anyway mrs weasley what i was trying to say is that this is all really delicious i smiled she looked pleased and proud of herself well thank you dear she paused i d like to talk to you two after dinner she looked at george and i oooooooohhh fred grinned someone in tr ouuuuu bleee he said in a sing song voice i rolled my eyes though inwardly i was nervous what could she want to talk to us about dinner continued without much else happening unless you count fred replacing his mum wand with a fake one for the what i had been told was the 678th time it was still brilliant nonetheless potter weasley and granger got up after a while and excused themselves having finished and surely having important goody goody gryffindor business to attend to ginny started after them for a bit then got up to go see if she could join them i assume fred grinned kissed his mother on the cheek and said he was going home for the evening and that he d be back in the morning for breakfast that left george myself and mrs weasley which is coincidently enough exactly what she wanted in the first place george she started out then added and lexi i cringed way to make me feel insignificant mum george replied evenly i just shifted uncomfortably in my seat george lexi she paused again i could tell she was choosing her words carefully i want to know that you ve both thought about the consequences of your relationship especially you george this puzzled me since most people thought that i d be the one in trouble if george and i were discovered but mrs weasley soon elaborated i mean george you re a teacher she continued i felt my stomach plummet i hadnteven thought of that she was completely right george was a teacher he could get into serious trouble for dating a student i assumed so anyway i mean i dontknow that hogwarts has ever had that problem none of our previous teachers had really been spring chickens i frowned george shrugged well that why we re not telling anybody mum he stopped i only two years older than her less than you and dad actually molly looked about as shocked as i felt at george putting our relationship in the same category as his parents he was comparing us to a married couple and i couldnteven bring myself to admit our relationship to my parents i felt horrible molly seemed to fumble for a minute before regaining her composure george i hardly think that you should be likening your relationship to a marriage she paused you re just like bill rushing into things i frowned now wait just a minute here it not like george was proposing or anything i felt extremely awkward and just wanted to leave immediately mom lexi and i are dating cantyou just be happy that i happy you over think things so much george laughed just relax mrs weasley made a small huffing noise george i just looking out for your best interests both of your best interests she looked at me pointedly i squirmed uncomfortably i uh appreciate the thought mrs weasley i said quietly george grimaced but it unnecessary he stood up i a big boy mum i can take care of myself he started up the stairs i gave mrs weasley a half smile and hurried after him i barely had time to get through his door before he slammed it shut he flopped down on his bed looking rather frustrated i sat down gingerly next to him he must ve felt it becuase he looked up at me sorry about that he whispered it okay i understand i paused i didntexpect it to be easy he groaned i didntexpect my mum to be a prat i shrugged well it true though i didntthink about what could happen to you i paused you could get in trouble you know i yeah i know he said softly i think you re worth it he said confidently this made me feel even worse i wasntworth it i sighed thank you i said laying my head on his shoulder he shifted what wrong he asked i smiled up at him nothing i paused just thinking george grinned i wonder how your little ferret malfoy is getting along without you i grimaced i hadntwanted to think about that fine i hope george tilted his head why do you sound so worried i sure he ll survive without you i sighed i couldntsay too much draco just has to live up to a lot of expectations george looked confused at first and then suspicious wait lexi why did you have to be out of the malfoy house for the next two days i shrugged well you know families like their privacy and i mean my father didntwant me to be around all the time george narrowed his eyes something going on isntit what is it he pressed i shrugged and attempted a smile george it nothing come on it christmas i stood up and stretched i couldntexactly tell george that lord voldemort may or may not be at my best friends house i was staying at what may as well be the center of the order of the phoenix no lexi george just kept pushing it dontyou trust me of course i do but it not my secret to tell why did we always disagree over draco lexi please if something is wrong you have to tell me he pleaded you wouldntunderstand i insisted it about voldemort isntit that why your parents didntwant you there he said quietly i swallowed then nodded they dontthink i m ready i whispered ready george repeated as in they actually expect you to he trailed off looking down at me i looked away well obviously you re not going to right he said even as he said it i think it was more to convince himself than to hear my answer i didntgive one well he asked i opened my mouth then closed it trying again i said i i don t i dontknow at that point george looked somewhere between anger and grief you dontknow he raised his voice lexi how can you even think of that george i said i dontknow i stopped it not as easy for me as it is for you you dontunderstand this is everything i ve ever known my parents are my family and draco what about him this was apparently the wrong thing to say what about him george snapped i sure he doesntneed you babysitting him and if he already signed himself to that fate then that his problem he shouldntexpect you to do the same and your family well they arentmuch of one if they cantrespect your decisions like the way your mother respected yours i snapped then covered my mouth my mum george growled had my best interests at heart can you say the same all your parents are interested in is recruiting for their twisted cause they dontcare about what you think i closed my eyes he was right i doubted my parents ever stopped to think about what i wanted they didntcare about me no i argued they must they have to care at least a little bit dont they i opened my eyes and looked down desperate to think of one time that my parents had shown me affection one time that they had asked me my opinion i couldn t they love me i whispered i i know they do they just can t they cantshow it but it okay they dontneed to i know it i paused george was looking at me almost sympathetically and it made me so angry i didntwant his sympathy i just didnt want to talk about this this was his fault he brought it up you dontknow them i cried and you dontknow draco or blaise or pansy or any of them they all care my parents just want the best for me maybe they arentthere when they should be but but i can make them proud you can george agreed looking at me sadly but is making them proud worth sacrificing everything that you believe in i shook my head i felt something stinging my eyes tears i blinked rapidly george frowned lexi are you no i cut him off i fine just just go away i paused before realizing i was in his room well then i ll go i flung his door open and was faced with the cheery face of fred why if it isntmy favorite snake i rushed past him bumping into his shoulder i ran up to the room george had shown me was ginny s ran in and flung myself on the bed i would be using my conversation with george had shaken me to say the least i had always suspected my parents werentideal but i suppose i d always been able to convince myself at least that they loved me like every parent should love their child but george words ran through my mind shouldntthey be proud of me no matter what i choose to do then again george could hardly understand the complexities of being in my position my family while generally unaccepting accepted me more than most others i didntreally have anyone else besides my family and my close slytherin friends i had george though but did i obviously i dontfit in with his life and if it came down to it he would understandably choose his family friends over me i sighed about half an hour later i heard george come in i felt the bed sink and knew he had sat down lexi he said softly i didntmean to upset you i didnt answer i just we ll talk tomorrow i guess i wish we could just forget this happened i love you he got up and slowly walked to the door when i heard the soft click of the door closing i rolled over ginny and granger both came in a while later but didntsay anything to me i didntsay anything either i was thinking too much to even notice them they turned the lights out but i was wide awake finally i heard a clock somewhere in the house chime twelve times midnight i sat up slowly and crept towards the door i loved george i really did i regretted everything we d both said because really what we talked about had no bearing on the way we felt about each other and besides i had two years to decide what to do i didntwant to worry him he did say he wanted to forget and well i could do that oooohhhh okay i really sorry i just wasntsure how to best write the fight between lexi and george but now that i have that done things will move much more quickly now and i know how to write everything else so it should be easier for me to update on a side note hm hm lexi seems to be a bit crazy did i make her too weird in this chapter i d imagine having someone tell you your parents dontlove you would mess with a person and lexi childhood certainly wasnta loving one so i d imagine it would ve left some type of emotional mark on her and she certainly might be getting up to some trouble reviewwww if you liked it or even if you didn t sorry this is so late guys i ve been swamped with schoolwork thanks to the following reviewers crea thank you so much i glad you enjoyed it xxxsour lemonxxx well you ll find out eventually what lexi chooses but thanks for the review kittylicious thanks lilyjet this is true lexi isnta very emotional person she never really had to deal with the complexities of a relationship before and sometimes deals with it in a completely incorrect way that somehow makes sense in her head as you ll see again in this chapter she ll learn eventually though live2sk8 well their relationship certainly wontbe the same that for sure thank you so much and i really do enjoy writing the fights between lexi and hermione becuase they re actually a lot more alike than either of them realize silence is silver that would be interesting but while hermione doesntlike lexi i dontthink she d put george in that kind of a position toboeshi thank you so much i so happy that people enjoy this sotry and reviews liek that mean so much to me lucyblue thanks of course i read and enjoy every review i get and someone has already suggested hermione telling on lexi and george and although i write hermione in this story as a bit of a bitch i only writing her from the slytherin perspective and i think that she would leave it up to someone like mrs weasley to tell anyone or something rosie awwee thank you i really enjoy writing from a slytherin perspective becuase it so unexplored and really there must be a lot more complexity in their lives than what is said in the books by their enemies the gryffindors no less and there will be much more draco so dontworry naeko101 thanks ansaraeh draco is incredibly underappreciated isnthe hahah thank you last blue mage that would suck hahah but i guess you ll just have to wait and see you re all going to hate me hahah i terribly sorry after the chapter i ll have something about my explanation for lexi behavior chapter 23 a blue christmas i awoke early the next morning it taking me a few seconds to register where i was i quickly got up and changed into a pair of jeans and a shirt before heading downstairs i was almost to the landing of the stairs when i heard a door open a hand pulled me inside wha i felt myself run into something someone rather i looked up and saw george smiling face i grinned morning love he smiled down at me i gave him a quick kiss good morning i replied as he looped an arm around my waist and we began downstairs sleep all right he asked as we got to the kitchen where molly was busying herself with breakfast yeah i lied but he didntknow that of course he didn t as i thought something squirmed in my stomach i swallowed quickly and chalked it up to being hungry you okay fred asked as he sat down i nodded and smiled lightly everything was okay we ate breakfast quickly and the boys decided they wanted to go have a snowball fight outside i turned them down on their offer but said i d watch and unfortunately granger did the same i went up to ginny room with her to bundle up although i wasnttaking part in this snow war it was sure to be cold outside so why were you upset last night she asked as she pulled on a pair of violet snow pants i shrugged as a tugged on a pair of gloves i was just tired is all believe it or not meeting the infamous molly weasley takes a lot out of you ginny laughed i think you did all right as good as can be expected for a rotten slytherin i rolled my eyes and ignored the muffled hey coming from ginny as her mittens hit her in the face come on we dontwant to keep the boys waiting i sat down on a bench in the yard behind the burrow george and fred were already out there and decided ginny was worthy enough to be on their elite team as they said when the golden trio came out granger took one look at me and set off in the opposite direction opening a book she had brought out to read the snowball fight was amusing to say the least the twins had a natural advantage since they could legally do magic and since obviously weasley and potter didntknow that they technically could do undetected magic seeing as how they were in a house full of over aged wizards and their magic would be impossible to differentiate from theirs they lost miserably even with their acclaimed quidditch skills after a few hours my feet were probably frozen which meant i could only imagine how cold they were everyone took a brief hot chocolate break and george came over his hair wet from the snow but his eyes sparkling how it going he asked i smiled but shivered slightly cold he grinned and cast a warming spell on my feet and i instantly felt better here you cantdo magic i forgot oh if only you knew george i grinned and gave him a quick kiss thanking him and ignoring the feeling in the pit of my stomach once again you want to exchange presents i asked his face lit up as he quickly grabbed my hand and led me back into the burrow i laughed i take that as a yes i hurried up to ginny room and grabbed george present after taking off my jacket i crept into his room and grinned as he turned around close your eyes i instructed he did so and i placed the wrapped package in his hands he opened them and then opened his present pulling out a black leather notebook he opened the notebook and looked at the silver colored pages in the front and the normal colored pages in the back he looked up at me okay i started there are two parts to this the front is like a letter i think i have the other half and anything you write i can see the back is just for you i thought you could use it for your joke shop and i mean it never runs out of paper it just keeps adding in pages so i dontknow i thought it d be useful i trailed off biting my lip george grinned at me it brilliant is what it is he hugged me it exactly what i need i smiled as he handed me a small clumsily wrapped package sorry i not the best at wrapping he grinned i smiled back that okay i opened it carefully revealing a small glass rose although it was glass it wasnttransparent it was gorgeous though the light from george room reflecting off of its silver surface oh wow i said holding it delicately what you think that it george laughed look a little closer love i inspected the rose more carefully this time noticing something little and golden on the edge hinges i opened the rose carefully and gasped in shock almost dropping it inside the rose sat the most gorgeous bracelet i d ever seen it was silver and dangly but rather plain except for the small heart charm hanging off of it that had an l engraved on it in an elegant script it wasn t extremely flashy but i thought the simplicity of it made it all the more appealing george i love it i watched as he took the bracelet out and slid it gently onto my wrist a perfect fit looks good on you he commented in an offhanded manner i grinned and leapt on him you re wonderful i told him as i kissed him on the cheek repeatedly when i finally came to my sense he looked a little dazed well that was quite a thank you he winked i should get you jewelry more often i felt my face flush but grinned back nonetheless well this is a special occasion i answered despite my joy the odd feeling was back in the pit of my stomach but once again i shoved it off to the side i didntwant anything to ruin this after dinner that night i went up to ginny room and set the glass rose gently into my trunk nestling it in between my clothing i smiled at myself in the mirror on the back of the door but soon jumped out of the way as it slammed open i looked on in surprise as george stormed into the room looking livid george what the matter i asked he slammed the door locking it and placing a silencing charm he then sat on the bed i was using and took a few breathes i approached him george you know lexi george said trying to keep his voice calm fred just asked me the most interesting question i bit my lower lip there was that feeling again i pushed it aside and said oh well what was that he asked george said angrily if we were okay after the fight we had last night i felt the color drain from my face imagine my surprise and his when i said i didntknow what he was talking about george eyes flashed up to mine i closed my eyes well uhm you see so that begs the question lexi why dont i remember in fact i dontrecall anything from last night after my mum talked to us george stood and closed the distance between us well george it wasntreally anything important and i just think we should forget forget george yelled i stepped back lexi how can i forget anything when i canteven remember i looked down at the ground we fought about my parents i said quietly you upset me and i left then you found me but i wouldnttalk to you and you said you wished we could forget it happened and so and so what george voice was strained you messed with my head do you have any idea how much could ve gone wrong i kept my eyes on the ground but a wave of grief washed over me i hadntthought of what could ve gone wrong no i didntthink he cut me off that right you didntthink you just decided what would be best without even consulting me that not what you do in a relationship lexi you talk you communicate but you dontuse magic to make everything better i canteven trust you now george sounded close to tears i sorry i so sorry i just wanted everything to be okay i grabbed his arm but he shook me off we stood there for a moment until he finally looked up at me i think maybe he paused i think maybe we want different things lexi i think what you want and what i want isnt really compatible right now i felt like the floor was falling out from underneath me was he george what are you saying i asked trying to keep the fear out of my voice i just think that maybe you dontunderstand what it takes you know to be in a relationship and maybe i not the best guy to show you but you are george you really are doesntthe fat that i had good intentions count for anything i asked i canttrust you lexi george answered maybe someday you ll understand but right now i cantbe with someone that i dont trust he turned away just go i opened my mouth but nothing came out i closed my eyes and took in a deep breath all right i said and quickly threw everything in my trunk george stayed in the room as i got ready to leave after i was all packed i walked up to him and held out the bracelet he gave me no keep it it was for you he said quietly and left the room i clutched the bracelet in my hand so hard that it hurt didnthe realize how hard he was making this the fact was george had been nothing but justifiably angry throughout our argument he hadnteven been horrible to me even though i deserved it and he was letting me keep the bracelet it would ve been so much easier if he had the temper his brother had or the irrational logic that granger had but he didnthe was george and throughout the whole thing he remained george and i still loved him i couldntblame him for anything but most importantly i couldnthate him i clutched my trunk and snuck downstairs taking some floo powder and saying quite clearly chang residence the last thing i remember seeing were two identical faces of disappointment as i fell out of cho fireplace i heard her say my name i looked up and opened my mouth but couldntbreath lexi what wrong are you okay you re hyperventilating she exclaimed i calmed myself down and then said cho i ruined it all it all my fault i cried she quickly pulled me into a hug as i explained everything oh lexi she looked down at me with sympathy will you be okay for now i nodded quietly can i just sleep please she nodded and led me to the guest room dont worry lexi we ll think of a way to fix this she said encouragingly i smiled for her benefit but i ws overcome by the feeling that had plagued me all day and i let it flow through me as i realized what it was guilt as i fell asleep i couldnthelp but disagree with cho this was not something that would be easily mended and if i were to make it right i would do it the right way this time wellll there you go hahaha okay before you all kill me just know the story is not over but really lexi isnta very emotional person as you all pointed out and although she did have good intentions she not exactly the most relationship savvy person in the world huh but this is mainly due to her parents relationship not exactly a loving one and how she sees it so you have to understand she d grown up around that and thinks that most relationships are like that but that it accepted and normal when in reality it isn t she ll get away from her parents influence soon enough i promise and let me tell you george weasley isntout of her life so easily becuase he does still care about her so please review with your thoughts etc thanks to the following reviewers lilyjet thank you so much hahah well you never know there could be that xxxsour lemonxxx awe i glad it understandable the way i wrote it thanks mavisclone hahah thank you so much your review made me laugh never fear though this isntthe end of george and lexi crea i am sorry it was so short but i had to cut off there becuase this chapter had to be all together and this one pretty long to make up for it thanks mentally disrupted thanks kittylicious it will be hard for lexi to figure out how to apologize to george and i think for now her pride is definitely going to get in the way i glad you like this story so much i really appreciate when people take the time to tell me that thank you akira sama thank you captain speed o hahah well i am sorry for the shortness of that chapter but this one should be pretty long to make up for it i hope you enjoy it thanks hazeleyedhottie thanks for the review raquelita i so glad you like it and i myself love george weasley stories especially well written ones a flaming moon thank you sanc no george doesntunderstand at all the meanie hahah but then again lexi isntvery understanding either thank you so much chapter 24 christmas by the time i woke up night had settled in and cho parents had already gone to sleep i sat up groggily and looked around the room was dark but i could make out a window across from me i stood up and looked outside it was snowing lightly i turned and made my way out of the room almost running into cho oh good you re awake i was just coming to check on you she said how re you feeling awful i replied but it ll get better right cho frowned it might i sighed i just wrote to blaise she added leading me down the hall i told him he should come but i didntwant to send anything to draco in case his parents read it i nodded but before he comes i wanted to talk to you she said you explained what happened when you arrived here but i still really dontunderstand why because i messed up i said quietly well i mean who broke it off she asked george said that he wasntsure if i understood what it took to be in the type of relationship he wanted i whispered cho i dont know what to do i feel so bad i feel like i actually the horrible person everyone think i am i think that she cut me off lexi you made a mistake everyone makes mistakes you just have to apologize and hope for the best and maybe someday you can show george that you can be in the relationship he wants she paused do you still care about him i shrugged well yes a lot cho he wasnt even mean about it at all he let me keep the bracelet he got me and i just wish he would ve been meaner because then it wouldnt hurt so much i tugged at my shirt cho smiled sadly well lexi for now i think you should just try and get him out of your mind there isn t really anything you can say to him until you see him and that wontbe until break over so there no use in worrying over it now cho i cantsay anything to him anyway what would i say hey george i sorry i messed with your mind for my own selfish purposes want to go get a butterbeer i sure that would work wonderfully i sat down on a couch lexi listen what you did was well stupid but you didntdo it selfishly i ve seen the way you talk about george and i know you wouldnthurt him on purpose anyway she said gently i groaned of course i d never wanted to hurt him but that didnt change the fact that i did cho let just stop george and i are done and talking about it wont change it i said she frowned lexi i dontthink you should give up so easily trust me cho if i want something i dontgive up and i do want george but right now i dontsee us being together and i dontsee anything that could change that if at any point i think differently then i will go for it but right now it not benefiting anyone for me to be fighting an already lost battle cho looked like she wanted to say something then nodded i sorry lexi i know how much you care about him i smiled weakly it all right not your fault anyway i understand though you know i myself have been known for being rubbish at having a relationship i laughed and look where you are now blaise zabini is a far cry from the boy who lived cho grinned that he is we both heard a noise downstairs and speak of the devil we ll have to restrain him you know i said as we made our way downstairs he wontaccept that it my fault cho smiled as i continued draco wonteither we finally reached cho living room where her fireplace was and saw blaise standing there cho he exclaimed seeing her first what happened you mentioned lexi in your letter and he trailed off having seen me lexi he walked over to me what happened did that weasley hurt you oh i bet he did i told him he better not i ll kick his arse i will i have half a mind to floo over there right now he turned back towards the fireplace but cho and i restrained him blaise no really listen i said quickly it was my fault blaise stopped lexi come on you donthave to cover up for him you wouldnthave done anything he shook his head i sighed no blaise really it was my fault i promise you i telling the truth blaise looked down at me and then over to cho who nodded and frowned oh well he trailed off i sorry lex i shrugged but what happened i grimaced not wanting to relate the story but did so anyway blaise sighed merlin lexi i held up a hand i know i know you donthave to say it i smiled but i ll be okay blaise grinned of course you will he paused besides he ll come crawling back once he realizes what life sans lexi is like trust me i rolled my eyes oh i sure after initially talking about george blaise and cho seemed determined to keep me so busy that night that i wouldnthave a chance to think about him much less talk about him i appreciated their effort greatly we spent the night laughing and talking until i felt myself drifting off to sleep on cho couch blaise shook me awake and led me up to the guest room kissing my forehead lightly and promising that he and draco would do everything to fix everything he shut the door and turned off the lights as he and cho left the room i sighed and tried to get some sleep wondering why everyone was so willing to fix my problems for me i woke up late on christmas eve morning and hurried to pack all of my things not wanting to be late getting back to draco s i quickly made sure everything was in my trunk before heading downstairs cho was eating breakfast her parents having already left to do some early morning christmas shopping hi i sat down and grabbed a muffin how long have you been up oh not long cho said but before you leave since you showed up last night i didntsend you your present i thought we could exchange them now i grinned and nodded you sent me yours so it already here cho said walking into her living room with me not far behind she hurried about the christmas tree and i recognized the package i d wrapped for her she pulled out another present and handed it to me i smiled and opened it oh wow cho thanks i said admiring my new navy blue cloak well you do need more color in your wardrobe cho said as she examined the make up kit i had bought her all that green and silver honestly you and blaise are just the same you know he loved the picture of us but i also got him this lovely red sweater that went just right with his hair and he told me it was a gryffindor color i laughed typical blaise what did you say i told him that scarlet was a gryffindor color not just red and if he didntlike it i d take it back and give it to one of my other boyfriends cho grinned cheekily while i burst into laughter i bet he loved that we laughed together and continued talking about blaise among other things until i had to leave draco your best friend in the whole world is back i called as i dusted any soot from the floo powder off my robes he didntanswer which wasntsurprising because if he was in his room he wouldntbe able to hear me anyway i shrugged and left my trunk next to the fireplace confident that a house elf would get it later as i passed the dining room i hear angry voices coming from inside and i stopped before knocking yes i was surprised to hear my mother voice as lucius answered i opened the door oh alexis you re back my mother and narcissa came over to me each giving me a hug how was your time spent at your friends it was lovely mother i held out the cloak she gave me this for a present my mother took it and looked it over before nodding and giving it back to me nice material she said i noticed draco sitting next to his father who was sitting next to my father and everyone looked rather irritated what s going on i asked timidly my father sighed and narcissa answered quietly it seems that the ministry feels it would be appropriate if our annual new year party played host to a more she paused broad range of guests than normal oh yes my mother said viciously how did they phrase it again lucius lucius read from a piece of parchment i hadntnoticed that he d been holding a letter from the minister himself he said silkily answering my questioning gaze he says at a time such as this i am sure that your family having contributed so much to the wizarding community already would not mind opening up your home to others and improving wizarding relations for all of britain he finished a sneer on his face i frowned well they cantmake you can they it not a ministry sponsored event my mother growled of course they cant technically but what else are they supposed to do improve wizarding relations indeed she huffed the minister knows well enough that he not requesting anything and that the malfoys will be forced to open their home to she trailed off with an angry sigh my eyes widened who exactly are they making you open your home to lucius silently passed me a sheet of paper the ministry suggested guest list draco said sarcastically i gasped they can t they can my father said my eyes met draco fearfully for at the very top of the list were the following three names mr harry potter mr mrs arthur weasley and children ms hermione granger an outrage my mother burst from the shadows again think having filth like that in here it unthinkable the malfoy new years party has always been the epitome of sophistication and now it nothing more than a common stomping ground for dumbledore pets i grimaced as i read through the rest of the list she was right now on top of the important ministry officials that were usually in attendance many aurors and well known anti voldemort were also to be invited nymphadora tonks i questioned narcissa laughed bitterly my niece she said disgustedly daughter of my dear sister andromeda i nodded i knew well enough of andromeda estrangement from the rest of her family professor lupin i asked what he got to do with this my mother answered apparently he seeing nymphadora imagine having a filthy half breed here we might as well invite the gamekeeper too lucius laughed i wanted to remind my mother that this wasnttechnically her party but it was well known that the planning was done by my mother and narcissa i scanned the rest of the list i cantbelieve fudge actually proposed this how could he even suggest at telling you who to invite my father answered fudge has been losing popularity and has finally decided to step down meaning they threatened to fire him and he decided to leave on his less embarrassing terms the new minister rufus scrimgeour has yet to learn that people with status such as our are not to be trifled with but you needntworry yourself about it alexis narcissa said quietly you and draco may go outside or upstairs if you wish draco nodded and got up motioning for me to follow so what do you think draco asked as we left i think that it horrible the ministry forcing their agenda on your parents i answered it is but i mean what do you think about the fact that your weasley will be there he said quietly as we entered his room i thought for a moment about how jealous george might be had he known that i was in draco room then i remembered that george and i werent together anymore and he had no reason to be jealous of anyone concerning me i closed my eyes this was going to be harder than i thought draco i started he nodded at me to go on i well you see george and i i frowned we arentreally together anymore i finished feeling my shoulders slump draco eyes widened what lexi what happened he paused his voice growing angry did he hurt you honestly lexi i knew he d do something like this i ll kill the little weasel the next time i see him i promise i shook my head no you dontwant me to kill him draco it was my fault i said quietly sitting on his bed he sat down and wrapped an arm around my shoulder now lexi i know you re a bit daft but you couldnthave done anything to make the boy not want to be with you i mean you re lexi conrad i smiled sadly as encouraging as your constant praise for me is it was most definitely my fault how so draco challenged squeezing my shoulder well you see we got into a bit of a fight a pretty big fight actually i started about well i suppose about you i paused draco looked apologetic and i quickly continued not your fault of course it was more of a fight about my future plans and ah alliances if you know what i mean well that none of his bloody business he not your father draco growled i smiled sadly he was just concerned i guess anyway i left and went up to ginny room and he came in and apologized then everything should be okay draco interrupted unless that wanker messed it up draco please i glared anyway he apologized but i was having none of it i ignored draco sounds of agreement he told me he wished that i paused that he could just forget it ever happened i glanced up at draco he wasntstupid not by a long shot he pieced the rest of the story together quickly and realization dawned on his face but he was silent waiting for me to finish i sighed and i guess i took the literal meaning of what he said so after everyone went to bed i went into his room and i trailed off and made a gesture with my hands lexi draco started but i held up a hand and turned to him i so stupid draco i just i dontknow why i did it i know i shouldnthave i know it was wrong and i feel so horribly guilty about it and i ve never felt guilty about anything in my life and now i ve just ruined everything i had with george which i not even sure was anything serious but it was still the i swallowed it just i ve never been with someone as long as george you know draco nodded i know lex we ll get you through this i grinned and buried my head in his chest i miss him you know i paused well more like i miss the fact that i not that i canttalk to him anymore draco stood up you re a great girl lex you ll find someone i cut him off draco i dontwant to find someone i want george he looked back at me surprised you really er love him then i shrugged i well i guess i mean i do but i guess i still do it not something i can make go away overnight maybe with time it ll fade i looked up at draco hopefully i sure it will he said reassuringly before taking on a more business like tone well this complicates things even further for new year s dont remind me i put my head in my hands why why this year of all years we ll think of something dontworry we just have to make sure none of the weasleys snitch to any of our parents which means we ll have to stay as far away from them as possible which shouldntbe hard to explain to our parents i said it not like we d have to convince them to keep us away from the weasleys draco nodded you can do this lexi he said smiling i shrugged kind of have to donti after the initial shock i received upon arriving at draco s things were dull leading up to christmas my parents left on their trip the malfoys were always busy with preparations for christmas and draco and i were left o our own devices christmas morning was fun however i woke up the bright winter sun flashing through the curtains in the guest room i slept in the clock next to my bed read 9 30 which meant i was a little late in opening my presents i hurriedly pulled a robe on and shuffled to draco room which was right down the hall being close to the malfoy got me a guest room near where they slept while most other people slept on the other side of their house drakey i shook him he mumbles something incoherently and i sighed this was going to be harder than i thought draco malfoy merlin lexi what he snapped from underneath his pillow it christmas you dolt i exclaimed happily he sat up groggily a grin on his face happy christmas lexi happy christmas drakey now let go i tugged at his hand we hurried downstairs to find lucius narcissa and my mother and father already up narcissa brewing coffee and lucius and my father reading the newspaper up finally my mother even sounded cheerful i grinned it was very hard to wake draco up i laughed well let eat and then open presents narcissa decided draco and i ate quickly and ushered our families into the sitting room where a large tree was decorated in silver decorations even christmas couldntescape the green and silver slytherin color scheme we went in a circle opening presents which worked for a while but obviously since draco and i had more presents than our parents didntlast long i had gotten my mother a new eagle feather quill which she had complained of needing for a while for my father i got a glass and silver chess set both my parents thanked me draco got of course family heirlooms but also a new broom a firebolt to match potter s he was ecstatic naturally he was also pleased with the top of the line broomstick servicing kit my parents got him here draco i thrust the small package that i had wrapped for him into shi hands he opened it and stared in fascination at the watch i had gotten him with lucius peering over his shoulders it got a basic protection charm has it lucius asked nodding i smiled and nodded draco grinned at me and fastened the watch onto his wrist thanks lexi i smiled and nodded before opening draco present i had gotten new dress robes from my mother and various hair accessories and makeup as well as a book full of cosmetic spells my father however got me something a little more practical a leather holster for my wand i didntquite understand why i d need one but it was nicely made nonetheless draco present was something else entirely but quite similar to what i d gotten him it was a necklace with a bright blue drop hanging on the end of a simple silver chain it reminded me for a moment of the bracelet george had gotten me but i pushed the though out of my mind it was christmas after all and i didntwant to ruin it with thinking of things that i couldntchange oh draco it lovely i exclaimed softly you re not the only one who thought to give a little extra protection out for christmas draco muttered in my ear as he put the necklace around my neck i grinned didnt know you cared so much drakey i cooed back softly grinning more than you know lex he said seriously smiling before he walked back over to his parents so you re coming to draco party right i asked cho her head bobbing up and down in draco fireplace of course wouldntmiss it she replied as i breathed a sigh of relief thank merlin did you hear about who they have to invite suggested by the minister i continued blaise mentioned something but he didntelaborate cho said looking curious well i started let me just say that the ministry approved guest list is horrendous and of course at the tope of the list they wouldntdare cho interrupted harry potter i confirmed and you know the weasley and granger are never far behind cho frowned but that means that george will most likely be there i finished things just keep getting better dontthey i laughed bitterly at least i wont have to worry about slipping up and being affectionate towards him or vice versa cho smiled sadly we ll just have to show him what he missing out on that all she grinned a little healthy jealousy never hurt anybody i smiled wasntaware that any type of jealousy was healthy chang she laughed oh of course we ll just be causing the healthy type naturally i laughed as she continued here what we ll do i grinned as i listened to her plan it was fun to think about although there was the chance that it may not even work but a girl deserves to have some fun doesntshe yay okay so here you go guys a new chapter i hope you liked it i getting piled with schoolwork so it might be like 2 weeks until the next update but i ll try my hardest to make it before then review with what you liked or didntlike or anything thanks to the following reviewers akira sama thank you lilyjet i glad you enjoyed it thanks xxxsour lemonxxx well i would think they would if only becuase they felt they d look bad by refusing to go and also i would assume ron would love any reason to annoy draco and him going to a party where although he invited he clearly not welcome would probably appeal to him as it would annoy draco a lot and i sorry about the lexi draco implications hahah i got a lot about that silence is silver george is naturally always going to be a bit jealous of draco and i dontthink lexi fully realizes it yet so i not so sure she ll intentionally use him crea hahaha i can definitely hear the oh no he didn t and i really glad you liked the chapter kittylicious of course i have to have them see each other bwahahah and i do love draco when he sweet dontyou thanks ilovegrednforgex0o hahaha thanks so much i a bit overly sarcastic so i glad that it appreciated nonetheless last blue mage thank you and no he doesn t hahah i sorry i worried everyone bookworm2011 i glad you like the plot so much and there are going to be quite a few twists before the story is over so be warned thank you mavisclone hahah thank you i glad you thought the guest list was funny and if ron is any indication of the weasley jealousy then we can be sure george will get jealous chapter 25 new years merlin cho i cantdo this i exclaimed my hands are shaking the days leading up to the ball had been stressful to say the least cho was convinced that making george jealous would lead me right back into his arms i was convinced that although cunning was a slytherin forte i ve never been a magnet for jealousy especially intended jealousy i told cho this and she said oh but you wonthave to do anything lexi boy are naturally jealous creatures and they always look at their ex girlfriends besides which george must still like you or else he wouldntlet you keep the bracelet it like he asking you to fight for him these eased most of my fears cho plan was quite simple really she was going to come and help me get ready and help me look as gorgeous as possible as she put it then it was my job to dance with as many boys as possible that night something which my mother encouraged anyway as she wanted me to become something of a socialite i myself would much rather hang out with my friends a night of bad dancing is worth getting george back isntit cho had asked i agreed but wondered if this would really get george back still cho had more experience in this field okay cho finished applying my eyeliner do you want gloves or not i shook my head gloves dontgo well with dress robes my dress robes were a deep purple color almost an eggplant which sounds revolting but was really quite nice cho was wearing deep red dress robes that went with her hair nicely blaise taught you the opening dance right i asked although their home would be intruded on the malfoys were determined to show everyone exactly who belonged there and who didn t they decided to do this by having an opening dance that they were sure only the pureblooded society would know i myself was dancing with draco yes he did she paused do you know if they re coming by they she meant potter granger and the weasleys i sighed well they rvsped i dontknow why they re coming they donteven like the malfoys i said desperately it would be so much easier if they d just stay home cho smiled sympathetically well you know ron he d do anything to annoy draco even crashing his party they re probably just coming to prove they can granger probably going to try and meet some influential people to further herself i rolled my eyes that is such a slytherin thing to do brown nosing someone who more important than you she incredibly ambitious if it werentfor the fact that she a muggleborn she d be in slytherin i bet cho grinned that would certainly put a cramp in the golden trio i nodded a cramp in my life too it bad enough i have classes with her imagine sharing a dorm we continued getting ready in a comfortable silence cho did my makeup for me and i styled her hair into an elegant bun we sat in my room until my mother came to get us saying it was almost time for the party to start and that people were arriving i sighed and stood up cho following now remember alexis it essential that you at least try and move beyond your normal scope of friends my mother reminded me i nodded trying not to roll my eyes i know mother i replied cho and i waited in the hallway for draco and blaise you re excited cho asked i shrugged you ve been to one of these you ve been tot hem all i said ignoring the pounding of my heart but how many of those has your ex boyfriend attended cho whispered i looked at her biting my lower lip none she smiled reassuringly as blaise and draco approached i grinned at draco in his ice blue robes nice change from silver i told you so i smirked he rolled his eyes and held an arm out for me i linked mine through his thanks for escorting me i paused at least now i wontlook completely lame draco nodded what respectable girl doesnthave an escort although we ve gone together for years now i grinned as we approached the stairs i could hear the party going on cho and blaise you first cho and blaise swept by us gliding down the stairs amidst the chatter going on below i took in a breath you ready i asked i normally wasnt so nervous but i knew that george would be down there and would see me as i entered draco smiled at me you ll knock his socks off lex i grinned let hope we started going down to the party me worrying constantly that i was going to trip draco being naturally more graceful than i kept a tight grip on my arm to steady me the decorations in the malfoy ballroom were lovely the giant chandelier sparkled down on the shiny marble floor and little crystals floated around light shining out of them for extra lighting there were roughly one hundred small round tables on one end of the hall a dance floor and a snack bar at the other end elegant white loveseats lined the other walls for people to sit on and outside the gardens were lit up i looked around and noticed people looking up at draco and i some nodding their heads approvingly in particular the old ladies sitting in the corner of the room i felt my neck begin to heat up and fought to keep from blushing i didntwant people to think we were together dont look at everyone focus on something else draco murmured in my ear i nodded but only slightly we finally reached the bottom of the staircase and i breathed a sigh of relief cho and blaise were waiting for us and i look up to see my parents start to descend let go find out table draco said we wouldntbe sitting with the adults for even our parents knew how bored we would be we were a little away from the adults table s sitting with pansy crabbe goyle and daphne greengrass a quick witted girl who unfortunately allowed herself to be known for her pretty looks rather than her personality draco daphne batted her eyelashes it a pity what the ministry done to your party we ve all heard about it naturally pansy nodded sympathetically as daphne continued why look who sitting only a few tables over potter the weasleys and that filthy mudblood i turned in the direction she had pointed in and sure enough only two tables away sat potter in emerald green robes looking thoroughly impressed granger was more interested in the people than the decor and weasley was more interested in eating it appeared as he was staring at his plate ginny was there too in dark grey dress robes charlie and bill i assumed would be sitting with their parents but i saw george and fred talking to a woman with bubble gum pink hair i felt the familiar tug of jealousy wasnt george supposed to be the one who was jealous who is that i nodded disdainfully in the direction of the pink haired witch and why would she come here with hair like that draco scoffed that nymphadora tonks remember lex her mother is my mother sister we re cousins he spat i grinned well why dontyou go introduce yourself drakey have a family reunion our table filled with laughter and draco pale cheeks were tinted with pink he grinned however of course dontyou see the resemblance we all turned and watched as this tonks made her nose look like a pigs more laughter followed i do see it now that you mention it the noses in particular are alike daphne grinned we talked a bit longer before i looked around the room again draco your parents invited the bulgarians i said recognizing the famous viktor krum and his friends draco nodded and daphne eyes lit up she must ve found her target for the night he mine she said deviously smirking unless granger snags him first blaise pointed out daphne tossed her hair over her shoulder please viktor may have been fool enough to give her a chance once but she blew it for the little weasel she said coolly i grinned but it vanished as the music began to warm up well lexi looks like we ve got to go i stood up with draco blaise and cho rising as well daphne stood and walked over to viktor apparently to ask him to dance not many people were standing to dance and those who were were obviously from pureblood families draco and i stood opposite of each other and he bowed slightly i smiled and curtsied in return cho was to my right and daphne to my left looking triumphant with viktor as her partner blaise was on draco right and viktor was on his left looking as surly as ever the music began and draco put his hand on my waist the other on my shoulder and i did likewise he began leading me through a tricky pattern of steps because naturally it was more common for the male to lead he spun me once before muttering in my ear weasley looking at you check when we turn i smiled to show i had heard him and when we turned chanced a glance in george direction he was indeed looking in my direction although i was spun so quickly i couldnttell if it was at me or not the dance ended quickly and we sat down to the applause of those who hadntdanced wasnt that fun daphne said eyes shining i sure viktor was a brilliant conversationalist i replied but it seems he visiting his precious her my own i put on a fake bulgarian accent daphne eyes snapped over to their table that little mudblood she stood up excuse me i ve got to go retrieve the poor boy we watched as she marched over to the table laying a hand protectively on krum arm and smiling in an overly sweet manner at granger before leading krum over to our table here comes the party blaise said grinning wickedly i couldnthelp but laugh and tried to stifle it as krum sat down viktor it been a while draco held out his hand which krum shook i nodded it been so long how ve you been viktor i asked sweetly he grunted and nodded i haff been okay it nice to be here vhere it varmer we all nodded sympathetically music was playing and i felt a tap on my shoulder i turned and faced my mother alexis what are you doing get out there and socialize she whispered i sighed a nodded pansy accompany me she nodded my parents want me to get around the room too tonight pansy confided they just dontunderstand that drakey and i are going to be together forever i blinked i had known pansy liked draco even claimed to love him but this was the first time that she had mentioned anything about them being together forever pansy i started i know lexi she whispered i was kidding he acts like i dontrealize you know the things he says about me but i not stupid i have no hopes for draco and i but the least i can do is make his life as uncomfortable as i can you know i shrugged i guess hell hath no fury exactly miles bletchley and marcus flint approached us i call miles i said immediately marcus flint was known to have roaming hands and while the plan was to make george jealous i didnt want to make myself sick in the process hello ladies flint said in his greasy voice miles i smiled marcus how are you miles grinned all right and yourself i shrugged content to say the least pansy smiled dontthe decorations look lovely as lovely as the two of you do marcus said miles raised an eyebrow and i smothered a laugh dance lexi miles asked it been a while i grinned sure we headed towards the dance floor and miles whispered i ve been trying to get rid of flint all night i laughed i can see why why were you with him anyway i asked as he led me in a waltz ran into him on the way in he decided we should stick together while we what did he say get the ladies i laughed so asking me to dace was just a clever ruse to get a lady nah just wanted to catch up with a classmate from hogwarts i think zabini and malfoy would kill me if i tried anything with you he paused so how are things are dear old hogwarts potter still gleaning attention wherever he goes i nodded but what else is new he quidditch captain this year but i think even we saw that coming so how your life been lexi he made conversation as we went about the floor not bad i ve got blaise set up with cho chang see over there i pointed them out i did see them as a matter of fact well hopefully she can keep blaise attention he let go of my arms as the song ended it been a real treat lexi i ll talk to you later okay i nodded and headed back over to my table potter was dancing with ginny and weasley and granger seemed to be having one of their frequent fights most likely over krum i sighed and sat down i kept sneaking glances over at george but so far he wasntpaying me any attention you re not going to make him jealous by sitting here doing nothing ch said quickly as she sat down get out there and what risk becoming marcus flint next victim i think not i tossed my hair over my shoulder i going to get some punch i stood and walked towards the punch table which meant i d have to walk past his table dont look over dontlook over dontlook over i neared the table and i heard a voice call out well if it isnt alexis victoria conrad i was wondering when i d get to see your pretty little face the voice said teasingly i whipped my head around to see who it was adrian pucey i sucked in a breath he was just as devilishly handsome as i had remembered him being last year when he graduated adrian pucey had been my childhood crush from first year until fourth year and with good reason he was tall and well built with tan skin and dazzling white teeth his dark hair fell into his hazel eyes with elegance and he spoke so charmingly that i shook my head a silly school girl crush nothing more i grinned at adrian adrian what are you doing here last i heard you were still in france he laughed and put an arm around my shoulder leading me to his table right next to the weasleys i was pet but then i got an invite to this shindig and i thought what better way to spend my new years than with a few old friends and of course my number one fan lexi conrad he pinched my cheek and i ducked hiding my blushing face well uh how ve you been i stuttered looking over at cho who was positively beaming at me i ve been wonderful m dear he said and began recounting tales of his wild times in innner0city paris i soon found myself laughing and not caring that i was sitting next to the entire weasley clan and how hogwarts been he asked after telling me a wonderfully embarrassing story about a tryst with a witch from orleans oh you know the usual i did well on my owls my parents were pleased mainly keeping draco and blaise out of trouble i said shrugging you always have love he pinched my cheek again you really ought to take some time for yourself you know they can take care of themselves although i sure it nice to have a pretty little witch like yourself looking after them surprised you re not in ravenclaw with those brains i blushed again i had forgotten that adrian pucey was also a notorious flirt well you know wit and cunning arenttoo far off from each other i replied grinning i supposed i ve got more of the latter is all and your talent would be dreadfully wasted in the bird nest now wouldntit he grinned as well would the lovely lexi grant me a dance i bit my lower lip and snuck a glance at george table he was looking determinedly away from me i forced a smile of course adrian what a dance between friends right just my luck that i d be dancing to a slow song with adrian pucey he wrapped his arms around my waist and i put mine around his neck i could see my mother smiling approvingly at me from a distance she was probably planning the wedding already so pet which of those slytherin boys did you end up with hm he muttered in my ear it tickled but wasntnearly as nice as george s wouldnt adrian laugh if i told him it were a gryffindor i ended up with i had to remind myself that i wasntwith him anymore none of them you know most slytherin boys are only interested in a quick shag i answered easily isnt that the truth though he murmured resting his chin on my head i miss it someimtes you know hogwarts it a lot of responsibility being grown up i looked him in the eye adrian are you i mean if i not intruding but do you well do you ah support uh he smiled ambitious and cunning though i am i ve no interest in that sort of power i smiled what about you pet i know you ve got a lot to live up to personally i think you re too good for it i frowned i dontexactly know what i going to do with my life he nodded sympathetically i didnteither but then you know i said bullocks to you all this is my life and went off to france i looked up at him again that why you left i exclaimed quietly the song started to end and adrian pulled me close love i want you to remember anything you need anything at all you write me i always willing to help out a friend he paused before kissing my forehead lightly and we always have a choice lexi dontforget that thank you adrian i said quietly i d better make my exit before i get cornered by some unsavory characters i ll see you later he grasped my hand quickly and then left i stood there dazed for a few seconds before blaise swooped down on me pucey eh good choice he said swinging me around i shook my head he a character i said but a gentleman blaise nodded he always knew how to make us laugh he smirked i remember you were quite smitten with him i was i exclaimed snootily but he just a friend and i ve long gotten over my silly little crush on him well then lexi answer me this why were you blushing furiously when you were talking to him blaise asked triumphantly i rolled my eyes because adrian pucey is an incorrigible flirt that why well while pucey was flirting with you oh so incorrigibly a certain redhead was steaming with envy blaise laughed and i thought it was his brother with the temper my eyes widened george was jealous i subtly snuck a look over at him and indeed he was glowering at the floor i wanted to go over and give him a hug but resisted because after all we werent together anymore oh blaise i didntreally want to make him jealous i exclaimed what if he thinks i some sort of floozy or something he wontlexi because you re not blaise said as we went back to our table cho was grinning from ear to ear lexi you did wonderfully it also helps that pcuey table was right next to theirs and blaise told me about your little crush on him and i cut her off thanks cho my mother occupied the seat next to me alexis i wasntaware that you knew adrian pucey he quite handsome isnthe my mother simpered i nodded we went to hogwarts together mother of course my mother waved her hand dismissively but you two looked simply adorable together is he staying in england long maybe he could meet with you on a hogsmeade weekend he d have to ask your fathers permission of course but i d be sure to put in a good word my mother smiled at me i felt like laughing excuse me we turned to see harry bleeding potter standing there yes my mother asked coolly i was wondering if i could have a dance with ah lexi is it he asked my mouth dropped open what was he playing at my mother looked torn on the one hand she didntwant her daughter dancing with the boy who lived on the other hand she had no right to refuse him she nodded stonily at me and i stood up took potter arm and joined him on the dance floor didnt know you could dance potter i glared at him learn something new everyday he replied okay what do you want i snapped as we spun around how dare you come up to me in front of my mother no less do you know what she would say if she thought i was friends with you which we are not by the way he shrugged i just thought it d be a good idea for me to dance with you as george is liable to kill the next bloke who dances with you especially if he anything like pucey was i looked at the ground george is uhm he noticed me then of course he did conrad harry paused what happened anyway i stepped on his foot that is none of your business i paused you mean he didn t tell you guys no he wonttalk about it much he was dead set against coming tonight too took a lot to convince him to come potter said as casually as if he were talking about the weather oh i paused i i dontwant him to be upset you know please tell him that i sucked in a breath that s what i like about him you know he always so happy it d be a shame if he weren t potter nodded it would be he paused but really what did you do to him i glared at him again something totally and despicably slytherin i can assure you the song ended i d like to say it been a pleasure but unfortunately i not that good at lying potter just grinned see you around lexi i wanted to punch that boy sometimes my mother caught up with me alexis why would harry potter want to dance with you to annoy draco what else he and draco are always at odds and he just wants to bother draco and everyone around him my mother nodded i sorry i couldntcome up with a better excuse she said i nodded it not anyone fault but potter s i said and she agreed i made my way out into the garden and sat down on a bench i sighed tonight had been nothing but troublesome i leaned against the cold metal of the bench admiring the fountains and trees on the malfoys garden he really upset you know a voice said from behind me i close my eyes and turned fred the protective twin brother i should ve been expecting this i know i said quietly he sat next to me obviously you dontknow or you wouldntbe dancing with different blokes left and right all evening fred snapped i frowned listen fred my mother told me to socialize and i cantjust not listen to her i said angrily i sure you re mother would ve understood that you d just broken up with oh wait that right you never even told her about you and george he hissed i stood up for a good reason fred one that you didnt seem to have a problem with only a few days ago all i saying lexi is that your entire relationship with george seemed pretty one sided he stood as well one sided you have no idea what i would ve sacrificed for george i almost gave up my friendship with blaise for him one of my best friends i paused how dare you even suggest that i don care about george well you seemed only too happy to run back to your perfect pampered pureblood life didntyou he said venomously i clenched my fists my life is far from perfect fred weasley you have no idea what my life is like and if that all you think of me then get the hell out of my sight i dontowe you or anyone else an explanation i made a mistake i human i dontneed you telling me what a horrible person i am we were both breathing heavily i hope you re happy with the way you ve made things lexi fred snarled and walked off i stood there fuming and decided my night was over i walked back into the party and made my way to the staircase hoping to escape quietly i walked by the tables and was unfortunately accosted by a very drunk marcus flint lexxxxxxxi i haventhad the pleasure of dancing with you tonight he said in a husky voice he leaned against me and i pushed him away i terribly sorry marcus but i not feeling well at all i think i going to go lie down i said quietly i glanced up and saw george staring at me an unreadable expression on his face i bit my lower lip i could feel the tension between us suddenly i was jostled by flint and the eye contact was broken awe cmon lex just one dance he asked putting his hands around my waist no marcus i tried shoving him off but he was much stronger than me and i couldn t flint i serious get off of me one dance wonthurt he purred in my ear flint do you just not listen when a girl says no or dontyou understand the concept a voice said close to us flint let go of me and said angrily bugger off weasley this has nothing to do with you i turned and saw george standing there looking livid i wanted to run into his arms but unfortunately flint stood in front of me possessively maybe not but i dontthink malfoy would be too pleased if he heard you were manhandling his best mate george snapped have some class flint flint growled and stalked away i stood there staring at george who ears were starting to redden george i mean you didnthave to but thank you i said quietly he nodded slightly and we stared at each other for a few minutes before he shook his head turned around and walked back to his brothers i blinked and looked down before making my way to my room knowing once i was by myself my night couldntget any worse cho plan had in essence been a success but i hadntachieved anything but apparently making george and any weasley that had liked me before hate me i had told cho before that it would ve been easier for me to hate george if he had hated me and that i had wished he wouldnthave been so nice to me but now that it seemed he did hate me i wanted nothing more than to have what i had had before civility with him at the very least it seemed to me things were going to get a lot worse before they got any better did you guys like it and it extra long too oh la la well you know the drill review what you liked what you didntlike etc and i for one loved writing adrian pucey character there no definite timeline as to his years at hogwarts but he at least a year older than harry and no more than two years older than him so i just made him the same year as the twins because it fits isnthe a charmer though and no draco isntromantically interested in lexi for those of you who were wondering but he does indeed love her quite possibly more than he loves anything else but platonically sorry for the delay everyone but here the next chapter so instead of thanking each review and taking up space i just going to thank all my reviewers at once unless one reviewer asks a

fairy toby live2sk8 lovebuggy xxxsour lemonxxx skydancer389 womanofsporks mysti melodiespunk hope iness chapter 26 plans revealed the day after the party wasntvery eventful i stayed in my room all day saying i had been worn out by the activities of the evening before my parents as well as draco s were only too happy to leave me to my own devices draco wasntas kind lexi he pounded on my door come on open up i tired draco i called back grumpily he persisted until finally i yanked the door open what do you want i asked he walked by me into my room and flopped down on my bed listen lexi i told you before i wouldntstand for you being some heartbroken loser he said simply i glared at him shut up draco i snapped i was entitled to a bit of sulking lexi listen i know you liked this weasley for whatever reason draco paused but do you really think you re going to get him back by sitting here pouting i snorted thanks for the effort draco but i ve already tried to scheme my way back into george good graces draco rolled his eyes i not saying you should what i am saying is he didntlike you when you were whining like a little baby did he no he liked a happy lexi conrad so what makes you think if you keep this attitude up he ll look your way again i shook my head draco we re done just please drop it draco sighed come on he stood up we re going to diagon alley and you will not be sulking i ll sulk if i inclined to i said huffing as i stood we re leaving in 20 minutes he said as he closed my door i sighed and went to change into something more suitable for diagon alley i doubted my pajamas would suffice i dressed quickly and threw on my cloak before headed downstairs okay draco i ready i grumbled adding what do we need to do there anyway get the stick out of your ass what else i rolled my eyes but followed him through the fireplace anyway diagon alley wasntas crowded as it normally is most families spending the last couple days of the holiday break together let go to quality quidditch draco decided i rolled my eyes and followed we went in and i was quickly led to the latest broom handle models draco this doesntinterest me i sighed there were a few students i recognized in the shop many slytherins greeted draco and i but all i could do was smile weakly back lexi how can this not interest you this broom handle has a patent leather pad on it so that the players hands dontget sore draco exclaimed his eyes shining as they did only when he talked about quidditch i sighed in any case are we done here draco rolled his eyes in irritation and grabbed the broom handle nodding let me pay for this after exiting quality quidditch we went to flourish and blotts since draco wanted to see which books they had on potions and i wanted to see if they had any new books on animagus draco unfortunately didntfind any new books but i found an interesting book entitled human transfiguration the path to animagus draco and i walked up and down the street and i found myself cheering up bit by bit we finally decided to have dinner at the leaky cauldron and call it a day i hadnteven thought about george for most of the day i was pleased to find draco and i seated ourselves at a booth in the back of the leaky cauldron and ordered i looked up as i heard a commotion near the floo connection i saw two flashes of red hair and struggled to hide myself in my seat as george and fred dusted themselves off lexi draco hissed across from me you will not hide like some little hufflepuff my face flushed momentarily as i responded i am not scared draco i paused i ve just got some tact and i unlike you dontthrive on awkward and tense situations i watched as george and fred laughed at something with tom as they ordered dinner oh no please dontbe staying i whispered it would be quite uncomfortable as draco and i were almost done eating and we d have to walk by them to use the floo well we re done here lexi draco didntseem to notice anything wrong i paused actually i was thinking maybe we could just wait here for a bit i mean why do we want to go back so soon i asked offering him a smile he narrowed his eyes lexi i should hope that you wouldntbe afraid to walk by those weasels you ve got as much right to be here as they do he smirked now let go remind them of that he stood and i followed grudgingly i almost had a hope that we d be able to get to the floo without attracting any attention that was until tom called out to us to have a nice day i cringed as i felt the twins eyes on my back draco just sneered at them and grabbed my arm leading me away i turned around as we got to the fireplace to find fred had already turned back to his meal george eyes were still on me and as our eyes met i felt myself resisting the urge to run over to him i bit my lower lip as we stared at each other fred was right george looked upset i smiled at him and he frowned before turning away i closed my eyes but said nothing i should have expected that come on lexi draco led me into the fireplace and the next thing i knew i was back at draco house well that was rude of them wasntit not so much as a greeting draco joked i rolled my eyes would you have returned a greeting i asked he smirked probably not i sighed it wasntso bad today was it draco asked concern flashing for a second in his eyes i stared at him it hadntbeen that bad and he was trying so hard to make me feel better no draco thank you so much i smiled warmly at him he grinned we worked on our homework for the rest of the afternoon before packing our trunks for the journey home tomorrow after dinner i excused myself and headed up to my room to think i showered quickly and changed into my pajamas before climbing into bed i didntwant to be sad about breaking up with george not when everyone wanted me to be okay besides it would ve been foolish for me to have not seen this coming i certainly couldnthave expected us to be together forever that would ve been ridiculous i told myself then that i was just upset becuase it was so sudden and abrupt not to mention george was the first boy i really loved romantically anyway it hurt we re over i told myself firmly hurting wontchange that so i decided not to hurt although i had loved george and i knew deep down that i still did i didntwant to dwell on it becuase there was nothing i could do i would stop dwelling on george and our memories together because memories are nice but that all they are i whispered to myself as i turned out the lamp near my bed you know i never noticed before now that the hogwarts express is decidedly gryffindor draco commented as we stood in front of the steam engine waiting for draco house elves to load our trunks how so i asked scarlet he said as though it were obvious which it kind of was maybe you re reading too much into it i paused besides does gryffindor have a monopoly on all red colors of course draco said incredulous just like we have green i shrugged emerald green draco looked offended all green suuuuure we laughed and boarded the train where blaise i asked as we looked for a compartment draco opened the door to an empty compartment as he answered not sure but listen lexi i need to talk to you about something i felt something drop in the pit of my stomach as draco locked and silenced the door what is it draco i asked uneasily he looked at me a moment torn before sitting down and covering his face with his hands i d never seen him so visibly upset i cantdo it he whispered i looked at him and sat down next to him what do you mean what cantyou do i asked putting a hand on his back i cantdo it lexi i can t i cantdo i cant be that he said desperately and suddenly i understood he couldntbe a death eater oh draco i asked comfortingly pulling him into a hug he wrapped his arms around my waist and hid his face what happened i just i always knew what i d have to do i knew and i thought i thought the way they talked about it it d be easier he laughed hollowly fun even i met with him and he said he was sure i d be as good as my father he paused then he said i had to see to watch and learn and so he he summoned bella he trailed off and i closed my eyes bellatrix lestrange she was a powerful she was a monster she d never been anything but nice to me but it was always easy to sense that she really didntlike anyone but the dark lord sometimes i thought she didnteven like her own husband and i was probably right what happened then i asked softly draco obviously needed to talk this out she took me to a house muggle house obviously draco paused he told me not to do anything so i just watched it was so fast lexi she killed them all of them it was so fast but i still saw everything it seemed to go in slow motion but it was really so fast his grip on my waist tightened then we left like nothing out of the ordinary had just happened like bella hadntjust killed an innocent family he paused i felt sick you know what i did what i asked i smiled i fucking smiled i smiled because i knew that what she wanted what he wanted what my goddamned father wanted i smiled and i laughed like it was funny like watching a mother beg for mercy then dropping dead in front of her children was something to laugh at it was hell lexi i so sorry draco i held him closer then i went home and they were smiling too he and my father and i almost threw up but i kept smiling i could still hear them all screaming lexi i can still hear them all screaming he lifted his head up and looked at me and that what he wants me to do when i initiated and i can t i cantdo it i sighed is there anything i can do what do you plan to do draco shrugged i ve been planning for this i think i ve always known that i couldntdo it i never wanted to admit it i dontwant to now it doesntmake you a bad person draco quite the opposite but it a very delicate situation i paused your parents wontbe happy i know what are you going to do i asked again you said you ve been planning i trailed off it suddenly all fit draco sneaking off on his own all the time draco selling his family heirlooms draco wanting to learn occulmency he was going to run draco you cantbe thinking of going off on your own i said slowly he had to realize i have to lexi he answered no no you don t i said angrily you ll be killed draco is that what you want not if i hide you think they wontfind you you an underage wizard running from voldemort do you know the types of tools he has at his disposal i breathed in it suicide to try and do this alone draco he stood quickly donteven consider it lexi there no way you re not doing this alone let me go with you i paused you think i want that type of life you donthave to do this you have time two years to plan and figure something out if i had that time i wouldntbe doing this but i don t he snapped you re not coming with me i wonthave you getting hurt lexi i not going to let you get yourself killed if you re going then i am too i threatened dontmake me wipe your memory draco said i could tell he was serious draco let me help please go to someone dumbledore always said his door was open for anyone i pleaded you re joking right he ll want me to join that ridiculous order and that ll put me in a more dangerous position than i in now he sat down i have to run at least until things cool down they ll never cool down you know running from the dark lord is a death wish it a lifetime of service i said quoting my mother he was silent while i thought adrian pucey i said what adrian pucey at your party he told me he wasntinto the death eater thing he said if i ever needed help to get in touch with him i paused at least if you found him you wouldntbe on your own i already talked to him i might lay low at his place until i can get to the u s draco said quietly he really did have this all planned out and that it huh i said quietly he was just leaving me behind i knew deep down this was what he had to do but i couldnthelp but be angry what about me draco what am i supposed to do on my own i asked when you leave the first person they ll come to is me i paused what do i do without my best friend draco pulled me into a hug you re going to learn occulmency with me and when it comes time for you to you know i ll come back for you we can keep in touch through pucey so that if anything happens i ll know there must be a better way i said you cantjust drop out of school there no other way you just arentthinking of anything else i was so angry you re saying this like it doesntbother you at all that you re leaving everything behind what do i have here lexi really draco asked angrily you have me i yelled how can you abandon me like this lex draco trailed off moving towards me no if you dontthink i important enough to even consider my feelings why should i care about yours i spun on my heel unlocked the door and left lexi draco called after me but i ignored him and went in search of blaise or cho or pansy or anyone but draco after searching the train for about 15 minutes my anger and impateience grew and i threw myself into an empty compartment i sprawled out on one of the seats and found myself drifting off soon enough when i awoke it was dark outside and i heard whispering across the compartment from me i looked up to find ginny weasley and loony lovegood sitting staring at me can i help you i asked sitting up and straightening my shirt out no loony replied we were just talking about what a shame it is that you and george broke up dontyou think it a shame she asked me i stared at her openmouthed are you seriously asking me that i rolled my eyes apparently insanity also makes you lose your tact calm down lexi luna would never be rude on purpose unlike some of your friends ginny rolled her eyes speaking of what got malfoys knickers in a twist he been looking all over for you i looked down at my hands of course i knew what was wrong with draco but no one else did or could know it really not your business i snapped immediately regretting it at the hurt look that passed ginny face fine excuse me being concerned i guess fred was right about poisonous toadstools they dontchange their spots ginny got up to leave luna following her fred fred has no right to say anything about me he knows nothing about me and neither do you for that matter it not my fault that i canttell you draco business i snapped back fred and i dontneed to know anything about you other than how happy you made george and how you broke his heart ginny said softly i closed my eyes ginny can you please just leave this is the last thing i want to talk about it annoyed me that ginny was the one who wanted to talk to me about george and i ginny and i werentclose it should be my close friends who wanted to talk to me about george but of course draco wouldntdo that he couldntcomprehend me being upset over someone like george not to mention draco apparently had his own problems to deal with in fact at the moment all i wanted to do was forget about my business with george and push it to the back of my mind the last thing i wanted was to be reminded of it as soon as i had decided to let go ginny nodded whatever you want she paused you know he still loves you i glared at her what did she want me to say what could i even say to that george had broken up with me there was nothing i could do to change the fact that he didntwant to be with someone like me get out i said quietly i heard ginny tsk and the door open and close and finally i was alone i sighed and leaned back on the seat everything was moving so fast around me and i didnthave time to think first george and i break up and now draco leaving i couldnthelp but feel utterly abandoned lexi knew i d find you blaise said opening the door you okay draco told us you guys had a fight didntsay about what though didntask he came and sat down next to me blaise you dontthink i stupid do you for being upset about george i paused i mean it just i probably being stupid blaise put an arm around me lex i dontthink it stupid to be upset i think you have a right to feel however you want what i do think is stupid is making yourself feel weak you need to be strong or else you know everyone will attack you i nodded he was right slytherins were notorious for kicking people when they were down and the rest of the houses thrived on a slytherin showing weakness you re right blaise i wontlet this get the best of me i sighed lex things will be okay you ll move on and realize that little weasley wasntworth your time anyway he paused look on the bright side at least you werentdating ron weasley i laughed trust me blaise you have full permission to kill me if i ever even think about liking weasel i sighed blaise you ll always be here right blaise gave me an odd look course lex you know draco and i will always be here to mop up your sorry ass i frowned as blaise mentioned draco blaiseeeee really i whined listen lexi you re my best friend you donteven have to ask me to be here i will promise blaise grinned like you could live without me i smiled back punching him lightly in the shoulder dontthink so highly of yourself zabini i could take care of myself you know we laughed together becuase at that time i think we both knew that if there was one thing i was not capable of doing it was being independent i didntsit by draco that night at dinner i didntsay a word to him the feeling was mutual i think our efforts received many weird looks from many of our housemates but no one said anything slytherins didntpry into the business of our own the other houses werentso kind it soon became common knowledge that a rift was growing for whatever reason between draco and i and everyone wanted to know why conrad what will you do now without malfoy answering your every beck and call a smart ass gryffindor 7th year asked me so this means malfoy single right a hufflepuff questioned draco and i would never date i snarled back as blaise led me to marketing class calm down lexi dontlet them get to you blaise paused maybe you should just talk to draco and draco can talk to me when he decides i important enough to be graced with his presence i said swiftly as we entered the classroom he a wreck without you you know blaise said i glanced over at draco he did look rather run down i sighed it wasntas though draco didnthave enough things to be stressed about what with his death eater dilemma and here i was adding to it when as his best friend i was supposed to be helping him in his time of need i sat down next to draco as a feeling of shame washed over me fred and george walked in and i felt my face heat up this wasntgoing to be fun time to present your final projects class fred announced cheerfully here the signup sheet sign on the day you want to present the sheet was passed around and cho signed our group up to present the following week okay so we ll be around to help you guys plan how to sell your product fred said and clapped his hands as everyone broke into their groups so guys blaise said awkwardly what do we want to do well obviously i dontcare enough about brooms to speak about them someone else can do that i said draco glanced up at me but i looked away he sighed cho and i could talk about them he said as george walked by without so much as a glance in our direction i looked down at my desk a ruckus from the other side of the room made us turn our heads we watched in amusement as granger and weasel bickered on about the manner of their presentation you know draco said loudly some of us are trying to work it a pity not everyone in our school can have the same sophistication that others have sod off malfoy weasley said good one weasel draco drawled please ferret boy no one wants to hear your voice granger snapped draco rolled his eyes but said nothing and neither did fred or george so i did granger please you act like you re worth even half of draco i snapped maybe if your parents had done a better job raising you you wouldnthave to rely on your little boyfriends and biased teachers to protect you conrad malfoy hermione cut it out fred said quickly certainly professor i wouldntwant to put your honesty and integrity into question with any unscrupulous behavior would i i said sweetly draco stifled a laugh the rest of class went on pleasantly enough with draco and i stealing grins at each other much to the annoyance of the gryffindors the bell finally rang and we gathered up our things let talk during lunch i said as we left the classroom we walked past the golden trio as draco threw an arm around my shoulders looks like the dull witted duo have regained their friendship granger pointed out sourly i turned and smirked at her fully aware that george was watching from the doorway sorry my guys friends are more attractive than yours granger i guess they just consider me better company than a homely girl such as yourself draco and i laughed as we walked away i knew subconsciously that saying something that like wouldntget me back in george good graces but i was far too happy to be speaking with draco to care of course it still upset me that he would be leaving me but he had to i knew and i was determined to enjoy the time i had with my best friend in all honesty i was terrified to lose him draco promise me we ll stay best friends even when you know i whispered as we walked down the hall promise lex he said giving my hand a squeeze and i glad you ve finally admitted how attractive i am i laughed you wish granger was right about one thing draco and i were friends again as if anything could keep us apart oh no haahahah so did you guys like this i think it may be a bit cheesey revieww okay so i decided that at the beginning of this chapter is going to be lexi kind of reflecting on the events that will happen in this chapter and some events that wonthappen for a few chapters oooh foreshadowing and this chapter is pretty short but that because i want to focus on what happened instead of it being a bunch of events in the same chapter thanks to the following reviewers xxxsour lemonxxx lightning86 hazeleyedhottie crea lilyjet silenceissilver last blue mage ilovegrednforgex0o emily melodiespunk lucyblue live2sk8 mavisclone skydancer389 midnightsprite chapter 27 an interlude of misery the period between the holidays christmas and easter of course was one that i can remember as being miserable at best i was miserable without george i was miserable at the thought of losing draco i was miserable with the snide remarks i received from the golden trio and the rest of the weasley at hogwarts despite this i put on a brave front that looking back i believe was as admirable as the courage of any gryffindor little did i know that after easter things were only going to get worse a lot worse they say that sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better for a while i was sure that i would never reach better and that i was being put into the permanent state of worse as some sort of sick punishment for all the times i d jinxed the hufflepuff books into attacking them at the library karma is a bitch as they say although the fact that draco would soon be forced to leave me made me want to crawl under a rock and become a hermit i did all i could to help him i may not like the thought of him leaving but i d be damned if he wasntgoing to be prepared so soon after arriving back at hogwarts draco and i began planning his escape it was during one of these brainstorming sessions that i had my worst weasley run in to date so if adrian is in france how do you expect to get there without alerting anyone i whispered in the library draco shrugged i dontknow i working on setting up a portkey placing me at the border of france from there i ll have to make my way to paris that completely unreliable the ministry tracks portkeys and no doubt your father has enough influence to find out where yours went to i paused i think your best bet would be muggle transport you ll be of age by the end of the year so the trace wontbe a problem muggle transport how in the bloody hell will that keep me safe draco asked incredulously well think of it you get off the hogwarts express somehow we ll have to make sure your father doesntsee you you can even set up to get on a train there and with the crowd it would be easy to lose yourself and oh i dontknow draco this all seems so impossible without any kind of help i threw up my hands in frustration how about this i ll owl pucey yes using the school owls and see if he cantset a portkey up with the french ministry then he could mail it to me and it would be out of the british ministry jurisdiction draco explained okay and this way you wonthave to arrive at the border you can arrive somewhere in or near paris somewhere that adrian can meet you i beamed draco nodded that would be nice he said thoughtfully let get out of here we ve accomplished a lot and i need to write to pucey and plan this before you figure anything else out i stood and stretched the library wasnthe most comfortable place in the world they really should think of putting recliners or couches in maybe then students would read more yeah i need to study for that charms exam on thursday we exited the library in silence we reached the end of the hall when i stopped suddenly draco continued for a few steps before noticing that i wasntthere and turned to face me lex you okay he asked i opened my mouth to respond but nothing came out it just so hard i finally got out draco what am i going to do without you i dontthink i can really take care of myself that well you ve always looked out for me draco approached me quickly and grabbed my hands lexi listen to me you re more than capable of taking care of yourself really i know i tend to well baby you a lot but i know that you can do things on your own and you wonthave any trouble defending yourself when i gone he paused of course until then i always going to be around to fend off any unsavory characters he smirked you re pretty unsavory yourself mister i smiled at him he shook his head and pulled me into a hug dontruin the moment lexi he scolded lightly i squeezed him tight i was so scared for him it wasntoften that someone could escape the dark lord and what draco was planning was extremely dangerous i squeezed my eyes closed and sighed you re going to give me grey hair draco we heard someone clearing their throat behind us i turn and saw a furious fred a scandalized golden trio and a very depressed looking george i groaned and detached myself from draco oh of all the bad timing in the world this does seem to happen quite a lot doesntit lex draco asked casually i glared at him not the time did he want to make me go grey early why doesntthis surprise me i heard fred mutter i felt like banging my head off the floor why why why there is nothing here to surprise you fred i ground out because there is nothing going on here doesntlook like that to me weasley piped in i stomped my foot well that because your an affection starved twit who considers a brief hug between friends as bad as an orgy i squeaked the last words of my outburst silence met this exclamation until draco snorted with laughter shut it malfoy weasley was instantly defensive draco grinned please weasley i not the one who has not so innocent thoughts every time i hug my best friend so many things happened at once after draco let the proverbial cat out of the bag to say that granger was shocked would be an understatement weasley face instantly flushed and he leapt toward draco potter instinctively held him back as the twins and i stood with our mouths hanging open draco just smirked at the chaos he had oh so intentionally caused i finally snapped out of my reverie draco i admonished granger shook her head and bit her lower lip unsure of what to say she speechless for once in her life granger is speechless draco laughed potter was still trying to restrain weasley but was obviously getting tired the twins were watching the argument like it was a tennis match draco i said warningly stepping in front of him placing my hand on his chest back it up a bit i dontreally know what happened next i can only assume that weasley broke away from potter and charged towards draco draco was busy looking at me and didntnotice and granger made an audible gasp as she saw weasley running towards us i turned at the sound and the next thing i knew i was on the floor a stream of blood coming from my nose what the fuck weasley i heard draco growl from above me i heard weasley sputter and mumble as he tried to think of an excuse draco launched himself at him and the next thing i knew potter was trying to pull them apart while draco muttered a stream of vulgarities about weasley and his mother i myself didntseem to be too concerned with the fact that my nose had just been broken my eyes widened my nose had been broken my eyes began to water despite my attempts to keep myself from crying everything became blurry around me conrad i saw someone moving in front of me conrad listen uhm are you okay granger she reached out touch my nose stop i snapped that hurts okay i felt someone grab my arm brilliant though you may be hermione we need to get her to the hospital wing george he lifted me up and i couldnthelp but lean my head against his chest as he carried me to the hospital wing i vaguely recall him telling fred to help potter with draco and weasley i cantbelieve this i heard granger as she walked alongside us i cantbelieve ronald would be so unbelievably stupid i whimpered as i tried breathing through my nose george looked down at me in concern and granger continued he broke her nose merlin how could he have broken her nose she paused oh if only i hadntmade so much noise then she wouldnthave turned around and and ickle ronniekins with his brilliant aim wouldnthit her in the back of the head instead and caused irreparable brain damage george finished either way he was a bloody moron damb righd i managed george raised an eyebrow but said nothing here we are we went in and after george explained what happened i was rushed over to the bed and given two potions one to fix my nose and one to replenish the blood that was now covering my robes madame pomfrey told me my voice would still sound a little funny as my nasal passageways healed completely but that i wouldnthave a hideous bump on my nose of anything thank merlin dis is jusd gread i muttered i looked up to find granger and george looking at me granger looked almost sympathetic and george was grinning whad it dot fuddy i exclaimed it actually is george said smiling which i guess i should ve been grateful that he wasntglaring or moping around and i guess i would ve been had his happiness not come at my expense gid out i commanded granger rolled her eyes listen conrad just sorry about ronald and i really hope you dontsound like that forever she said smugly because then it d be even more annoying to hear you than usual at last some normalcy i was admittedly freaked out by the civility that granger had showed me and was eager to be back to our regular sniping i obviously wasnta fan of change wadda borrow by brush grandger i asked with a slight smirk on my face she rolled her eyes and walked out george just stood there staring at me i looked down at my bed for a while until i saw a red droplet on my sheet oh doh i said i bleedeng george grabbed a tissue and handed it to me perching himself precariously on my bed after i had taken care of my nosebleed he spoke listen lexi i m sorry i hope you re not hurt too badly he said i looked up at him it felt like he was burning holes into my face but i had missed getting to look at his so much recently that i didntreally mind does by nose look disgusdeng i asked quietly he smiled slightly and brushed a strand of hair away from my face i felt myself shiver i hadntbeen this close to george since well i pushed the memory out of my mind nah you re just as cute as ever my eyes widened as he said this and a moment later his did as well lexi i george was cut of by the sound of a door slamming open he stood quickly and i looked down trying hard to quell the furious blush that was rising from my neck onto my face lexi blaise skidded into the room what in the bloody hell happened he saw george and his eyes narrowed what did your neanderthal of a brother do to her he snapped george rubbed the back of his neck well uh now that someone else is here to watch you i guess i can leave he glanced over to me then back at blaise sorry again conrad conrad i rolled my eyes in anger how could he go from the dare i say moment we had just had to being so formal and uncaring in less than 30 seconds whadeber i sniffed but regretted it as a pain shot through my nose gid out george looked pleadingly at me but i was resolved if he couldntdefend me in front of his friends or even act like he wanted to talk to me in front of mine there was no way i was giving him the time of day i may have just gotten my ass kicked by a weasley but i would be damned if i lost every shred of dignity i had to that family blaise sat down and began fussing over me i smiled comforted by his concern but a sigh escaped me i couldnthelp but wonder what would ve happened had blaise only come a few minutes later when i arrived back in the common room you d have sworn i was a returning prisoner of war everyone had heard about weasley misguided and ill aimed attack on draco as well as draco courageous defending of my honor all i wanted to do was rest i quickly found draco sitting on a couch he looked up smiling in relief as he saw me i would ve visited you but i ve been confined to the common room draco muttered that my punishment house arrest all weekend i smiled sympathetically i sure we ll find something to do i said comfortingly we he asked i shrugged well it seems only right doesntit that i stay in here with you when it was me you were defending in the first place right i smiled at him leaning my head on his shoulder he was quick to wrap his arm around me allowing me a more comfortable position to rest if you say so he smiled now get some rest i ll keep the well wishers away i yawned as i began to drift off to sleep you better i didntget to see the results of draco fight with weasley until he next morning at breakfast draco accompanied me as he was allowed to leave the common room to eat i glanced over at the gryffindor table and saw weasley sporting more than a few bruises on his face draco i gasped i hadntreally thought their fight was that serious well you know no one hurts my best friend and gets away with it i smiled at the sheepish expression on draco face going soft eh malfoy i asked as we sat he smirked you wish conrad he bumped my elbow off the table hey i exclaimed he snickered and i rolled my eyes typical i glanced up at the teachers table and saw george and fred talking animatedly to professor flitwick i sighed it seemed that no matter what happened there was always going to be something ruining anything between george and i i also knew that i had other more pressing matters on my mind than trivial school relationships like draco predicament for example i pushed all thoughts of george to the back of my mind determined that i would worry about draco well being before i worried about the wreckage that was my relationship with george lexi i finished so i ll meet you in the common room draco asked okay draco i almost done eating i replied he nodded and walked off i took my time in finishing my breakfast and left soon after as i was exiting the hall i saw granger exit as well she bit her lip like she wanted to say something but instead walked towards the library i shrugged and continued on until i heard someone calling my name lexi lexi wait i turned and saw george running towards me looking anxious i sucked in a breath and waited for him to speak you you re feeling better yeah he asked i nodded pretty much i paused and i can actually speak in an intelligible fashion now so that always a good thing yeah yeah it is he said and then there was silence awkward so lexi george started i bit my lower lip yes i was thinking i know we didn t end on the best terms he said as i fought the urge to roll my eyes but i want us to be friends and i hope you know i don t i dontlike the way my brother treats you you know and definitely not that he ah he trailed off hauled off and punched me in the face i supplied helpfully george rolled his eyes but i saw a small grin creeping onto his face yeah anyway i just yeah you know george shrugged you know me lexi i not good with all this stuff i smiled george definitely wasntthe most eloquent speaker when it came to his emotions i sighed and thought for a moment george i have to be honest i really dontknow i paused i dontknow that we could ever really be friends you know what i mean it was the truth i couldntbe friends with george without wanting more than that and that was something i felt sure i wouldnthave for a while it just so hard you know i continued and there so much that i have to deal with right now and i just dontthink it the time for us to try and figure out what we can be if anything at all but i would really appreciate some type of civility between us especially since you re my teacher i looked up at him yeah civility george nodded he looked like someone had just told him his puppy died he turned around to leave see you around conrad i closed my eyes i felt like i should say something anything i knew i should apologize but for what exactly i wasntsure but i couldntbring myself to say sorry to george and i didntknow why i guess it all boiled down to my stupid pride i leaned against the wall and one of the paintings near me spoke it was a painting of an old woman reading a potions book misery loves company my dear and by the looks of it you re a wonderful hostess the woman said i shrugged in agreement the way i was going it didntlook like misery would be checking out of my hotel anytime soon gaaaah hahaha sorry this took so long i was having major writers block and just so you know you may see a little romance pop up between lexi and someone not draco but someone because i cantvery well have her fall madly in love with george without dating someone else can i or else how would she know exactly how amazing he is hmmm exactly as always reviews are appreciated you all did such an amazing job of reviewing last chapter it made me so happy you re all going to hate me for this on the plus side there a tiny bit of lexi george in this one despite the fact that they re both morons thanks to everyone who reviewed i d thank you all individually but my internet is being really slow and i just want to get this out as soon as possible sorry chapter 28 hogsmeade disaster and denial i didnthave much time to be unhappy in the following weeks easter was coming up and we were finalizing the plans of draco escape we were both adequate as far as occulmency was concerned and for that i was glad adrian had the portkey set up by the french government and sent it to draco it was a small chained necklace that would activate as soon as the hogwarts express arrived at the station this would give draco no time to be spotted by lucius my part in the plan was to go directly to my parents telling them draco had agreed to bring my luggage to me when he got his we d wait there for a while until my parents as well as draco s finally got irritated and went to look for him we would simply find my luggage with a note from draco confessing his plan this was so most suspicion would be thrown from me a hogsmeade trip had been announced for the weekend before easter presumably to allow students to shop for whatever presents or supplies they may need before the end of the year draco and i agreed to go together and try and get most of what draco would need to survive you ll need a new owl i muttered to him one day at breakfast i eyed his eagle owl with disdain and perhaps one that isnt so recognizable draco looked offended i ll have you know that this breed of owl is as much a part of my family as i am exactly draco if you re leaving you cantbe shouting your surname from the mountaintops as i know you like to throw your weight around i whispered you cant be a malfoy anymore after you leave at least until this whole mess is over we both glanced over at potter as much as we d never admit it we both knew scarhead was really our only hope if ending this war is left up to him draco sniffed then we are in for a very long wait draco come on we donthave all day and i want to be back in time for dinner i called from the common room blaise had already left for his date with cho and the common room was being shared by myself and a bunch of younger students dontget your knickers in a twist lex we ve got plenty of time draco said as he came into the room fastening his robes i sighed as i went to join him it was a warm day so i wasntwearing any robes unlike draco who seemed to be perpetually cold let just go i said impatiently it almost seems like you dontwant to spend time with me lexi have a hot date draco teased i laughed but felt my face heat up i ve sworn off men draco i joked darn right you have he replied holding out his arm i took it and we walked towards the carriages that would take us to hogsmeade we arrived in hogsmeade and saw that mostly everyone had taken advantage of the trip as the village was packed with people where do you want to go first i asked as we were shoved through the crowd draco kept a close hold on me i need a new cloak draco said one that isntso obviously malfoy i suggested he nodded off to gladrag s then we went into the store looking for a cloak that wasntso sophisticated we managed to get draco a simple grey wool cloak which was incidentally much less expensive than we had originally estimated we then went to the stationary store to buy draco new parchment and quills other than the ones his parents had gotten him draco wanted to be careful that nothing he would take with him could be traced back to his family and in turn lead them to him why dontyou get this parchment draco i pointed out a lovely type of parchment with a puppy dog border draco snorted lexi we re going for inconspicuous not completely tacky he sniffed you re right who would get parchment like this anyway i asked laughing our eyes met and we both exclaimed at the same time pansy we laughed as we bought draco some plain parchment and non descript black ink you know being incognito isntas glamorous as books might make it appear plain robes and cloaks and parchment you re going to be pretty bland draco i teased draco rolled his eyes let get some lunch he said i nodded and we headed towards the three broomsticks we ate our lunch quietly for the most part buying draco his things made the whole situation seem so real it was hard to think that in less than two months he would be leaving and i would be left alone i gonna miss you you know i said quietly he reached across the table and squeezed my hand quickly before replying you know i ll miss you too lex draco said trying to smile what if you get caught draco what if they ask me and they figure it out what if they make me tell them i asked worry evident in my voice lexi dontworry i trust you and besides hopefully the letter will throw them off for a while at least long enough for me to plan where to go after adrian s draco tried to reassure me i guess and i am getting better at occulmency right i asked as draco paid for our meal ever the gentleman much better he sad honestly i grinned feeling better as we set off towards a little owl emporium on the outskirts of town we opened the door and were first greeted by the musty smell which was to be expected i guess draco and i hurried in not wanting to be spotted or bothered by any of our friends remember draco the owl needs to be common i reminded him he nodded i know lexi we searched through the various owls obviously disregarding any unusual breeds or colors draco finally settled on a medium sized tawny owl he paid for it and arranged to have it delivered to the school since carrying an owl up to hogwarts would be very suspicious as we stepped out into the village it began to rain i shrieked and wrapped my arms around myself not having brought a cloak draco on the other hand took his off and offered it to me thanks i said as we walked towards the village as the shop we were at was on the edge of town kind of near the shrieking shack it was pretty deserted as we walked suddenly we heard voices on the other side of the street i glanced quickly and saw three cloaked figures standing with their back to us draco paled and shoved my into an alley shit draco swore they saw me he continued shoving me down the alley until we came to a small broom shed outside one of the old shops he opened it and shoved me inside draco what going on i asked as he took his necklace the portkey off and gave it to me lexi promise me promise no matter what happens that you will stay in this shed draco whispered urgently i dontunderstand i he cut me off we donthave time for this he pulled his wand out and silenced me i opened my mouth to protest but nothing came out lexi please i m i sorry i love you lexi more than anything you re my best friend he pressed a quick kiss to my forehead before shutting the shed door and latching it i searched along the door and finally found a reasonably sized hole so that i could look and see what was going on i was confused shocked and more than anything worried i saw draco standing in the middle of the alley the three cloaked figures approaching him he tried to look nonchalant but i could tell as only best friends can that he was nervous as the figures reached him and lowered their hood i recognized draco father and rudolphus lestrange as well as my own father i realized instantly by the looks on their face as well as draco s what had happened they figured it out they knew draco was going to run it was all terrifyingly clear to me now but i couldntbring myself to do anything i was petrified with worry draco his father said icily father draco tried to sound as casual as possible i stifled a gasp which i immediately after realized was silenced anyway as lucius leaned over and smacked his son right in the face how dare you lucius stated how dare you call me father how dare you think that you could possibly be my son i ve given my son everything draco everything and here you are ready to throw it back in my face no son of mine would do this lucius reached for his cane pulling his wand out crucio i d never seen anyone being tortured before draco fought the urge to scream but the look of pain that was etched into his face as he crumpled to the ground chilled me to the bone what terrified me even more was the cold and disconnected way lucius had said it like it didntfaze him at all that he was torturing someone much less his son it was sickening i dontknow how long lucius held the first crucio on draco but it seemed like an eternity for me lucius eventually lowered his wand but draco remained on the ground breathing heavily get up lucius snapped you filthy blood traitor my father and rudolphus had moved to form a circle around draco my eyes widened in fear i had heard about what had happened to alice and frank longbottom why draco rudolphus asked why would you betray us your family like this draco didntanswer was alexis involved in this my father asked sharply i sucked in a breath draco shakily stood lexi knows nothing about this he said evenly his father regarded him for a minute then nodded just as well although the girl does seem to have an odd type of affection for you pity she ll be devastated he then performed the curse again sending draco back tot he ground this one was shorter and i willed draco to stay on the ground after but he got to his feet again and see where it gotten you draco do you see what your treachery has earned you where are your friends now where are those who share your filthy muggle loving views they certainly arenthere draco they arenthere to protect you now lucius words cut into me like ice he was right someone should be here where was a teacher or a villager why wasntanyone stopping this have you gone to dumbledore draco have you pledged your allegiance to him did he promise you protection and redemption and everything that you donthave right now lucius was taunting him now i didntgo to dumbledore draco answered you re lying lucius spat and all three men cried crucio at the same time this time draco cried out but the rain and thunder drowned it out what did you tell him draco lucius shouted nothing draco yelled in pain what did you tell him lucius roared nothing he told him nothing i screamed and screamed but nothing came out i tried opening the broom shed to no avail the curse was lifted momentarily as lucius approached draco such a disappointment he said softly i could barely heard him but you will serve a purpose whether you want to or not he said decidedly what do you mean draco asked his breathing ragged and his voice cracking i bit my lower lip so hard i drew blood but i couldntconcentrate on anything other than the scene before me i lost the ability to move well when they find you who do you think will be blamed certainly not me lucius explained in a scarily calm tone a horrifying thought struck me lucius malfoy would not he would not kill his own son you re going to kill me then draco asked lucius laughed oh no draco i dontthink your mother could handle that but you will be indisposed and the blame will certainly fall on the muggleborn community jealous i should say of your heritage and your right to wield magic i gasped lucius obviously not hearing me went on you see now draco that you ve chosen the wrong team he turned and walked a few steps before turning back to his son his wand drawn and for that you will pay dearly i dontknow how long they stood there taking turns torturing draco it may have been as little as 10 minutes it may have been as much as an hour all i know is that i stood there rooted to the spot and watched as three grown men tortured my best friend to the point where he couldnteven move i willed myself to move to pound on the door and get their attention away from draco to do anything to give him a moment of peace from the onslaught but i couldntmake myself move it was like i was frozen in horror and disgust at the sight before me the three men eventually left and after i heard them apparate away it was like my brain began to function again i pounded wildly on the door to the shed and screamed for someone to let me out a n okay so i assuming that the spell on lexi would be lifted since draco is now unconscious i know if hbp it was because dumbledore died but i would assumed it would be the same in this case since draco is now incapable of casting spells now however it was a long time before anyone heard me and even then i think it was more because of the search party the school had sent out in search of us i heard someone approach and heard them yell as they saw draco i found one of them professor i heard a female voice say help open the door i shouted as i slammed myself against the door i heard footsteps come towards me and the latch on the door unclasp the door opened to reveal the pink haired witch from draco party she looked at me in shock as she pulled me out of the shed draco i looked past her at my best friend he was in a heap on the ground he was so pale his lips were blue and i could see some blood on the side of his head my eyes widened and i froze in shock draco i said softly no no no no the pink haired witch tonks shook me slightly fred george i found them both she yelled i heard footsteps charging towards me no no no i kept repeating it barely registered in my brain when the twins approached bloody hell one of them said looking at draco they turned their attention to me lexi shit i blinked draco i began breathing heavily no i draco no the twins looked bewildered lexi someone touched my arm lexi we need to get you out of here draco i said not moving my eyes from his form tonks was now conjuring a stretcher for him i heard other people approaching professor you re here draco unconscious he has signs of having been hit with crucio repeatedly it not it not looking good tonks said my breathing quickened draco i couldntmove i saw dumbledore move into my vision what about miss conrad he asked peering at me i looked past him and continued staring at the spot draco had been at tonks had fred lead him away on the stretcher i i dontknow professor she wontanswer any of us i heard george say she was locked in the broom shed over there professor tonks said uneasily she keeps muttering things probably in shock i heard dumbledore say it didntreally register at the time that they were talking about me she ll start hyperventilating soon if we dontget her sedated at least until we can get to the hospital wing i afraid mister malfoy will need to be transported immediately to st mungo to be stabilized draco st mungo s stabilized not looking good no i said forcefully no i said louder no no no no no i shouted lexi it okay you re okay george said trying to calm me dumbledore pulled out his wand we will have to put her on a stretcher and in this state it will be better for her to be put into a dreamless sleep until we can have madame pomfrey check her over i saw dumbledore wave his wand at me i heard him mutter some words but all i could think about was draco and then everything was black when i woke up i sat up quickly thrashing around in my sheets lexi you re awake a voice said next to me i looked over to see george as my memories floated back to me my panic increased draco where is draco i asked frantically george looked down where is he george tell me he he at st mungo s george said quietly he in a coma right now but he stable he s he going to make it but the healer dontknow i when they dontknow when he ll wake up if he was going to say if if he woke up i shook my head he going to wake up i said quietly he has to he has to wake up george looked at me sadly he will lexi he got up to leave i reached my hand out and grabbed his george i said my lip trembling please dontleave me i dontwant to be alone not right now george hesitated i dontknow lexi george please i just i don t i took a huge breath i donthave anyone anymore not with draco not when he s not here george sighed and sat you need to get some rest you ve been through a traumatic experience there was no way i could sleep none at all draco was gone he was hurt i let him get hurt this was all my fault i stared up at the ceiling and allowed my thoughts to swallow me whole that was until madame pomfrey burst in and insisted i take some horrid potion to sleep i normally would ve protested but i didnteven have the energy for that i could barely taste the awful potion as it went down my throat i was numb the only thing i remember was falling asleep clutching george hand i was released from the hospital wing the next day with very simple instructions dontdo anything strenuous too bad even the smallest thing seemed an extraordinary task i didntfeel like doing anything eating showering homework even moving i told dumbledore everything i could manage and the story he gathered was that draco recognized his attackers locked me in the shed to protect me and i was left there with draco for about an hour after his attackers left this put me into a state of shock and accounted for my behavior i didnttell dumbledore that i also recognized his attackers as well as the reason why draco was attacked he didntask maybe he thought i would ve said something had i known maybe he just didntcare enough to ask i couldntbring myself to feel any emotion other than anger at the situation angry at myself for letting them hurt draco angry at draco for getting caught angry at lucius for torturing his own son angry at my father angry at dumbledore for not being able to protect his students from from what his own parent i shoved everything out of my head and instead buried myself in my schoolwork for the following two weeks i scribbled notes down in class i did extra credit i wrote out summaries of chapters in history of magic it was the only way i had to cope and forget blaise didntknow what to do with me he tried as hard as he could to be supportive but it was hard for him when i wouldnttalk about anything our house took it hard and as lucius predicted blamed the muggleborns most people in our house wanted to blame potter and his friends i didntcorrect them if i had to suffer i wanted them to suffer to i looked at the gryffindors with more loathing than i ever had they never had to worry like draco did they ve never had to work to be good or do what was right they were automatically given help and assistance in everything while draco was left to defend himself against three men far more skilled then he was professor snape was naturally the first to grow concerned with my behavior it was in potions class when i was working alone but writing out two sets of notes that he paused and asked what i was doing taking notes for draco sir he ll want them when he gets back i replied simply snape shot me an unreadable look then nodded and walked away after class he called for me to stay behind miss conrad he began i know you ve partnered with mister malfoy for most of the year but do to recent events and the fact that you are as of now without a partner i find it best that you join another group for anymore brewing we do i bit my lower lip but nodded only until draco gets back though he wontwant to be left without a partner snape shot me that look again but nodded and i left i was sliding down the slippery slope of denial and it soon became obvious to everyone i was sitting at breakfast two days later with blaise beside me and pansy across from me draco seat on my other side remained unoccupied as it had been since he left that was until damien sat down next to me and struck up a quiet conversation with pansy i looked at him in shock he looked back at me after a few minutes what he asked you re sitting in draco seat i said simply damien looked around uncomfortably well yeah i know but he he isnthere lexi damien said but it still his seat i insisted you cantjust take his seat where will he sit when he gets back damien looked at me lexi i scoffed fine you can sit there but when draco gets back he ll be wanting his seat back okay blaise and pansy were looking down at their plates damien swallowed but nodded okay lexi i nodded quietly and continued buttering my toast not that it did any good anyway seeing as everything tasted like ash i was called to dumbledore office the following afternoon it was a saturday so when i stepped in and saw all of my teachers standing there with him i didntwonder about their classes welcome miss conrad please have a seat i sat in a chair in front of dumbledore desk i looked around at mcgonagall snape flitwick hagrid vector and to my surprise fred and george why did you call me here professor i asked with as much curiosity as i could muster miss conrad alexis dumbledore said gently lexi i automatically corrected lexi then he paused we ve been growing concerned over your behavior these past weeks i looked to the ground oh you professor have been noticing a distance in your mannerisms they also say you ve taken to copying two sets of notes he said this part hesitantly for draco i said immediately he ll want to get caught up dumbledore sighed lexi it is admirable that you want to help draco like this but this is an unhealthy way of coping we feel that you re ignoring the event and there may be a chance that draco wontwake soon or at all and you need to acknowledge that i sucked in a breath he will i know he will he wouldn t yes dumbledore pressed he wouldntleave me like that he wouldn t i insisted lexi everyone copes with grief differently your way is to ignore it but you have to come to terms with what has happened and the longer you put it off the harder it will be it is okay to be upset dumbledore said i could feel his eyes on me and i lifted my gaze to his it not okay i said in a small voice nothing okay it wasntsupposed to be like this be like what lexi dumbledore asked this isnthow it was supposed to turn out i continued lexi do you know something about the attack on mister malfoy dumbledore asked draco i corrected his name is draco draco i paused i i was supposed to help him i promised him he wouldn t be alone i looked down at my feet help him with what lexi dumbledore asked and my head snapped up help him escape i exclaimed escape dumbledore paused lexi do you know who attacked draco he asked his voice stern i was angry suddenly this was dumbledore fault as much as mine or anyone else s if dumbledore hadntmade us seem liekt he enemy draco might ve gone to him for help as if you dontknow i sneered i don t he replied draco i started again he was supposed to become a death eater you know at the end of the school year i did not know that dumbledore said and he did look surprised well i paused he he didntwant to you know he said he couldn t couldntjust kill people didntwant to be like i drew in a shaky breath like his father so draco did not want to become a death eater did he tell his parents this dumbledore asked but i think he already knew the answer he was going to run away after the end of the year i wanted to go too but i cast a look around the room but he wouldntlet me so i said i d help we we planned everything i fingered the necklace i had yet to take off even the portkey and so draco attackers dumbledore trailed off someone must ve seen us or heard us or something someone must ve figured it out i paused talking more to myself at this point but they didntknow i knew they asked him if i knew and he said no the only thing i had time to think about between my schoolwork and sleeping was who had figured out draco plans i couldntcome up with anything definite anything that remotely made sense in any way who asked lexi dumbledore said sharply did you know them yes i said in my mind no i heard myself saying i i didntrecognize them they kept their hoods up and it was thundering hard to hear why was i lying in some twisted part of my mind lucius malfoy wasntthe monster who i had seen torture his son he was still the lucius that i had known all my life and my father my own father i couldn t bring myself to give them up so you are saying draco was attacked becuase he didntwish to join the dark lord dumbledore asked they they thought he went to you i said quietly dumbledore sighed i wish he would have i gripped the arms of the chair i was sitting in that all you care about huh the information he could ve given you i asked coldly i heard mcgonagall gasp and dumbledore looked strained lexi i merely meant that i could have protected him dumbledore explained gently but i cut him off no you know what no maybe draco would ve gone to you if you would ve made him feel like he could trust you i snapped lexi please i have done everything in my power to make every student here feel as though they can confide in me dumbledore began bullshit i whispered miss conrad that is quite enough i heard snape say but i ignored him my heart was beating so loudly i could hear it i felt like i was going to be sick and i had the sudden urge to break albus dumbledore nose you have never once made any of the slytherins at this school feel like we could come to you with any problem maybe if you d taken one damned second of your time and attention away from your precious gryffindors and your savior potter to make us feel like we werentthe black sheep of hogwarts maybe then i d believe you but every single thing you have ever done or said towards us or dealing with my house has done nothing to make us feel like we re merely tolerated at this school but certainly not wanted i hissed miss conrad i assure you that was not my i cut him off again not only have your actions said that but the way you let the other houses gang up on us no wonder we re so aggressive towards everyone you would be too if you felt like you had to fight for your right to even be in this building i said my voice increasing in volume miss conrad i wonthave you yelling at the headmaster snape tried again but i putt my hand up to him you say you would ve helped draco but at what price you wouldnthave trusted him and neither would any of your rag tag freedom fighters face it this entire school had draco branded as a death eater from the start yourself included and nothing would ve changed that no matter how good draco was he would never be good enough for you for any of you i looked around the room miss conrad dumbledore looked older than i had ever seen him i am truly sorry if my actions have made you or your housemates feel alienated i assure you though that any of them who would wish to come to me with problems will not be judged or have their sincerity doubted well it a little too late for that isntit professor i said icily your apologies cantmake draco better and i dontwant to hear it because i dontbelieve it i stood and walked towards the door i tried to open it but it was locked let me out i growled miss conrad we need to talk about your method of dealing with this situation dumbldore reminded me and i snapped what what do you want me to say dumbledore my best friend was tortured into a coma he might not ever wake up i completely alone i donthave anyone that will ever mean to me what draco did are you happy is this how you want me to deal with this situation as you call it because that all it is to you huh a situation well draco is a hell of a lot more to me than a situation so i sorry if i dontwant to listen to your lies about how you wish you could ve done more you didntdo anything to help you never do anything to help i finished now let me leave the lights in the room began to flicker and a small silver instrument on dumbledore desk shattered miss conrad dumbledore stood and walked towards me stay away from me i yelled and was as surprised as everyone else when dumbledore flew back a few feet he almost fell against his desk but caught himself looking at me in surprise i i i looked around at the faces looking at me snape looked livid but also had another emotion in his eyes mcgonagall vector flitwick and hagrid were shocked and mcgonagall looked the most sympathetic of them all fred was looking at me as though i had two heads george george just looked devastated just let me leave please i said quietly i dontwant to talk about this anymore i heard the lock on the door behind me click and i left quickly i hurried down the stairs and leaned against the wall in the hallway leading to dumbledore office i tried to calm myself but only found myself getting more upset draco might not wake up he had to wake up i couldntget the image of him out of my head in a heap on the ground so pale i closed my eyes and promised myself i would never be a death eater never i would never to what i had seen them do that day i would never forgive them even my own father for what they did to draco

but i ve always felt sort of bad for him i not too much into the main characters since their personalities are so solid and pre made thank you so much all of my reviewers disclaimer nothing you recognize from books 1 6 are mine they are jkr s chapter 3 train rides i always loved the train rides to hogwarts mostly because you could use magic and not get in trouble for doing something slighty inappropriate not that i would ever do such a thing so pansy draco and i comfortably situated ourselves in a compartment and then pansy and draco went to the prefects meeting both promising me one good quip directed towards granger so i was alone well lexi looks like you are officially on your own i said to myself than started singing nobody likes me everybody hates me why donti go eat worms i really wish i knew the rest of this song but i dontso that sucks i was sinking into a severe state of boredom just then my savior opened the door to the compartent oh sorry ginny weasley said i was looking for someone else some savior geesh s alright red no harm done i mumbled trying to count the number of dots on the seat cushion quickly slipping back into my near comatose state well is there anyone sitting here she asked not at the moment but i am sitting with malfoy so you can sit here for a bit but you d proabably want to leave before he gets back i said not looking up fifty five fifty six well alright i just need someone to talk to while my friends are in their prefect meeting she sat across from me seventy seventy one so whats you re name she asked lexi conrad but dontworry i know you you re the miny wealsey miny wealsey she laughed ninety seven i put my finger on the dot and looked up ginny then i said she grinned i ve seen you hanging out with george he mentioned you once or twice i shrugged not so much little one what do you mean see he doesntlike me anymore since he found out i a slytherin you know the usual blah blah blah i made a talking motion with my hand she frowned you seem alright to me i grimaced only cause you ve caught me inh a lazy mood miny ginny she rolled her eyes well thats better than miny weasley i half shrugged it rhymes but seriously if he caught you conversing with me boy would you get a stern talking to no one gives me a stern talking to except my mother ginny said defiantly i grinned and sat up keeping my finger on the dot arentyou just the little spitfire you could put it that way she said indifferently i chuckled no you definately arentmuch like your brothers you still dontseem that bad oh but i am quite evil in fact wouldntwant to run into me in a dark alley no sir i rolled my eyes so george stopped talking to you when he foudn out you were a slytherin i nodded quite funny really got a bit angry and stomped on some of his joke shop stuff ginny gasped so thats what ron was sweeping up when i came in i laughed yeah none of them seemed too pleased with me oh well george can be a prat though he ll come around ginny said confidently i scoffed why would i care if he came around he was an aquaintance nothing more ginny smiled well he thought you were pretty cute i grinned dontblame him there probably the smartest thing he ever thought in his life guys can be such idiots amen to that speaking of one of the said idiots should be getting here shortly you d better go little one i only a year younger than you i smiled and boy doesntit suck when i rub it in ginny stuck her tongue out and looked out the compartment door he coming pansy too i groaned let me handle it you sneak out while i distract them i went out the door draco pansy while you were gone i got a visit from potter seems he was looking for the little weasley girl i think we ought to pay him a visit eh draco nodded let get crabbe and goyle i grabbed both his and pansy arms and steered them away from the cmopartment let not we ve been lucky this long maybe they ve missed the train i added hopefully turning my head i saw ginny leaving the compartment adn we grinned at each other as she walked away well if it isntthe golden trio i said happily walking in and sitting next to potter weasley and granger were across from us and all of them wore faces somewhere between shock and anger boy you guys sure are lacking in the manners department i said offhandedly what can you expect lexi draco drawled from the doorway they re practically sub human pansy and i laughed what do you want malfoy potter growled i patted potter leg no worries dollface we re just here to meet and greet and perhaps trade an insult or two i added a thoughtful look on my face look lexi why dontyou be a good little snake and take pansy and ferret boy out of here granger asked ferret boy pansy shook her head that is so fourth year i shook my head as well so tell me malfoy how much gold did it take for your dad to get out of jail this time potter asked none my father got off on a technicality draco smirked sure weasley muttered under his breath weasel you d better watch yourself that mouth of yours is going to get you into trouble pansy said i so scared weasley said sarcastically you guys should be the ones watching yourselves why draco scoffed or is the big bad weasel going to make things hard for us i just might ron said lifting his chin in the air i shook my head dontmake promises you cantkeep ronny draco has yet to eat those slugs you offered him in second year i bored draco lexi let ditch these freaks pansy whined yeah lex this is getting pretty predicable but what else can we expect from people like this draco agreed i nodded yeah as much as i d love to stay i sure we ll see more of each other during the year potty weasel granger i smirked at granger and we left another year you guys only one more then we re free pansy said as we walked to our compartment i looked at the ground i knew i wouldntbe free when i graduated if anything i would be more confined then i was now i wouldnthave any choices in what was best for me or even what i wanted i would be told what to do think and want not to mention the hideous tatoo i would have to wear yeah should be great i replied half heartedly after finding our compartment we talked about a lot of stuff what we did over the summer what classes we had this year and we also talked about a lot of students crabbe and goyle joined us when the trolley lady went by i guess they had followed her the entire train until coming to our compartment they being so large sat on one side of our compartment and pansy draco and i sat opposite them has anyone seen blaise i asked crankily my mood had taken a nosedive since the moron brigade had joined us no draco said i saw him when we came in but haventseen him since pansy answered two grunts sounded across from me crabbe goyle i do not know what ugg grunt or hmph means i dontspeak caveman would you care to explain i snapped haventseen him crabbe still grunted me either goyle said sounding a bit more human i slumped back in my seat and looked out the window draco glanced at me but i glared back my look clearly saying this is all your fault i stood up suddenly well i going to find him i walked quickly into the hallway i stood for a moment not sure which way to go finally deciding to go down the train i set off i ran into a group of 4th year ravenclaws 7th year hufflepuffs 2nd year slytherins and a large group of first years finally though i found blaise he was sitting with shirley squires theodore nott and damien somers draco piss you off again blaise asked as i sat down next to him not him so much as the company he keeps i replied crabbe and goyle shirley asked from my left i nodded why didntpansy come with you nott asked you know pansy she ll endure anything if it means extra time with draco damien said i laughed it was true pansy did fawn over draco thats fine he ll get tired of them soon enough i said sitting next to blaise blaise was the only other guy in the slytherin house that i could say i was close to apart from draco we d gotten along well since 1st year but around 3rd year we started talking to one another more since we both had ancient runes and really hit it off so how was your summer i asked looking up at him not bad he said squeezing my arm relaxed after owls i swear i slept an entire week how about you you take a very long after owl slumber hmmm afraid not no rest for the wicked i suppose what classes you taking i asked transfiguration charms defense potions ancient runes he said same except i taking herbology instead of runes looks like you ll have to find a new test to cheat off of i smirked i going to be a healer i sure you ll be brilliant and i never once copied your paper blaise told me giving me a mock glare i grinned better go get draco i said standing up he can ride in a carriage up to the school with us pansy as well that makes four oh thats something i want to see before i eat pansy trying to swallow draco whole blaise muttered but stood up with me as well we reached the compartment i had left draco and pansy in to find them sitting as far away as possible go change guys pansy and i will stay in here i said ushering them out whats wrong pansy you and drakey wakey have a fight i said pulling my robes out of my trunk not exactly but i couldntexactly do anything in here with them sitting there staring could i pansy said putting extra emphasis on them yeah well plently more chances during the year i pulled my robes on but i feel so bad lexi if i with draco who will you be with i dontwant to do anything to push you out pansy whined shutting her trunk dontworry i ll find someone i replied knowing perfectly well that pansy would shove me off a cliff if it meant a bit of alone time with draco she was that infatuated with him i dontthink draco would be turned on by the sight of me falling into an endless abyss i hope not anyways blaise maybe that would be perfect then we could double date pansy said excitedly no actually i was thinking more along the lines of harry potter i said sarcastically changing the subject i never felt comfortable mentioning that i was lacking in the boyfriend department i suppose i could probabaly get one if the only reason i wanted one was so that i could be with someone but none of the guys at hogwarts had that click with me the only two i felt remotely attracted to thought of me as nothing more than a sister ewww even sarcastically thats so wrong pansy squealed launching into her rant of why none of the gryffindor guys were worth looking at twice draco blaise crabbe and goyle came in as pansy was wrapping up her rant blaise and draco sat on both sides of me and crabbe and goyle sat next to pansy so pansy you me blaise and draco are all sitting in a carriage right i asked yes of course she replied that cool with everyone right i asked smiling sweetly at crabbe and goyle sorry but you guys will have to have a carriage by yourselves but i sure we ll meet up at the feast by the way who quidditch captain blaise asked draco smirked smugly and showed us all his new badge congrats draco i said giving him a hug why didntyou tell me sooner he grinned wanted to surprise you with the rest of them potter gryffindor quidditch captain blaise informed us i scoffed potter only captain because he had to be given something to make him feel special right i mean look granger and weasley are prefect potter quidditch captain anyone with eyes can see how the staff favors the golden trio agreement was muttered throughtout the compartment we felt the train pull to a stop and hurried to get a carriage it was a clear night and the moon was a small sliver in the dark sky blaise draco pansy and i ran to the nearest carriage grabbing it before a bunch of hufflepuff second years got it climbing in i sat next to pansy with draco and blaise across from us well guys here we are again are you ready to start our preparation for newts i asked looking out the window i guess it ll just be another school year pansy shurgged draco shook his head no this my friends is the beginning of the end of our school career i smiled well then we d better make it one hell of an ending we walked into the great hall seeing the familiar sight of the opening feast we went to the slytherin table taking seats facing every other table hoping that our classmates particularly the gryffindors could give us some entertainment wonder who the new defense teacher will be draco said i scanned the table my eyes falling on an unfamiliar face sitting next to professor snape was a witch of about medium height and what some would call pleasantly plump she had a round face with dark brown eyes and a tan complexion with long dark hair down to the middle of her back you know who that is i asked pointing to her draco blaise and pansy shook their heads hope she nice pansy commented the first years then trudged in each wearing varying looks of fear on their faces some closer to hysteria there no way we were that short when we were first years blaise shook his head the sorting hat opened it brim and started to sing okay like in my other story i am so horrible at making up songs that i would scare every reader that i have off so let just pretend that there was a completely original and awesome song here okie dokie applause rose for the tattered hat and mcgonagall started calling names from a long list of names i started tuning her out clapping only when i heard my house name finally blaise younger sister isabelle became a slytherin with much clapping from my table she walked gracefully over and sat with the other first years well here we are for another year i hope you ve all had wonderful summers as you know there is quite a lot to talk about but let us wait until after we have been fed as i sure many of you are quite hungry dumbledore sat down as quickly as he had stood up and plates filled with all the food that i had missed so much during the summer did you hear that the patil twins were almost not allowed to come back this year pansy asked i rolled my eyes no i didn t but parvati is so annoying always giggling about the dumbest things draco grinned hey look weasel giving granger puppy dog eyes we followed his gaze and sure enough weasley was making eyes at an unsupecting granger i laughed how great is that he d better put those eyes back in his sockets or else they might be stuck that way blaise chuckled well one of two things can happen granger and weasel get together shutting potter out or granger rejects weasel causing a rift in the group either way the golden trio wontlast long this boys may just make my year i said shaking my head a grin still on my face we then found out the name of our new teacher professor tabulsa which is a pretty odd name if you ask me anyway she seemed nice and at least she didntmake a speech like umbridge after going through all the usual rules and adding that filch banned all www products we were sent to bed as pansy draco blaise and i flanked by crabbe and goyle made our way down to the common room i yawned man am i tired i really hope we have a free period first thing tomorrow i said stumbling into the common room draco laughed and put his hands on my shoulders preventing me from tripping in your dreams lexi you sure will be i teased grinning at him he grinned back i could make those dreams a reality i gasped and smacked him draco malfoy that is so wrong i giggled he laughed see ya tomorrow lexi you too pansy night draco blaise i replied pansy nodded night girlies blaise called from halfway up the stairs we walked into our dorm i quickly changed into some pajamas and hopped into bed so pansy what do you think this year will bring us i asked well knowing draco and blaise adn the fact that weasley has a crush on granger i d be betting on some funny as hell times pansy said turning out the light i d be betting you re right oh guys i know it bad sorry i just really want to get as many chapters out as possible before summer ends since during the school year i may not be able to write as much review please note so a lot of people pointed out my mistake in this chapter where i used draco name instead of george s thank you i edited it and it all fixed some lexi george in this you ll all be pleased to note and the return of a certain someone that i love writing thanks to everyone who reviewed chapter 29 learning to manage dear adrian i not quite sure if you ve heard yet or not but draco been attacked someone found out somehow about what he was planning to do i dontknow how much they know considering they didntknow that i knew so they probably dontknow you re involved but you might want to be on the lookout for anything suspicious i holding up okay it hard here without him the slytherin house as a whole doesntreally know what to do without their leader blaise is worried about me but i guess he should be i haventreally been feeling like myself lately i just wanted to update you i guess and obviously draco wontbe needing the portkey anymore but i d like to keep the necklace he gave it to me before they got him and it just well if it a problem i ll pay you back for it promise lexi i sighed as i continued walking down the hall toward defense blaise and pansy walked on either side of me crabbe and goyle not far behind so lexi i was thinking we could go down to the lake after lunch since we ve got a free period before you have herbology blaise said from my left i nodded and gave him a small smile cho too i asked i hadnttalked to cho as much as i should ve been in the past couple weeks yeah if you want blaise glanced at me warily and i felt a flash of guilt he d been hovering over me so much lately that i hadntrealized how much time he must be spending away from his girlfriend to spend with me of course i miss her i said as we sat down in the classroom the stares and whispers we received from our classmates didntgo unnoticed i frowned it had been about two weeks since draco had been attacked and i still hadntgotten used to the whispers and rumors from the rest of hogwarts it seemed they were almost enjoying the misery of those of us who were actually close to draco i didntmind so much when i heard the whispers about myself but i couldntbear to hear the ones about draco they didntknow draco i would think angrily to myself he tried really to be good and if it were anyone else they d be mourning till their faces turned blue with grief they said things like draco was a death eater and that he was just like his father i even heard someone say that it was a good thing someone stopped him before he killed anyone blaise had to hold me back after that one i guess that what bothered me the most about the harsh words my classmates used they were completely unfounded but they didntknow that i guess i just wished they could know like i did that draco was attacked because he was trying to get away from becoming that maybe then they d shut their mouths i thought back to my outburst in dumbledore office the more i thought about it the happier i was with what i said they deserved to know the truth about draco and to know how wrong they were to ever judge him and i d be lying if i said it didntfeel damn good to knock dumbledore off his high horse lexi blaise nudged me pay attention i smiled gratefully at him and focused on the lesson i dipped my feet in the lake as i listened to cho and blaise chat cho was catching us up on the hogwarts gossip as we d been pretty preoccupied lately she didntrelate much though so i can only assume that most of the gossip was about us or pertaining to draco but anyway so apparently weasley is very jealous of this gryffindor 7th year cormac something or other cho was explaining to us apparently he asked granger to hogsmeade blaise laughed that got to have him upset cho grinned and turned to me that not even the best part cho lowered her head and whispered to us apparently lexi you were spot on about granger becuase cormac an aspiring quidditch player i laughed hard the look of relief that passed between cho and blaise didntgo unseen by me but i decided at this moment i didntcare that they were overly concerned about me being happy i didntwant to dwell on feeling happy because i was scared the feeling would go away guys you don t think it would hurt if i just skipped out on herbology today do you i asked hopefully i mean it so nice out and well herbology boring as all hell blaise grinned i dontthink they ll miss you too much i however cantskip out on ancient runes i ve already done it 3 times this term and one more earns me a detention he stood up after giving cho a quick kiss so i ll see you girls later i smiled as i watched cho stare at blaise as he walked away you guys are cute she blushed thanks i looked over at her hesitantly i sorry if i ve been keeping him to myself you know lately i didntrealize it until just now cho looked at me eyes wide donteven think that i would be mad lexi she paused i have a good idea of how you feel i nodded cedric cho i started does it ever get any better i bit my lower lip as i waited for her to answer no she said decidedly it complicated you never really forget you know and it not like the hurt goes away at all because it doesn t it doesntstop hurting after a while though you learn to live with it and you learn that it okay for you to go on and move on with your life you know she smiled sadly i guess it doesntget better but it does get easier to bear i nodded it just i never realized how dependent i was on him how much my day revolved around his or maybe it was his day that revolved around mine i not sure it kind of pathetic really i feel like i not myself without him there he not d d dead i spit the word out and i know i shouldntbe acting like he is but it like when he isnthere i cantfunction like i normally do he was just always there you know i sighed lexi just becuase he isntdead is no reason to tell yourself you shouldntbe upset he was attacked and well tortured cho seemed to be having as much trouble talking about this as i was those sick bastards that did this to him deserve to be locked up and you have every right to be worried and upset you guys were practically inseparable draco would ve done anything for you i wanted to tell her that he did do everything for me he could ve run but instead he took the time to make sure i was safe but i didn t i hadnttold anyone what really happened i couldnttalk about it without wanting to thanks cho i smiled at her i really appreciate that you re willingly to talk about it with me it doesntmake it so hard you know cho smiled back anytime lexi i remember how alone i felt after cedric you know and i dontwant you to ever feel like that do you think i trailed off do you think he ll be okay i mean do you think he ll wake up i almost didntwant to hear her answer i had to believe he d wake up cho thought for a minute lexi if i know anything about draco it that he hates to be outdone and i pretty sure that if harry potter can cheat death what 4 times then draco sure wontlet a coma beat him he d never want to be outdone by a gryffindor this brought a smile to my face besides cho added as the bell rang signaling the end of classes draco would never leave you behind i crept out of my dorm later that night it was around 11 and surprisingly the common room was almost empty i looked around a minute before heading towards the boys dorms i pushed the open the door leading tot he 6th year dorms and allowed my eyes to adjust to the darkness i knew none of the guys would mind that over the past couple weeks they had come to expect me i slipped into draco bed and let out a sigh i really needed to stop doing this i felt blaise turn over on the bed next to me and felt his hand reach out and ruffle my hair night lex he mumbled half asleep i nestled myself deeper into draco blankets fingering momentarily the chain that still hung around my neck night blaise lexi i cantbelieve it i so sorry love i know how much draco means to you you re a strong little girl and i know you ll pull through this dontworry about the necklace keep it dontpush your friends away now lexi remember that and if you ever need a place to go donthesitate to come over here i promise you ll always have a room here if you need it more than anything though be careful it good that no one suspects you but let keep it that way try not to worry too much draco will be fine he wontlet something like this keep him down especially when he thinks he got to take care of you write me if you need anything pet adrian i sighed everyone kept telling me draco would be okay and in my heart i really believed it i couldntcomprehend a world where draco wasntaround i couldnthelp but worry though and i couldnthelp but think that maybe just maybe this whole mess was partially my fault snape was angry with me i knew from the moment i stepped into his classroom and to be honest i had expected it what i did not expect however was for it to have stayed like this for so long and i was tired of it so i decided when he snapped i was going to snap back take a page out of potter book miss conrad snape said quietly to me i shook my head quickly to clear my thoughts i would suggest that you not take a leaf out of potter book and focus more on your potion that about to boil over i gaped at him until i realized that he must ve been using legilimency on me which pissed me off professor snape i said with venom in my tone i suggest you keep your curiosity to yourself and focus more on teaching rather than perusing my thoughts snape raised an eyebrow stay after class conrad cantwait i muttered as he walked away flew more like i still maintained that snape flew around like a bat i shook my head again unsure of whether or not my potions professor was planning to make invading my privacy a habit after class i walked grudgingly up to snape desk i didntwant to apologize but he was a professor and i shouldnthave snapped back at him professor i sorry for talking back to you i said as he looked up he nodded i realize this is a hard time for you miss conrad but you cannot act as though you re the only one who is affected draco was my student as well and an exceptional one at that he paused although many at this school arentexactly sorry to have him away from here you cannot assume that everyone has those same feelings many of us miss him as well i stood there a minute unsure of what to say was i really being selfish thank you professor it just i hate hearing what people say and knowing that they re wrong but nothing i can say can make them think any differently i said carefully snape nodded it is unfortunate that the reputation of the slytherin house as well as it inhabitants has been tarnished by the few bad eggs that have passed through dontthey realize they re actually pushing us further away i asked sitting down at the nearest desk i believe they think that we are already the monsters they brand us as snape replied i shook my head then why bother trying i muttered snape looked down before sighing it is exceptionally hard to do the right thing miss conrad especially when no one is willing to acknowledge it he admitted it is up to you to find the one thing that to you is worth doing the right thing even if people refuse to see your effort i looked up at him i not sure if i really have much worth fighting for professor i said quietly snape sighed there is always something worth fighting for miss conrad he said simply i bit my lip before asking professor everything you ve heard me say you re not going to mention to anyone are you snape looked back down at his desk miss conrad as a teacher i am bound to strict confidentiality between my students and myself unless it endangers that student or others he paused whether you believe it or not i do take my duties as a teacher very seriously his eyes met mine for a moment before he looked back down at his papers signaling the end of our talk i stood and quietly let myself out of the room i walked slowly down the hall towards the common room blaise motioned for me to sit by him as i entered what did snape want he asked copying a line from his book to his parchment as he did so nothing really check up on how i was doing you know i said leaning back on the couch you should go out tonight i said suddenly what blaise asked why am i crowding you do you want me to leave you alone he asked warily no no really i said smiling i just feel bad that you re cooped up in here you ve got a girlfriend blaise you shouldnthave to baby sit me all the time you deserve some time to yourself too i nudged him dontfeel like just because i ve been a wet blanket lately you have to be one too blaise looked unsure you re positive it okay i nodded please blaise i think we both need time to ourselves blaise nodded and stood i ll be back later then i smiled at him as he left i glanced around the common room before retreating to my dorm i looked through my trunk before pulling out a trashy romance novel grinning i returned to the common room and immersed myself in the book draco hated my romance novels the next day at breakfast an owl settled itself in front of me curious i quickly relieved it of its letter i quickly scanned its contents miss conrad due to the unfortunate circumstances that have left mister draco malfoy incapacitated we at gringotts must see that his possessions are attended to mister malfoy made an individual bank account separate from his parents a few short months ago as he made this account he made it very clear that if anything were to happen to him you were to be informed of this vault and it was to be made accessible to you due to his current condition until mister malfoy is once again able to be in control of his own affairs management of his bank account will fall to you if you have any questions do not hesitate to contact us i drew in a shaky breath and stood up lex blaise asked looking as though he were going to stand with me i shook my head quickly no i exclaimed then calmed myself it fine really i just not hungry keep eating i turned and walked swiftly out of the hall i sat on the stairs in the entrance hall and breathed deeply if anything were to happen to him i read it over and over draco had never once discussed with me what could happen to him i guess i had always known the possibilities but i had thought that since draco never appeared worried about it that he had everything under control it appears now that he did worry about it i clenched the letter in my fist why hadnthe talked to me about it all those months of planning and he couldntthink to talk to me to tell me he was worried isntthat what best friends were supposed to do i blinked rapidly and sighed i wouldntcry i hadntcried at all since this happened i couldn t if i cried it made it all real lexi a voice sounded from above me i looked up and sighed hi george i said quietly he sat down next to me and rubbed the back of his head how re you doing he sounded uncertain brilliant i said sarcastically i frowned sorry no it okay it was a dumb question he laughed nervously he motioned to the letter in my hand is that what just gotten you so upset i nodded and handed him the letter i wasntquite sure why i was letting george read it maybe i needed reassurance that everything wasntmy fault george read the letter quickly and sighed he really did plan for everything then he said softly i put my head in my hands he never told me he never once said anything he told me everything was going to be okay george remained silent he my best friend he should ve told me he was worried he should ve said something i continued he probably didntwant to worry you george said i his best friend george who else is going to worry over him i snatched the letter back out of his hand i just feel george waited for me to finish abandoned i said sadly and that the worst thing i feel almost mad at him what kind of person gets angry at their best friend for going into a coma i looked up at him he reached out and put an arm around me i really cantpretend to know what you re going through george said but i do know that draco wouldntabandon you even when we were dating he didn t right and he wasntexactly my biggest fan i know he would never really leave me i said but i just i feel so angry with everyone you should he said suddenly you shouldnthave had to help draco alone and a lot of people feel angry at someone they care about when they leave even if they canthelp leaving it so unfair i muttered i sorry he said putting a hand under my chin and lifting my face up to meet his gaze i sorry for not listening to you when you tried to talk to me about it and i sorry you had to deal with helping him alone and i sorry i didntdefend you in dumbledore office because you were right i know i would never have trusted draco and i sorry for that too my eyes stung and i lowered my head george i choked please i cantdo this here nodding george helped me to my feet and led me to an empty classroom he locked the door as we went in i faced george who was standing there awkwardly i was trying to hold back the tears that were threatening to fall and my vision was becoming blurry lexi george started i dontknow if i can handle it as best i should but you can cry if you need to he said shuffling his feet that was all the invitation i needed i flung myself at him and felt his arms wrap around me as i cried i hate him i sobbed i hate him for leaving me alone george stroked my hair and tried to calm me down he going to be fine lexi it okay i miss him so much i cried but i hate the fact that i miss him it ll get easier i promise i hate that no one cares about what happened to him when cedric died everyone cared i spat you care and that probably all that matters to him i hate the fact that it my fault i said quietly sniffing as i looked up at george he pulled my closer and whispered in my ear lexi mostly everything you ve said i agree with except that i wonthave you blaming yourself you did everything you could much more than anyone ever expected of you it wasntenough i cried you couldnthave done anything more he said george i closed my eyes i watched them do it i stood there and watched them and didnteven try and stop it you were locked in a closet but i could ve done something there must ve been something i could have done i insisted lexi listen to me there is nothing that you could ve done to change what happened if you had tried anything they would ve hurt you too and then anything draco did to protect you would ve been in vain george reasoned it just hurts so much i just tired of being angry and guilty i sighed and leaned my head against his shoulder you donthave anything to be guilty of george told me quietly resting his chin on my head dontblame yourself for everyone else mistakes someone should ve realized what was happening someone else should ve helped i should have helped i looked up at him george no it wasntyour problem maybe not but you shouldnthave had to deal with this alone george paused lexi i dontknow what to tell you i really do think that draco will get better i tried to smile you think so he ruffled my hair lightly of course someone needs to keep you in line look at you mouthing off to dumbledore and snape skipping classes you re a regular delinquent he grinned and i laughed thank you george i said smiling up at him he looked down at me and i felt my pulse race no problem he kissed my forehead i grinned as he apologized no it okay i smiled and kissed him on the cheek just thank you he nodded dontthank me i ve messed things up with you enough it about time i do something to set it right he squeezed my hand and stepped back anytime you need me lex just come find me i smiled softly as he left the room i didntgo to classes that day i couldntreally bring myself to care but not for the reasons that i would ve used only a day ago that night blaise sat next to me finishing homework standing up he turned to me lexi you coming up to the dorm soon he asked stretching i looked at my paper a moment before looking up at him actually blaise i think i going to sleep in my dorm tonight blaise smiled at me that a good idea lex i said goodnight and went to my dorm i would miss draco but now i knew i could manage without him i gripped the chain that still hung around my neck at least until he came back hm i think this chapter was a bit choppy i know i switched from scene to scene a lot but that was only to get a feel of a lot of the different aspects of lexi and her coping methods i hope you liked it hahaha well guys review with your likes dislikes you know the drill you did amazing with reviews last chapter and i appreciated it so much thanks ah the school year is drawing to a close so i just wanted to let you all know that this particular story wontend when lexi 6th year does for good is going to be a story of the remainder of lexi time at hogwarts and then the sequel will pick up after lexi graduates thanks to everyone who reviewed chapter 30 meetings speeches kisses i sighed as i put on my robes looking around the room finals would be starting tomorrow but today i only had to get through potions and marketing before i could start studying i stood and stretched before making my way to the common room where i knew blaise and pansy were waiting for me ready to go to breakfast lexi blaise asked and i nodded they stood and we headed down to the great hall so gryffindor won the house cup again this year i stated as we made our way to the slytherin table it was true although this year we were a mere 20 points away from them surprisingly enough ravenclaw had won the quidditch cup and i was inclined to believe it was due mostly to cho skills as captain slytherin chose to forfeit rather than replace draco after what happened to him very honorable if you ask me i sat down to eat and laughed as pansy owl splashed her cereal in her face pansy you ve got to get a new owl i said between giggles blaise nodded that one about done for blaise agreed pansy scowled my parent just wontaccept that he should be ah retired she said he a family owl so they think he should be good enough for me to use no matter how senile he gets i laughed i just get what i want when i need it i said buttering a piece of toast my parents gave me a key to their gringotts vault lucky pansy muttered under her breath blaise just smirked at me we all knew blaise had all the money he needed due to his mother habit or marrying rich husbands only to have them pass away a few years later it seemed that the only male blaise mother truly loved was him so blaisey boy pansy said as i watched blaise cringe at the nickname how are things with you and cho blaise smirked as good as they can be you know i could tell blaise was really happy though even though he tried to appear nonchalant i smiled she really excited to be graduating i glad she won the cup this year it a good way for her to remember her last year blaise nodded she was ecstatic maybe next year we can win it i said conversationally only if draco back blaise said quietly i nodded who would they get to replace him though if he wasntby then i asked pansy snorted draco the most talent on the whole team if he isntcaptain we re doomed no matter what the other boys rely on brute force draco the only one who makes them use strategy i smiled he always works so hard on his plays it was getting easier for us to talk about draco let go find cho blaise i said suddenly blaise nodded and we left pansy to finish her breakfast it getting easier blaise said softly as we walked out of the great hall i nodded yeah i paused i just anxious for him to get better he ll be right pissed at us for forfeiting our chance at the cup blaise said laughing but you know he ll be secretly flattered that the team didntwant to go for it without him i added grinning he ll be even more conceited than normal what were we thinking blaise said in mock horror as i laughed at least we ll be around to deflate his head a bit i said as we approached cho yes there were a lot of things to look forward to when draco got back blaise and i ran down the hall gathering amused looks from the few people left in the hallway blaise we are i lost my breath going to be late we were currently running towards marketing class having lost track of the time while we were in the library jinxing he hufflepuff shoelaces to tie themselves together i consider it blaise fault i screeched to a halt in front of the classroom and swung myself inside blaise following after me little did i know granger had entered the room sometimes before us and hadntmoved out of the doorway dammit i swore as i crashed into her blaise followed suit and we were soon a heap on the floor owww i moaned i moved my arm from under blaise torso as i felt granger shift underneath me sorry lexi blaise got to his feet and held out his hand for me i grabbed it quickly and stood up we both turned to granger blaise averting his eyes and me blushing well i started but granger cut me off watch where you re going to next time conrad she said but her voice was different than it normally was when she snapped at me it actually sounded amused i narrowed my yes in suspicion before retorting well you know what they say granger you make a better door than a i trailed off a doorway i finished weakly my face heating up blaise snorted from behind me and i snapped at him dontlaugh blaise it makes perfect sense you can run right through a doorway but you cantrun through a door you know the first sign that your joke is rubbish is if you have to explain it george teased from the front of the room i felt my face flush again i held my head high and walked to my seat well i ve just suffered severe head trauma i cantbe held accountable and you know i normally very witty i turned quickly to see blaise smirking and you better wipe that smirk right off your face zabini i fought against the smile that was creeping onto my lips the lesson continued in a comfortable fashion with the twins reviewing what would be on the final they then handed back the grades for the presentations we did our presentation had actually been thrown together at the last minute as we had initially planned on draco and cho presenting the broomsticks we had to make some changes blaise took it upon himself to take draco place as he felt i had enough on my mind without learning senseless broomstick jargon we got a fairly good grade on our presentation considering when one of the twins complimented us on it i shrugged it off knowing they were probably only being nice ronald weasley however made the mistake of commenting on it you know it only because they feel bad that one of their group members got his bloody mind addled his whisper carried throughout the room everyone stopped what they were doing i turned slowly towards him potter was looking down at his desk weasley neck and ears had turned a most unappealing shade of red he obviously hadntmeant for anyone to hear his comment granger looked stricken at her friend tactless remark blaise was gripping the side of his desk so hard that his knuckles turned white cho eyes were darting back and forth between blaise and i i opened my mouth to say something but was surprised when i was cut off ronald that was out of line fred said angrily stay after class i looked up in shock to see the twins shooting him identical glares my eyes found blaise to see that he looked equally bewildered for a moment before shaking his head and smirking at weasley i glanced gratefully back up at fred and he nodded slightly in my direction the rest of the period was tense and uncomfortable and cho tried her hardest to make small talk with blaise and i i looked over at weasley to find him sulking as potter and granger were trying to do what cho was doing to us i scowled hoping fred and george would jinx their brother to hell and back for his thoughtless comment if they didn t i would it became well known throughout the school that fred and george weasley had punished their brother ron for bad talking draco malfoy torture and subsequent coma in class weasley had detention all through finals week and rumors said that one of the twins reasons that he wouldntbe studying then anyway the slytherin common room was in an uproar everyone was of course enraged at weasley comments from there emotions were mixed the slytherin house had been waiting 6 years for a teacher to tell off one of the golden trio for bad mouthing one of our house members on the one hand we were very pleased that weasley got in trouble on the other hand most didntknow how to react to the fact that draco had been defended by a weasley and a former gryffindor it was passed around the table at dinner that we would all be meeting in the common room directly after eating a slytherin house meeting as it were it was a habit that if at any time something happened that affected the whole house a meeting was called i d only seen it happen once before in my second year it was called then to find out who if any of us had opened the chamber of secrets obviously it wasnta slytherin well not really blaise pansy and i ate quickly then headed to the common room we got a few suspicious glances from the other houses since a lot of other slytherins were walking with us but we chose to ignore them the common room was crowded when we got there but since we were older than most of the other students we took a seat in the center of the room along with the 7th years all right settle down you guys jordan vaisey said vaisey was a scrawny slytherin 7th year who had a habit of bossing everyone around so we all know what happened today right vaisey looked around we know that in their marketing class today that lousy little weasel made a rather rude comment about our fellow house mate draco and his vaisey paused unfortunate situation he said delicately there was a general outcry of anger as he finished speaking and blaise spoke up i was there so i also know that he got yelled at for it and from what we ve heard got a weeks detention murmurs of agreement followed this but you must remember celeste wilkes began that it was the weasley twins that punished him how are we supposed to be grateful towards a bunch of blood traitor mudblood lovers like them the room then broke out in whispers and conversations i looked around it seemed that the only older house members actually interested in participating were myself blaise pansy vaisey celeste and dominic urquhart i glanced over at the last two who huddled on the couch celeste wilkes came from a family of well know voldemort supporters and was proud to tell anyone she felt the same way in essence she was everything i pretended to be around my family she was the most cold hearted person i d ever met and i doubted that her interest in draco affairs were out concern so much as an impulse to maintain pride within her house dominic urquhart was the top of his class and probably would ve been head boy if he hadntsuch a long record of misuse of magic in the corridors dominic was calculating and so cynical at times that it made me sick together they made up the golden couple of slytherin there was no doubt in my mind that they would get married and considering both of their personalities they definitely deserved each other they might even be happy together or at least pretend to be so this is the question how do we respond to this vaisey asked in an irritated tone i could tell he was already getting tired of the disorder in the common room i myself was about to suggest sending the youngest kids away and leaving the older students to decide what was to be done i dontthink we should do anything celeste said decidedly if they want to defend draco fine but they shouldntexpect anything from us more whispers blaise glanced at me what do you think lexi he asked urquhart nodded you are his best friend what would he think of this whole thing i sighed i just i dontthink we owe them anything for defending draco but i cantsee how it would hurt to just lay off them a little i shrugged vaisey spoke up they re gryffindor lexi he exclaimed they re teachers vaisey pansy snapped back i agree with lexi we sit here and complain all the time about teachers not giving us a fair chance and then when some finally do we re about to blow them off just because they used to be in gryffindor i nodded exactly i not saying we should be nice to them obviously but i just saying maybe if we ignored them for a while instead of insulting them that they d be inclined to defend us a bit more i said are you saying we need that riffraff defending us celeste spoke up again i shook my head no but what could it hurt if they re willing to go against their own brother for us we might as well take advantage of it i grinned take advantage of it now celeste was interested how do you suppose we do that anything that involved manipulation or coercion was okay in a slytherin eyes well i think turning the other cheek when the twins walk down the hall instead of fighting with them like we always do is a small price to pay if they re going to hand out detentions to anyone who talks about draco right now i paused it ll set a standard you know teach the other houses that they cantalways gang up on us and get away with it at least not in the classroom anymore vaisey nodded that true and since the twins started punishing people the other teachers will feel like they have to this really could work in our favor a ripple of excitement ran through the common room so what are you suggesting we do damian spoke up from one of the armchairs get all chummy with the rodent twins blaise shook his head not chummy exactly more like we should start treating them like teachers you know we can make fun of them still just not to their face dontgive them a reason to start favoring gryffindor again right vaisey nodded i like the idea so it settled lay off the twins at least for as long as they re on our side about this wait just a minute someone spoke up what about the other weasley ron vaisey turned towards me well i smirked he fair game laughter could be heard throughout the room all right so everything settled now right vaisey looked around and then nodded good now everyone go on i cantstand to see the common room this crowded blaise and i grinned at each other before leaving the common room finals week was grueling it seemed like even though we didnthave a major exam for the end of 6th year our teachers were determined to make us suffer as much as possible was it just me or were there spells on that exam that we hadnteven heard of much less covered in class i asked blaise as we exited our charms exam if we did it was on one of the days i skived off blaise replied we walked towards the entrance hall planning on going outside and relaxing the rest of the day when the twins rushed by george grinned at me as he rushed by and fred shot me a small smile i nodded at them hmmm blaise smirked knowingly what i asked he continued smirking nothing he raised his eyebrows seriously blaise what i smacked his arm dontsmirk at me you just seem to be getting pretty cozy with weasley again i doubt he or his twin would ve said anything to his little brother had draco not been your friend blaise paused not that i complaining or anything i just want you to know what you re getting yourself into i am not getting myself into anything trust me i said firmly blaise was still smirking as we walked across the grounds and stop it with that smirk now i looked at my trunk overflowing with clothing and books trying to figure out how to close it this may be problematic usually draco would come close my trunk for me and it wouldntbe very hard for him i closed the lid as much as i could before sitting on it i then shifted so i could reach down and lock the trunk i snapped the latch on the trunk and grinned in triumph take that i said happily i glanced around my empty dorm room the other girls in my dorm always waited until after the end of the year feast to pack i liked to get it done before i glanced at my watch the feast was going to be starting any minute i decided to head up to the great hall on my own since i knew blaise had taken cho on a date and would be coming to the feast on his own the hall was filled with people when i went in so i quickly made my way over to the slytherin table to claim seats for blaise and myself i ended up sitting next to celeste i wasntsure whether that was unfortunate or not so lexi dear celeste drawled how have you been holding up i resisted the urge to roll my eyes i fine celeste thanks for asking i feel just horrible about draco she continued and this time i really did roll my eyes she didntnotice and i cantimagine how you must be feeling since he was your best friend after all yeah i said shortly it was definitely unfortunate that i had sat next to celeste i mean if something like that happened to dominic i d go absolutely crazy she paused and i wouldntstop till i got back at whoever would dare lay a hand on him easier said than done i thought well we dontreally know who did it i said instead oh of course it nothing official but i think we all know who did it dontyou she said slyly and who pray tell do you think it was celeste i ground out where the hell was blaise the muggleborns of course she said those filthy cretins were obviously jealous of draco talent and his heritage who else would attack a pureblood we certainly wouldntattack one of our own i had to bite down on my tongue to keep from saying something i paused and collected myself before responding one of our own i murmured we are very loyal towards our own arentwe i had to fight the urge to laugh of course celeste said sweetly not catching my sarcastic tone which is why we ll always be here to take care of you during this trying time thanks celeste i returned in a sickeningly sweet voice she smiled at me before turning back to urquhart blaise said conversationally from my other side should i remove all sharp utensils from your reach or are you going to be okay with that i jumped in my seat blaise when did you get here a little bit ago long enough to know that celeste is either very dumb or you re the world best actress blaise said and even though i could tell you were borderline homicidal doesntmean everyone can he smirked i just know you that well i rolled my eyes that entire conversation made me want to swallow bubotuber pus blaise nodded what do you think dumbledore going to say in his little speech i snorted nothing about draco that for sure probably going to give potter an award or something blaise grinned now now lex what could he give potter an award for tying his own shoes i smirked he never needed a good reason before dumbledore stood and everyone quickly silenced themselves i looked down at my plate not in the mood to listen to the gryffindor win the house cup once again and so we reach the end of another year he began very observant i said sarcastically i heard celeste giggle next to me and as such the house cup must be awarded he said in a very predictable fashion in fourth place with an even four hundred points is the hufflepuff house a polite applause rose in the hall which no one in my house participated in just cantcatch a break can they blaise tsked always coming in last in third place with four hundred and fifty seven points is the ravenclaw house dumbledore continued and may i also congratulate them on winning the quidditch house cup even the slytherins participated in the applause for ravenclaw we were glad someone had beaten potter and his band of gryffindors even if it couldntbe us in third place with five hundred and six points the slytherin house there was a fair amount of applause for us since most of the hufflepuffs were too polite to not clap and the winner of the house cup with five hundred and twenty six points is the gryffindor house lovely i said irritably blaise shifted his eyes over to me you re in a mood today he said curiously i grunted in response yes very good job gryffindor dumbledore continued wasnthe finished yet before you all enjoy this delicious feast i would like to say a few words about the trying times we are going through let me guess help out anyone that isntwearing a green and silver scarf i muttered to myself blaise didnthear me although we have been brought up in a time when it is okay to be divided that time has come to an end if we any of us really plan on surviving this war we must do it with all who wish to survive with us no matter their background or affiliations anyone who requests help must be given it it is only through being united that we can hope to diminish the great challenges that face our society dumbledore said seriously i stared up at him and for the second time i noticed how old he really looked i sighed what a load of rubbish celeste sniffed as if we needed to unite with any of these filthy muggle loving fools i finished under my breath with her i stared at the enchanted ceiling wishing i could sit and mock dumbledore as easy as celeste could if draco were here i probably could and maybe if george werentstaring at me from the teachers table lexi come on i thought you packed your trunk already blaise shouted from the common room i coming i coming i answered hurriedly we hurried out of the castle with our trunks making sure to get a carriage to ourselves is cho sitting with us i asked as we rode towards the train station nah she said something about sitting with her housemates for the last time blaise paused honestly i cantwait until i donthave to see any of our classmates anymore i shrugged we dontreally have to deal with a lot of them now as it is blaise didn t respond as we had arrived at the station come on we need to get a compartment we found a compartment easily enough and i told blaise i was going to change out of my robes and that i d be back soon i changed quickly in the bathroom and headed back to blaise wondering who else would be sitting with us lexi someone whispered i look around and saw a compartment door close what i glanced around then crept up to the compartment door i slowly opened it and then it snapped open the rest of the way to reveal two identical grinning faces lexi they exclaimed together hi i said an amused smile making its way onto my face come in love fred said while george grabbed me by the arm and pulled me inside fred shut the door uhm okay i said shaking my head how ve you been george asked his hand not leaving my arm it was very hard to concentrate while i answered him good and yourself merlin he smelled fantastic good i looked up at him and noticed a strange look in his eye and you fred i asked good good but we actually had a question for you my lovely little snake fred said slinging an arm around my shoulder and that would be i asked as he led me to a seat in the compartment each twin sitting on either side of me why oh why have you sneaky little slytherins been being so unusually tolerant of us as of late george asked it really been quite puzzling and we re not quite sure how to respond so if you could fill us in we d be most appreciative george finished it took me a minute to sort out what they said oh i exclaimed well you see we all agreed to kind of you know lay off you guys for a bit the twins nudged me to continue because you guys stood up for draco and i mean come on i paused even slytherins know how to show their appreciation the twins looked at me again their features softening of course we did lexi george said quietly you think we wouldn t fred asked we may not have gotten along with malfoy but hell lexi no one deserves that y know i know i whispered but still it means a lot so would that also explain why although we re being given a reprieve from the nasty comments of your housemates ronnie has been getting slammed fred pondered i nodded and dontyou dare say he doesntdeserve it i said stubbornly the twins glanced at each other and nodded lexi what you dontunderstand is ron is well he not the sharpest tool in the shed he doesntknow when to close his mouth and half of what he says he doesntmean george reasoned i shrugged in any case now that we ve sorted that out i going to go make sure ron doesntget ambushed on the ride home fred stood why are you guys riding the train anyway i asked they grinned well we didntget to ride the train home our 7th year did we let just say we did it for nostalgia sake fred winked at me as he left so i smiled shyly at george are you going to be teaching next year not sure he grinned why dontwant to take my class again i laughed no no i was just wondering if i d see you next year is all meaning i was hoping i d get to see him next year well george ears had a red tinge to them i was actually hoping that i d see you before the next school year starts i tried to steady my breathing oh my voice was an unnatural pitch uhm you mean it d be nice he said quickly you know if i could see you over the summer i smiled timidly it would be george face brightened so i ll see you i nodded i ll try my hardest he grinned great i just he stopped looking down at me i glanced up at him before i began talking to george i d never taken the time to realize how good looking he was he wasntthe cedric diggory in your face gorgeous but merlin he was something he wasnttan with smooth dark hair like adrian but something about his freckles made him utterly adorable his almost permanent grin made something in my stomach flutter and his eyes made my mind go absolutely blank it was while i was staring at george that i realized three very important facts one george was just as handsome as he had been while we were dating if not more so absence makes the heart grow fonder you know two even though we werenttogether anymore george was still the only boy that could make my heart race the third point was the most important and perhaps the hardest to admit i was still in love with george weasley lexi i hadntrealized how close our faces had gotten now there were only a few inches separating us george i questioned if you need anything anything at all his breath tickled my face i want you to come to me okay okay we both leaned in little by little my head smacked against the back of the seat as the train turned george and i looked at each other wide eyed uhm i should go blaise will worry i said quickly george scrambled to his feet as i headed for the door lexi i turned around and felt george arms slip around my waist pressing me against the compartment door george i i was cut off as he pressed his lips against mine it wasnta long kiss it wasnthard or passionate or anything like that it was short and sweet and his lips were so gently pressed against mine that i very well could have been imagining it but i wasn t and it was one of the best kisses of my life just remember he said leaning his forehead against mine okay okay i replied just as softly he smiled softly at me and pushed a piece of hair out of my face i closed my eyes as his hand ran along my face see you later lexi he said and exited the compartment i sighed and leaned against the wall another point had been proven during my time spent with george he was still a fabulous kisser yaaaay i d almost forgotten how much i loved writing george lexi silly me anyway review next chapter is lexi vs her family and where oh where do you think she goes for comfort family drama time oh and just to verify this is most certainly au i know someone asked and and and if everyone could be so kind as to check out a one shot i posted a few weeks ago called mission accomplished that would be really great thanks to everyone who reviewed xxxsour lemonxxx wolf xavia jackie pappillion nineintheafternoon4 mentally disrupted toboeshi ryanenight92 crea kristen lilyjet last blue mage insert something witty lucyblue mg 2 die is 2 live silent me madeline cullen gaara cherry silence is silver hazeleyedhottie chapter 31 family matters vaults it came as a surprise to me that my mother and father werentthe only people waiting for me at the train station although it shouldnthave been much of a surprise the malfoys were there too i fought to keep the disgust that i felt at the sight of lucius and my father out of my expression as i approached them blaise following close behind me mother father i greeted giving my mother a small cold hug and nodded to my father i turned to the malfoys and was surprised when draco mother threw her arms around me alexis she said her voice laced with sorrow i mrs malfoy i said gently i know her grip tightened you miss him too she asked i looked at her and noticed the wrinkles that hadntbeen there before and how she seemed to be much thinner than the last time i d seen her i wondered if she knew who was responsible for draco attack i wasntsure how she could have it didntseem likely everyday i responded is there any change in his condition lucius answered this time i afraid not it very hard for us to even see him dumbledore insisted that since it happened while draco was at school even though he wasnt in school that no one be let in without his permission he spat keeping us away from our own son i wanted to say that not letting lucius see his son was probably the smartest thing dumbledore had ever done but i kept my mouth shut oh alexis we were so worried my mother cooed and blaise thank you so much i sure you ve been looking after her blaise grinned and nodded i always do mrs conrad my mother smiled at his manners i gave blaise a tight hug you re writing me this summer and we re visiting each other understand i muttered in his ear of course lexi he squeezed me just owl me blaise said goodbye to us and went to meet his mother come on alexis we re taking a portkey home my father said levitating my trunk towards the station exit i found myself sandwiched between narcissa and my mother it a horrible society we live in when a pureblood canteven roam a magical community by himself without fear of being attacked my mother said as we walked along it a horrible society we live in when fathers attack their own sons i thought i glanced around the station as we walked and immediately spotted a group of red heads obviously the weasleys i suppressed a sigh i doubted that i d be able to leave my parents sight at all this summer let alone long enough to see george come alexis you ll miss the portkey my mother said as she yanked my hand towards the silver goblet lucius was clutching i felt the familiar tug of a portkey and before i knew it i was home i couldnthelp but think that draco would be in france by now if everything had gone according to plan i was correct in thinking that my parents would be stricter that summer than they usually were i wasntsure if it was because of draco attack that they were worried about me my mother at least since i knew that my father knew damned well what really happened to draco or if because of draco betrayal they were worried about my own loyalties and wanted to keep me away from any unsavory influences i sighed as i listened to my parents talk about the ministry it had only been one week into summer vacation and i was already bored out of my mind draco would usually be with me everyday but now the only person my parents really permitted me to see was blaise speaking of alexis my mother looked towards me i glanced up at her from the book i had been staring at is blaise zabini still dating that cho chang yes mother i said going back to my book i couldntdiscern what the noise my mother made meant until she continued very good blood the changs but wasntshe involved with that silly diggory boy i tensed she was my mother laughed coldly oh yes she was she said airily i clenched the book i was holding she nice i said boldly i could feel my mother harsh gaze on me but refused to look up as long as blaise keeps her in line my mother finally compromised it would be unfortunate really if he couldn t the image of an unconscious draco lying on the ground flashed through my mind i kept my eyes trained onto my book unfortunate i repeated and as my mother returned to speaking with my father i knew the conversation had ended i stared into space a bit longer before retreating to my room my room wasntcluttered like george or heavily decorated like draco s it was actually pretty bare but i liked it that way t was organized and clean and because of that it probably wasntevident that someone actually lived there i perched on the edge of my bed as i thought of the conversation that had just taken place i frowned and reached over to the nightstand next to my bed grabbing some parchment and a quill blaise i so bored can you believe it a week into summer and i ve already run out of things to do my parents are being ridiculously strict and say you re the only person i allowed to see it a sad world we live in when blaise zabini is trusted with a prominent family only daughter over anyone else no matter though i know you re going to greece sometime in july so you d better fill your schedule with lexi conrad before that and cho too of course lexi i grinned and sent the letter off i hoped blaise would get the letter within the day and be over tomorrow i sighed and curled up on my bed intent on finishing my book i woke up a few hours later to my stomach growling i groaned and rose from my bed stretching before i went in search of something to eat i walked slowly down the hall wondering what food the house elves had prepared when i heard hushed whispers coming from the library getting more and more anxious my mother said what do you mean my father voice was indifferent what i mean is what i said my mother snapped lucius is getting far too anxious over his son betrayal and i getting worried worried about what my father asked worried that his anxiety will soon cause problems he bordering on paranoia wondering if anyone else knows about draco it took everything in me to convince him that alexis didnt no wouldnt have anything to do with such an idea lucius is just in shock my father said calmly no one expected this of draco he was always a model pureblood lucius paranoia will get us all in trouble if he doesntcheck himself my mother replied if he keeps scurrying around looking for draco assistant even thought there werentany he will only stir up trouble and suspicion on the part of the dark lord everything was silent for a moment and my mother continued and i wonthave his insane notions getting us into trouble she said with finality i scurried away from the door towards the kitchen as i thought about what i had just heard i wasntsurprised that lucius suspected me it seemed logical that i would have something to do with it what surprised and worried me was how unhinged he had apparently become apparently he wasntas indifferent to draco attempted escape as he pretended to be i sat at the kitchen counter as i waited for our house elf to bring me some cheesecake i concluded that there wasntmuch i could do about lucius and his paranoia i would just have to be more careful that all i clutched the chain around my neck lightly it was all very unnerving cho thanks for the letter i am very bored my parents have been filling up my time with boring visits to the malfoys it isntthe same without having draco there for me to visit with they try and involve me in their conversations but i not interested in anything they have to say please keep writing to me and hopefully i ll be able to tear myself away from them soon enough to come visit you lexi i sighed and pulled on a set of robes before going to meet my parents downstairs today we were visiting the parkinsons which in any case i was glad to be around someone my age alexis my mother called hurry i coming mother i replied i grabbed a pinch of floo powder and the next thing i knew i was stepping into the parkinsons sitting room lexi pansy smiled at me her parents standing next to her i greeted them politely as my parents arrived pansy and i quickly escaped to the third floor of her house where her room was how ve you been pansy i asked as i sat down on in a chair by her window oh you know i ve been spending a lot of time at home it strange none of our parents seem to want to let us out of their sight pansy stopped well i guess not that strange i snorted it annoying that all pansy looked at me surprised lexi they re just trying to make sure we re safe she exclaimed i am perfectly sure we re safe we re all capable witches and wizards i said glancing out the window it was a sunny day and i could see pansy neighbors outside having lunch on their patio draco is a capable wizard lexi pansy said quietly that my fault i said quietly pansy walked over to me and sat down in a chair next to me lexi really dontblame yourself she said quietly we all know you think it your fault that you werentthere to help draco but it isn t i sighed supposing that it was a good thing pansy misunderstood me the only people to blame are the sick freaks who did this to him in the first place you couldnthave known if only she knew i managed a smile i know pansy thanks you re right pansy smiled back maybe our parents will let us go out together see suggested it wouldntbe too bad if we promised to go to diagon alley only we can at least try i admitted our parents were reluctant to let us go but after some persuasion we were allowed to go to diagon alley until dinnertime merlin pansy it been forever since i ve been somewhere without my parents they re sticking to me like glue i exclaimed pansy nodded let just enjoy our few hours of freedom we headed off to madame malkin s as pansy said she needed some new robes i didntmind waiting as i could look through some wizarding magazines in the shop i glanced out the window and saw a flash of blonde hair i squinted and tried to see more clearly once i realized what i was seeing i quickly ducked my head down and absorbed myself in the magazine i was reading lucius malfoy was in diagon alley i tried shrugging it off but i couldntget my mother words to my father out of my head sorry it took so long lexi pansy exclaimed as she hurried over to me packages in hand it fine i said distractedly let get some ice cream shall we i mean it wontruin our appetites pansy suggested i glanced at her ruin our appetites i smirked well i mean my parents dontlike it when i donteat a healthy dinner pansy defended herself i laughed it okay pansy let go get that ice cream i paused but maybe you should get a kid sundae so you dontruin your appetite i teased pansy laughed sure we sat at a table outside of the ice cream shop and ordered oh look it draco father pansy said i whipped my head around and sure enough lucius was lurking about i narrowed my eyes and turned away dontcall him over here i said lightly and continued eating pansy looked puzzled why not she asked and i shrugged pansy hadntseen lucius outside of madame malkin like i had or perhaps she d be getting the creepy vibe i was dontknow it just we wanted to get away from the parents right i made an excuse and shook my head now i was the one being paranoid i quickly finished my ice cream as pansy continued to tell me about her summer and so my parents decided that we re going to go to hawaii for a couple of weeks pansy chattered on her ice cream long forgotten about i think it would be a good time for me to meet a new boy you know a nice wizard someone that could make me forget about my vendetta against draco she stopped and frowned i really feel bad about that now i shrugged it okay pansy i mean draco didntexactly treat you as he should have you know she nodded still she trailed off i looked down at her melted ice cream and then checked the time we should probably be leaving if we want to stop anywhere else before we have to be home i commented pansy nodded and we left trying to find somewhere to go we were walking towards flourish and blotts when i stopped pansy turned lexi what weasley wizard wheezes i bit my lower lip and glanced at pansy she sighed i dontunderstand why you d want to go in there she sighed but make it quick i grinned at her sure you dontwant to come in she shook her head are you kidding me those goody goodies will probably put a stake through my heart i nodded i ll be five minutes at the most i hurried into the store the shop was bustling with customers so much so that i had to squeeze past a crowd of people to even get inside lexi someone nearby said to me i turned to see george grinning down at me hi i smiled you made it out here i was worried you wouldntbe allowed he put a hand on the small of my back and steered me through the crowd well i really not i was only stopping by for a minute i said apologetically george looked rather put out oh well i guess that s if you cantstay trust me i d love to i ve been stuck at home all summer i sighed george faked a gasp an abomination i know i replied seriously well i glad you chose to spend some of your only free time visiting little old georgie he smirked but i could see a faint blush grace his cheeks i smiled softly well of course i glanced at my watch i should be going i told pansy i d only be five minutes george tugged at a strand of my hair stay out of trouble for me i laughed you re hardly one to talk about staying out of trouble mister weasley george smiled softly at me you know i couldntstand it if anything happened to you love he said lightly before turning back to his work i stood there for a moment my mouth hanging open when it finally registered in my mind that george wasntgoing to come back and explain what he had just said i shook myself out of a trance and left the store pansy to my surprise was waiting anxiously across the street lexi we ve got to get home now she said panic evident in her features pansy what wrong i asked while you were in there lucius walked by he saw me sitting here and asked where you were i well i tried to lie and said you d just gone to the bathroom but then he glanced over to the store like he knew somehow he knew you were in there and he just smirked pansy stopped to breath and his smirk is so much scarier than draco s i froze if lucius knew or even suspected that i was in george store it wouldntbe long before my parents knew and even if he didntknow exactly why i was in there the fact that i was in the company of a weasley or in a store owned by one would be enough to infuriate my parents dammit i exclaimed let go it looked as though a confrontation with my parents was eminent i didntknow what i was going to do it was about three days before my parents brought up the day at diagon alley those three days were spent in absolute terror but they were not wasted on my part i had decided that i wouldntconfess to my parents about my relationship with george but i also would stand my ground against them we were overdue for a chat about my belief on certain subjects anyway and after what happened to draco i couldntlie to them or myself anymore and so it began alexis darling my mother said to me day at lunch my father was currently at work and wouldntbe home until later that night so it was just the two of us yes mother i replied politely i d like to see you in your father study after lunch if you dontmind there a matter of importance i d like to discuss with you she said her voice composed and her tone icy of course i nodded my heart was pounding as i stood up may i be excused if you re finished my mother said not looking up from her meal i ll have you summoned when i ready i went up to my room and paced around before getting my trunk out of my closet it couldnthurt to be prepared i threw as many clothes as i could fit into my trunk along with my schoolbooks and other various trinkets i made sure to place the portkey draco had given me safely in the trunk before i shrunk it and stuck it in my pocket my birthday wasntfor another month but i knew my magical signature couldntbe distinguished from my mother s i sat on my bed and waited until i was called down to my father study i glanced around the room quickly spying something sitting on my nightstand i grabbed it and slid it in my pocket i took a deep breath and headed downstairs i knocked on the door come in alexis i slid into the room and made my way to the sofa what did you want to see me about i asked quietly i ve had some very interesting news about you alexis my mother said softly from lucius he tells me that he saw you at diagon alley the other day really i tried to sound surprised he also tells me that he saw you in the shop owned by those horrid weasley boys she continued now i know that this isnttrue i know that my daughter would never lower herself to associate with blood traitors i was silent so you were in there i glanced up at my mother as she walked towards me why because i felt like it i said quietly she gripped my arm painfully alexis i understand you re going through a hard time with draco being attacked but think of who did it to him you re going to fraternize with the same people who advocate such behavior she asked i yanked my arm out of her grasp you dontunderstand what i going through at all i paused and quickly added you said yourself lucius was being paranoid my mother stared at me before grabbing my hair and yanking me out of my seat how much of that conversation did you hear she snapped i didnt need to hear any of it to find out that it was lucius that caused his own son to fall into a coma if that what your asking i said defiantly you knew my mother had never looked so close to shock in her life of course i knew i yelled breaking out of her grasp it sick and it twisted and i cantbelieve father would help with such an awful horrible plan how could you ever agree with it you ve known draco since he was a baby he about as much your son as i am your daught her hand connected with my face and i stumbled back my eyes wide although i knew draco was used to corporal punishment my parents had never hit me alexis victoria conrad you listen to me my mother hissed i will not be disrespected in such a manner draco was disloyal his father had no choice it was unfortunate what happened and you knowing about his disloyalty and not telling makes you just as guilty she paused and drew herself up to her full height but as you re my daughter i am willing to overlook the fact that any of this happened i honored i muttered sarcastically she ignored me perhaps it good that you know the truth this way you can see personally what happens to those who stray from the path they ve chosen draco path was chosen for him i spat she grabbed my shoulders and shoved me against the wall any daughter of mine will have unwavering loyalty to the dark lord alexis i could feel her nails digging into my skin like it or not we are your family we re all you have she sneered i stared at her as memories flooded my mind love i want you to remember anything you need anything at all you write me i always willing to help out a friend if you need anything anything at all i want you to come to me okay we always have a choice lexi dontforget that just remember okay you should ve known i answered shakily that the minute any of you laid a hand on draco you d be pushing me away as well i pulled out of her grasp once again it seems to me you re the ones with no familial loyalty she slapped me again i could feel my cheek burning but ignored it you will learn to be obedient alexis i fear i ve let you have far too much liberty if this is the way you ve turned out she paused we will certainly discuss this when your father gets home from work i glared at her back as she headed out of the room she paused someday alexis you will look back on this conversation and thank me for setting you on the right path she laughed coldly after all that what family is for right the door snapped shut behind her and i made up my mind at the same time i made sure my trunk was still in my pocket and made my way to the fireplace why my mother assumed i would stay at home i could only guess i knew she thought i had nowhere to go nowhere that she couldntreach me she was wrong i laughed at the irony of my mother statement because she was right she had set me on the right path i would never be what she was i grabbed a handful of floo powder and cast one last disgusted look about the room i was in before stepping into the fireplace diagon alley i said clearly i stepped out of the grate carefully fingering the gringotts key i had put in my pocket before i left my room first things first after all it was my money too and it not like they d notice it was gone after withdrawing enough money to get me through a few weeks if spent sparingly before i went to the one place where i knew i d be welcome well that not exactly true i had thought of going to adrian s but that was risky and easily traced i got there quickly as i d been there before i decided to knock since it wasntvery late and they shouldntbe sitting down for dinner yet i had hoped not at least i knocked on the door and waited the door opened lexi the voice sounded surprised i well my parents you know i trailed off at my statement fred nodded in understanding you re the only snake that welcome here he said smiling i appreciated his attempt thank you i said sincerely who is it fred a voice called from within the flat fred grinned mischievously at me just lexi he called back i heard a large crash and a clatter as george ran rather slid into the room i glanced down at his socks in amusement purple with dragons i raised an eyebrow he shrugged you cantdeny i can pull it off he smirked i laughed well it a good thing you werentfive minutes later or else i d have just gotten dinner for two fred said as he slipped on his jacket as you re here now how does takeout from the leaky cauldron sound i told fred it sounded fine and gave him my order they refused to let me pay for my meal so i had to settle for promising to wash the dishes we can use magic to do that too you know george said after fred left i shrugged i know but i dontwant to impose truthfully i was embarrassed i had just run away from home so i really wasntin any position to expect to be pampered er are you going to be all right george asked scratching the back of his head i had to smile at his attire his socks were complimented by pair of faded jeans an plain white t shirt and a robe thrown haphazardly on his shoulder left unbuttoned i ll be fine i said to myself as well as george did your parents ah find out that you he trailed off i told my mother i knew about draco i paused she told me i shouldnteven think of questioning my loyalty to my family are you draco was more family to me than either of my parents i told her i could never be what she wanted me to be after what happened to him i said firmly george came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me resting his chin on top of my hair i glad he said quietly dontgo thinking anything extreme george i wontbe joining the order anytime soon if that what you re thinking i may not want to be a death eater but that doesntmean i want to join your merry band of rabble rousers i warned him i didntwant him to expect anything that i wasntwilling to give and if that meant finding another place to stay so be it i understand his arms tightened around me i just glad your safe somewhere where i can keep an eye on you i leaned into his embrace and sighed i didnthave to thank him again because we both knew how grateful i was and for the first time in a while i really did feel safe wow sorry that took so long i promise i will try and have the next chapter out within two weeks please review with what you liked what you didn t any compliments or criticism is welcome thanks to everyone who reviewed chapter 32 living arrangements and cake batter george and fred let me sleep on their couch that night i woke early the next morning and made myself a cup of tea from their kitchen neither of them were up so i sat down on the couch after folding the blankets i d used the night before i sighed and glanced at the clock on the wall it was 7am i got up with a sigh and opened the trunk that had been placed in the corner of the living room i rummaged around until i found a quill ink and a bit of parchment and scribbled a note to cho cho i think it would be better if i sent this to you and i sure blaise would agree can you both meet me in the twins shop later today it extremely important lexi i glanced around before cursing under my breath i had forgotten to bring selene with me i d have to ask one of the twins for their owl i crept quietly down the hallway of their flat and knocked on a door at random psssst i whispered through the door hello i got a grumble in response hey i said a little louder i heard some shuffling in the room and the door opened i came face to chest with a shirtless weasley thank merlin i picked george door h hey hi i sputtered finally tearing my eyes away it wasntlike george was a chiseled underwear model or anything he was a little stocky but he was definitely in shape while he didnthave a six pack his abs were very well defined it was very nice to look at and his messy bed head went quite well with it lexi george blinked a few times it a little too early for you to be pining after me isntit love he teased i blushed you wish georgie i paused i uh actually need to borrow your owl i forgot to bring mine i had to write to blaise george yawned sure i ll get him for you come in i hesitated outside of the door for a moment before going in george room was dark he obviously hadntturned his light on before letting me in my eyes adjusted to the dark and i could make out the shape of his bed desk dresser and a cauldron in the corner george brought his owl over to me in the dark motioning for me to attach my letter to it leg i did so and he set it on the window sill and the owl immediately took off thanks i squinted around the dark room uh could you turn a light on i could almost see george grinning from somewhere in front of me nah he said lightly i going back to bed oh well i guess i ll just be out in the living room then i said nervously i felt my way towards the door when i ran into a very solid george he laughed lightly and i could feel his chest vibrating against me you should watch where you re going lexi it dark in here i protested my hand still on his chest i felt his hand cover mine a big bad slytherin like yourself isntafraid of the dark right his face was so close to mine that i could make out all of his features no not exactly i whispered i just dontwant to fall and look stupid george moved his head up a little and kissed my forehead gently before reaching his arm over to the wall and flipping on the light switch if you fell i d just catch you he said lightly my eyes widened as he left the room i stood there until i heard the shower running and then shook my head i hurried out into the living room and flung myself on the couch in embarrassment covering up with the blankets i had just folded i was so confused it seemed every time george did something like kissing my forehead or kissing me in the train compartment he just left like nothing out of the ordinary had happened which i hopefully wasntmistaken on this point i did not think george weasley kissed every girl that happened to be within two meters of him i sighed and burrowed into my fort of blankets thinking that maybe falling back asleep until i got a reply from cho wouldntbe such a bad idea i was slowly drifting off to sleep when i heard someone call my name it was george lexi i peered out from under the blankets and saw him standing over me an amused smile on his face so you wake me up then decide to go back to bed yourself i grinned up at him i was tired i moved my legs over so he could sit on the edge of the couch what on your agenda for the day george asked hopefully meeting with cho and blaise to let them know what going on i paused i uh really appreciate you letting me spend the night you know i should be out of your hair in no time george glanced at me for a moment before turning his attention to the window dontworry about it lexi i told you to come to me if you needed to i know i just dontthink it right for me to impose like this i sat up still wrapped in blankets george leaned against the back of the couch you know you re not imposing i d rather have you safe than anything else i smiled at him quickly still covered by the blankets thanks i paused when do you guys open up the shop george glanced at his watch not for a while about an hour i usually dontget up until 8 45 and the shop opens at 9 he grinned what are you going to do with all of this extra time i asked george shrugged probably go over the books you know get a head start there nothing else to do he stood up is there anything you need lexi i shrugged i dontthink so i have clothes to change into i ll need to do a bit of shopping today maybe get some more money out of my parents vault before they cut me off i stood up and stretched the blankets falling off of me you can grab something to eat here if you want while you wait for a response to your owl george said i nodded and he showed me to the kitchen help yourself george said sitting at the table and helping himself to some cereal i glanced around the kitchen and found a bowl pouring myself some cereal as well we ate in silence before a tapping was heard on the window george got up and let his owl in a response tied to its leg i grabbed the letter and opened it scanning it quickly we ll be there when the shop opens that was fast i said looks like i d better hurry i stood heading over to where my trunk was on the living room floor i grabbed a change of clothes and headed to the bathroom i was pulling on my robes when a knock at the door startled me lexi you still going to gringotts george asked from the other side of the door yes in a minute i want to get there before i meet with blaise and cho i ll come with you george said dontwant you to run into anyone i smiled as i opened the door i can take care of myself you know i said grinning george shrugged i dontwant my favorite girl getting into trouble he said simply then added i ll be waiting for you when you re finished getting ready i blinked a few times as he walked away george weasley always found the most endearing ways to fluster me george you cantask the goblins if they re tall enough to operate the carts i admonished as we ran out of the bank after i withdrew more money from my family vault it was a valid question george defended himself it was rude and you re lucky they didntfeed us to the dragon i said glancing behind at him unfortunately i wasntwatching where i was going and almost tripped on a crack on the sidewalk george reached out and grabbed my hand a little clumsy today perhaps he asked and i blushed not because i was clumsy but because he still hadntlet go of my hand and he didntthe entire walk back to his store i smiled to myself not admitting that i had missed holding his hand let me get this straight lexi blaise said from our table at the leaky cauldron you ran away from home i nodded after your parents found out that you knew about draco draco planning to run away i sighed i knew i had a lot of explaining to do why was draco running again cho asked from next to blaise i shuffled my feet he didntwant to become a death eater i said quietly neither do i why didntyou tell us before lexi blaise asked i never would have let you go back with your parents exactly blaise i said and then they would ve known that i knew and that i told you and you d have gotten into trouble blaise sighed i had a right to know he said i nodded i sorry i bit my lower lip what are you going to do now blaise asked leaning back in his chair i dontknow i was thinking of getting a room here or somewhere nearby maybe in muggle london where they cantfind me so easily i shrugged dontbe ridiculous blaise said you d be completely alone in muggle london why dontyou come stay with me cho asked blaise and i both shook our heads if lexi going to stay with either of us it going to be me blaise said i can keep her safe i can take care of myself i said you should talk to dumbledore as much as i hate to say it lex just let him know you re not staying with them anymore i grunted he d probably want to bring me in for questioning try and get all the information out of me that he can blaise sighed anyway stay at my place where are your things did you get a room here i shook my head they re at george s i flushed as blaise smirked at me and cho raised her eyebrows the flat he shares with fred too oh does he share a bedroom with fred too blaise asked well no i said and cho interjected how do you know lexi she grinned deviously i groaned guys its not like that things between george and i are over okay because you want them to be blaise asked skeptically what i want doesntfactor into it so you do want to get back with him cho said triumphantly i no i mean ugh it doesntmatter if i do or not because it is not going to happen even if i did want it i said trying to regain my cool if you didn t you d just say so blaise said nodding so you know you do i thudded my head off the table can we just go get my things and decide where i going to go blaise paid for our meal and we left heading back towards the twins shop the bell chimed as we went in and the twins grinned at us from behind the counter lexi they said simultaneously looking as lovely as ever fred said indeed brother even lovelier might i be so bold as to say george added bold very bold indeed forge but not altogether unwarranted thank you gred oh please you two i laughed and tried to hide my embarrassment not only at the twins but at the looks cho and blaise were shooting each other at my expense we re here to pick up lexi things cho chimed in brightly blaise nodded and thanks you two for looking after her he said then looked over at me where are your things at i glanced up at the twins where are you going to stay george asked er well we haventquite decided i said why dontyou just stay here fred asked and i blushed and mumbled my response what was that it wouldntbe proper i said firmly especially when i still had feelings for george she ll be staying with me most likely blaise said i glanced at george he looked a little put out blaise it will be dangerous staying with you that the first place they ll look i argued i just i think it would be best if i stayed by myself somewhere they d never think to look for me at a hotel lexi they ll track you you cannot stay by yourself blaise glared at me you need someone there just in case it my parents blaise what are they going to do i asked look what draco parents did to him cho interjected softly i sighed and pinched the bridge of my nose where was draco going to stay after he left couldntyou go there blaise finally said he was going to adrian s pucey adrian pucey blaise asked blinking i always assumed me too but apparently he went to france to get away from it i shrugged you could go stay with him i sure he wouldntmind blaise said thoughtfully just until they realize you re not at my house anyway a few weeks tops then you can come to greece with cho and i i sputtered blaise i couldntgo on your trip with you first off and secondly lexi could stay here you know i mean they wouldntthink to look for her here and even so fred and i are both of age she doesntneed to go to all the way to p france george said his ears reddening slightly i glanced over at him and smiled remembering how jealous he got at the malfoy party cho glanced at the both of us and quickly said i think lexi going to france would be the safest plan at least until her parents exhaust all of their searching they would eventually look here because lucius saw her in here the other day right lexi right i said grudgingly can you write to adrian and ask him blaise said to me i guess so it ll take him about a week to get back to me though good do that and until then blaise trailed off and cho interjected just stay here until then she looked pleased with herself you two can take good care of her right i dontneed taking care of i said as fred approached me on one side george on the other we ll keep an eye on her dontyou worry about a thing george pinched my cheek blaise raised an eyebrow at me i shrugged and glanced at each twin at my side this was going to be a long week after blaise and cho left i wrote a letter to adrian asking him if i could take him up on his previous offer of somewhere to stay with nothing else to do until the twins closed up their shop for the day i sat up in their kitchen drinking butterbeer fred rushed into the kitchen george is locking up so i told him i d make us all something to eat what do you want i replied anything is fine really you can cook though i added fred stared at me incredulous lexi are you doubting my capabilities he asked seemingly offended i laughed you were he said throwing himself down in the chair dramatically george walked in what all this i thought you were making something george was cut off george lexi here doesntthink i can cook fred wailed george gasped abomination he cried i shook my head grinning you two are impossible impossible she says fred scoffed impossibly good looking maybe george grinned i possibly good looking fred finished with a laugh i rolled my eyes but couldnthelp but laugh along but i dontknow what we re going to eat now george fred sighed i dontwant to burden miss conrad over here with my awful culinary skills george nodded how can we remedy this problem the twins grinned at each other why if lexi could oversee our cooking then we couldntpossibly go wrong i shook my head i wouldntbe of any help they grinned au contraire love george said putting an arm around me you would be plenty of help i sighed and put my hands up in defeat fine fine the twins smirked george i am pretty sure that you dontadd that much flour i said trying to hurriedly grab the bag of flour out of his hand we had actually made a semi successful dinner of chicken stew and because of that the twins decided to try their hand at making desserts fred i also thinking you dontmix the icing in with the cake batter i called over to him and he set the icing back on the counter as i wiped my forehead with my hand george grinned at me what i asked he stepped over to me and rubbed my forehead with his thumb you ve got flour on you he said quietly thanks i whispered we continued to stare at each other barely noticing when fred excused himself lexi george trailed off putting one hand on my waist and cupping the side of my face with the other he leaned in and gently pressed his lips against mine i immediately wrapped my arms around his neck he took that as a positive sign and deepened the kiss as i threaded my fingers through his hair he pushed me back until i was pressed against the counter and moved both hands to my waist when crash we both jumped as the pan of cake batter fell to the floor footsteps were hears thundering down the hallways and fred came into view no he cried you ruined my beautiful creation he knelt to the floor and lifted his hands up to the sky why i tried to not laugh as i hid my red face in george chest he kissed me on the cheek quickly and said living room living room i agreed awe yay there you go some cute lexi george at the end i hope you liked it i sorry updating took so long i ve been really busy with schoolwork and applying to colleges i ve written far more essays than i have ever wanted to write but hopefully since i pretty much finished with all the written applying work i can be more focused on updating thanks so much for being patient sorry

apologize for what happens if it upsets anyone but i just couldnthelp it thanks to everyone who reviewed chapter 33 goodbye kisses france and temptation so i began so george replied evenly that was well uh what i mean to say is that that something that shouldnthave happened i managed to get out really george arched an eyebrow funny that not the impression i got i sighed george listen with everything that going on right now i canthave this happening too i dontknow george slung an arm around me lex i not asking for anything i just want to be here for you i leaving in less than a week i reminded him he frowned you donthave to you know i perfectly capable i know i interrupted it not that i tired of putting people i l lo care about in danger and i just want to get as far away as possible george smiled softly lexi you just worry about yourself all right he leaned down and kissed me lightly on the forehead i can wait i grabbed his hand and squeezed it tightly that not very fair all fair in love and war my dear lexi george paused and for clarifications sake we re dealing with the first one i blushed really now course it is i never stopped after all i closed my eyes and tried to slow my heart down george like i said i can wait he pressed his lips gently against mine for a moment i sighed and leaned my forehead against his you just do what you need to do i leaned away gazing thoughtfully at him you donthave to you know i know george sighed however it will be quite hard on you i would assume i raised an eyebrow why would you assume that because it must be hard to resist someone as handsome charming funny intelligent sex okay i get it it was agreed that i would be leaving for france on that coming saturday adrian was going to be picking me up from the twins shop but somehow dumbledore had found out and insisted that adrian meet us at the burrow since it was allegedly one of the safest places in britain at this point in time which blaise cho and i thought was simply ridiculous lexi dontforget your towels cho rushed into george room where all of my things had been put although i had insisted upon sleeping on the couch oh thanks i grabbed the towels from her hand and stuffed them into my bag i dontneed to pack much for a week right right the rest of your things are being taken to blaise summer house in greece you ll be in france for about a week and a half then you ll come back here meet us at the burrow and we ll go directly to greece cho explained i nodded this is too much trouble to go to honestly lexi we just want you to be safe you ready as i ll ever be you and blaise are coming with me to the weasley s right i dontthink i could go alone i admitted i didntknow how many weasleys were out for my blood and i was sure the golden trio would be there as well of course lexi we wouldntfeed you to the lions or anything cho laughed at her own joke oh lions gryffindors witty chang fred rolled his eyes good naturedly as he walked into the room got your bags ready lexi i nodded and picked up the bag i had just finished packing thanks fred he grinned at me you should be thanking me especially after you ruined my cake batter the other night i blushed as he left the room laughing cho looked at me with wide eyes lexi what about cake batter could leave you blushing i spoke quickly nothing nothing just fred being fred you know cho raised her eyebrows lexi cho really i leaving any minute now we ll talk about this later i insisted cho nodded in agreement of course blaise and i can get a lot of information out of you once we re all in greece you wonthave any excuses then i grimaced no doubt she and blaise would find some way to torture me into telling them everything we d better go soon or else they ll send the entire weasley brigade to look for me i muttered i still maintain that this is highly unnecessary and i maintain that you donthave a very good judgment on what best for you blaise smirked at me as he walked into the room although i do agree all of these bodyguards arentneeded he sighed nonetheless it time for us to go blaise and cho left the room and i followed we flooed from the twin flat to the burrow and arrived to find the kitchen more crowded in my opinion than any room should be or maybe it was just the company that seemed so suffocating to me i felt the tension between the side of the room that myself blaise cho and the twins occupied and the side that held weasley potter granger and mr and mrs weasley blaise stepped protectively in front of cho and i and i smirked at granger from behind his shoulder as dumbledore walked into the room well now dumbledore clapped his hands together now that miss conrad is here we ve just got to wait for mr pucey not long i hope weasley muttered mutual weasley blaise snarled back i put a hand on his shoulder it all right blaise cho said quietly dumbledore glanced around the room although it may prove to be a bit disastrous if mr pucey doesntarrive soon he mused i concealed a snort bringing his attention to me and how are you holding up miss conrad perfectly well on my own thank you i replied stiffly dumbledore smiled tiredly at me while hermione tsked under her breath it seems i just cantwin with miss conrad dumbledore confided to kingsley shacklebolt who had just walked into the room i rolled my eyes and we heard a loud pop from another room and adrian pucey walked into the room blaise good to see you he walked over to use and clapped blaise on the shoulder even hermione granger couldnthelp but eye him appreciatively and miss chang have you been keeping him in line he winked at cho who blushed and mumbled a response i stifled a laugh professor he greeted dumbledore with a nod of his head before grabbing my arm and unceremoniously yanking me into the center of the room right between him and george conveniently enough fred george adrian nodded politely at them having known them from quidditch fred nodded and george extended his hand the two shook hands for much longer than was necessary and when they pulled away i could see adrian flex his fingers quite a grip you ve got there george adrian laughed uncomfortably anyway we d better get a move on the portkey activates in about two minutes let me grab your things thanks adrian for letting lexi stay with you blaise said from the corner yes mr pucey it is quite admirable for you to help a student in her time of need dumbledore piped in while i grimaced adrian shrugged no problem i ll always help out a friend h winked at me you ready lex uhm yes i think so i replied flustered by the tension in the room not only between myself and the golden trio but between adrian and george as well i turned to hug blaise and cho see you guys soon i turned to the twins thanks for letting me stay at your place i faintly heard granger gasp at this but chose to ignore it i guess that everything i turned to follow adrian out of the crowded room lexi i heard george say behind me i turned and found myself inches away from him y y yes i managed to get out my heart rate increasing because of our closeness he smiled softly at me before bending his head down and kissing me thoroughly in front of the entire room he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me close before eventually letting me go see you when you get back yeah he smirked and touched my face gently i gazed up at him before the sound of someone clearing their throat behind me snapped me out of my trance and also reminded me to breath uhm i uh see you i offered weakly as i turned to follow adrian who looked fairly amused he nodded once more at george giving him a pointed look before following me out of the room i refused to look at him as he set up the portkey i touched the small muggle coin in preparation and counted down until we left at the last moment however i heard adrian say you and weasley huh i was glad he couldntsee my blush while we were traveling to france we arrived at what i assumed was the place adrian was staying for someone who had fled the country to escape becoming a death eater he certainly didntlack any comforts he lived in a small flat decorated in stylish white furniture and dark wooden tables in the sitting room well adrian sprawled himself out on a nearby couch you didntanswer my question love i blushed and adrian laughed guess that all the answer i need i sighed it complicated adrian grinned if the way he almost took my hand off is any indication i d say it was pretty simple i rolled my eyes i think that an exaggeration he did not almost take your hand off lexi i know a thing or two about guys and george weasley was displaying all the characteristics of a guy who wanted me to know that you were spoken for adrian smirked unfortunately jealously doesntgo with his hair color you can say that again i muttered so so what i tried to be nonchalant discussing my maybe relationship with the guy i had a crush on for four years didntappeal to me as adrian obviously thought it should you and weasley he exclaimed i wontbe mad you know you could do worse i glared at him i ll have you know george is a wonderful boyfriend and i certainly could do worse so you admit it adrian said laughing again you re infuriating if this is what it going to be like all week i going to hex you into next month i threatened calm down calm down he chuckled i only kidding i think it great that you can look past all that red hair freckles and the multitude of siblings he has to be with him i snorted first off the red hair and freckles isnta problem on him anyway secondly the multitude of siblings is well you can probably guess how that turned out thirdly we re not even together anymore so doesntseem that way to me pet well we re not i ve just well you know i ve got a lot going on right now lex that is exactly why you need someone to be with you right now you need someone to lean on and to talk to you cantjust keep everything to yourself adrian said gently i ve i ve hurt him a lot adrian i did some things mistakes and i dontwant him to have to put up with it again i confessed by the looks of things he thinks you re worth it adrian pointed out dontyou think he worth it i of course i do i exclaimed george is he just i really l l love him i blushed again and adrian smiled then it looks like you ve made your decision adrian leaned back against the couch and grinned at me in satisfaction i blinked what do you oh come on lexi adrian rolled his eyes why wait i dontknow i admitted well you d better let him know then huh i smiled guess so dear george you donthave to wait anymore i ll see you in a week i cantwait love lexi adrian did his best to keep me entertained while i stayed with him which was hard considering we werentsupposed to leave the hotel so i spent most of my time watching the muggle television adrian had in his suite i had questioned him a bit about it the second day i was there a muggle hotel i asked less conspicuous if i lived in a wizarding community i d have to live like an urchin or a gryffindor he added laughing no offense i smiled none taken it had been four days since i had arrived and our routine had finally settled itself adrian was actually a very successful realtor in paris mostly due to his edge over the muggle competition and spent most of his day in his in home office making sales i usually spent this time on the couch watching movies or at the hotel indoor pool or arcade we usually ordered out for lunch and ate dinner in the hotel restaurant adrian no offense but is hiding out always this boring i asked one day awe c mon lexi i sure there something to do i ve watched all of your movies even the bad ones i replied you could always watch some tv he suggested they re all in french i cantspeak french i exclaimed subtitles he reminded me i sighed i hate subtitles i muttered while turning the tv on anyway dontworry lexi adrian grinned you ll see your weasley soon enough i rolled my eyes but couldntkeep from smiling whatever you say adrian dumbledore contacted us after a week and a half to tell us i could come home that my parents had by all indications ceased looking for me around the twins shop and that i could safely stop at the burrow before leaving with cho and blaise we decided i would leave the following day that morning i was gathering my things up when adrian walked into the room lexi dearest i want to say how lovely it been having you here to keep me company he said pinching my cheek i grinned you should visit more often adrian you re always welcome at blaise anyway i sure i told him he smiled i ll make a note of it thanks to you too though for letting me stay i sighed i dontknow how i going to go back to school you ll be of age soon though right august they canttouch you then and dumbledore wontlet them adrian reassured me i dontwant to have to hide behind dumbledore i shook my head sometimes we have to do the things we dontwant to do because they re the only options we have adrian reminded me i looked at him and nodded not like you especially wanted to come to france right i asked oh well you know it was hard adjusting but i ve got my own place my own job i can still use magic he paused plus all the gorgeous women he smirked cheekily i rolled my eyes typical i grinned what time are we leaving actually dumbledore wrote to me this morning seems he blaise and george are coming here to get you in he checked his watch a little less than 15 minutes i glared at him thanks for the notice he smirked good thing you re done packing he paused could you possibly go and get lunch just order whatever special they re having today five orders i guess and have it put on my bill i rolled my eyes wouldntwant you to miss your last chance of ordering me around like a house elf i joked but headed to the restaurant anyway it took me about five minutes to get the food and take the elevator back up to adrian suite i frowned at the open door but shrugged it off i had probably forgotten to close it on my way out and adrian was a little lax on privacy so he probably didntnotice i walked in closing the door behind me adrian you canteven notice when your door is left hangi i stopped mid sentence and i dropped the food i had ordered it barely registered as the soup in one of the containers spilled out and onto my shoes as it hit the ground adrian pucey was lying on the floor in the middle of the living room a frighteningly familiar blank stare etched onto his face a stare i d only seen once before in my 4th year after the 3rd task of the triwizard tournament adrian i shouted running around the table and falling to the ground next to him i shook him hard in an attempt to wake him up adrian no i cried knowing it wasntgoing to work i felt my breathing accelerate as i tried to shake adrian awake please please please i whispered he was dead the words struck me like fire and i yanked my hands away from the body i had only a moment ago been shaking so fiercely i scooted back to lean against the couch but i couldnttear my eyes away from adrian cold unmoving empty body adrian i so sorry i whispered my voice cracking my whole body was trembling and i felt a lump rise in my throat i couldntmake sense of anything around me i couldntmove i didntunderstand how this could have happened how someone could have snuck in at exactly the right time to kill him while i was gone unless they had been watching us i was suddenly looking frantically around me worried that whoever had killed adrian was still around and then i saw it something that hadntbeen there before sitting on adrian gleaming coffee table was a ring a gold one one i knew the moment i saw it not only because i had seen it practically since birth but because the crest on it was so well known the ring i d seen on lucius malfoy finger for longer than i could remember shaking i forced myself over t the table finally taking in my surroundings it was far too clean in this room far too clean for a room where someone had just been murdered in the horror of the killing curse it left no evidence unless you knew to look for it i grasped the ring on my hands and stared at it how had he found out did he know i was here was it just luck that he came at the precise moment when i was out of the suite no i knew him too well to believe that luck had anything to do with it i glanced down at the table again seeing the note that had been left beneath the ring clearly for the first time it was s short note only two words i waiting struggling i got to my feet glancing at adrian body once more i felt my eyes sting with tears but blinked them back i couldntlet anything get to me now i so sorry adrian i whispered placing the ring on his chest looking at the clock i saw i had only four minutes until dumbledore blaise and george arrived i knew they d piece everything together far faster than i had that didntleave me much time i stumbled over to the fireplace and threw a handful of floo powder in malfoy manor it was dark inside the malfoy study and it took a moment for my yes to adjust to the darkness especially after being in adrian gleaming suite for so long alexis i heard a silky voice say behind me lucius i answered turning around lucius malfoy had certainly seen better days his sleek hair usually kept back in a neat ponytail was unkempt and messy his cloak wasntbuttoned evenly and his shoes werentpolished as well as they usually were i remembered vaguely my mother telling my father that lucius had been suffering from paranoia since draco defection it had apparently affected him more than i had imagined why i asked drawing my wand carefully from my pocket and holding it at my side just in case why dearest alexis i dontknow what you re talking about there was something different in his eyes as well unhinged no i said louder this time why why are you doing this why did you kill adrian he knew too much he knew what draco did i canthave any loose ends threatening to tarnish my family reputation lucius answered coldly tarnish i think you tarnished it enough when you put draco in st mungo s i exclaimed you tortured your own son lucius stepped closer to me and i took an immediate step back i was protecting draco as much as i was punishing him by removing him before he could put his plans into action i was sparing him the shame of his betrayal as well as the inevitable death that was awaiting him lucius sneered i was showing him mercy i felt sick this man that i had known my entire life was actually twisted enough to think that his actions had been merciful you re insane i shook my head and now what you re just going to keep killing anyone who you think has any inkling of what happened to draco so your precious master doesntfind out lucius twirled something in his fingers and the silver caught my eye a dagger there only one left he said icily my parents i began were the only thing protecting you but you ve run away from them haventyou alexis you re completely helpless now he laughed and it sent shivers down my spine you know with draco and adrian it could be said that a pureblood could have assaulted them just as easily as a mudblood but with you i ve decided to make it a bit different i was frozen with horror you see after getting into a fight with your parents you went to your little boyfriend house lucius sneered at my astonishment oh yes lexi we know all about it you stayed there for a week and then decided to go to adrian pucey house upon arriving you got into a fight with him and left coming here to stay until thing with your family cooled down this will be easily believed since you and draco were such good friends he smirked no oh yes i left to talk to adrian and imagine my surprise when i found him dead at his suite in paris i immediately knew it was the work of the same people that injured my son and rushed home to check on you unfortunately i was too late he paused and added maliciously an insane glint in his eye only this time they decided to do it filthy way they were raised i felt bile rise in my throat this wontaccomplish anything of course it will he roared lunging at me i jumped out of the way but in the process banged my head into a table the dagger for stuck in the sofa he yanked it out swiftly by eliminating everyone who could possibly incriminate myself or verify draco plans i am saving my family including him if anyone found out what he planned to do he d be killed he as good as dead already i gasped in pain as lucius kicked me in the side oh alexis so simple minded draco coma isntdue to what you saw silly girl lucius snapped i stopped by the hospital and placed a curse on him one that wontbe lifted until i choose to do so you mean he going to be okay i coughed trying to avoid the silver dagger currently being aimed at my chest i kicked lucius arm and heard a crack and seeing the dagger fly out of his hand tried to make a run for it lucius cursed and grabbed the back of my head slamming it against the ground i could feel myself bleeding and i was getting dizzy he wontbe okay when he wakes up to find his best friend dead at the hands of mudbloods so enraged in fact that he ll have no trouble returning to his rightful place at my side he ll never believe you i spat out red liquid from my mouth gagging at the metallic taste of my own blood he ll believe whatever i want him to believe alexis lucius summoned the dagger back into his hand and looking down at me sighed it really is a pity you had so much potential he plunged the dagger into my torso the pain was unimaginable i cried out in agony clawing at the place on my stomach where the dagger had entered i rapidly blinked back the tears threatening to fall and everything started to become fuzzy such potential i heard again the voice enraged me to the point where i could almost see clearly clearly enough to see the light reflecting off the dagger and the blonde hair of my would be killer i decided then that if i was going down so was he i summoned every ounce of my strength and tore the knife from my stomach holding my breath so i couldntscream lucius barely had time to react before i stabbed him in the chest he fell to my side as i heard him scream in agony and surprise i sat up and reached for my wand gasping for breath the fuzzy vision was back although i could make out the fireplace changing to green and three figures stepping out merlin lexi one of them shouted the others rushed towards me but i could see them getting any closer why werentthey helping me please i gasped out it hurts why arentyou helping me i tried to get on my feet but stumbled and fell against the couch covering my wound with my hand there something there a wall we cantget through another voice cried that would be my doing a cold voice said from behind me i turned and sucked in a breath immediately regretting the sharp pain in my torso from doing so v v vo i couldntfinish i knew i was losing my strength and fast it was taking everything in me not to lose consciousness alexis the high pitched voice replied i ve waited to meet you i couldntrespond here the voice said let me help you with that i felt a change in my torso a burning i held back a cry before i realized it was actually helping the pain was lessening but still there i looked down at my shirt and nearly vomited at the sight of all the blood my own blood the wound is not healed but it is smaller the cold voice offered my vision cleared and i looked up into a face i had only heard about to say he was frightening would be lying i was more terrified than i had ever been in my entire life i watched your little display and i must say he trailed off walking over to me you are a treasure he grasped my chin and pulled me to my feet i finally saw the destruction i had caused lucius malfoy was lying in a pool of blood both his and mine a dagger was sticking right through his heart and blood saturated his clothes i going to be sick i muttered tom a voice said near the fireplace i turned to see dumbledore george and blaise still standing there i had never seen any of them look so angry in my entire life they had been joined by the pink haired witch tonks mad eye moody and kingsley shacklebolt as well as remus lupin let her go he commanded why dontwe let the girl decide for herself dumbledore about who has what she wants the most voldemort replied his voice as detached as anyone i d ever heard alexis you would be quite an asset to my crusaders he told me stroking my hair i flinched at his touch crusaders i tried to scoff but my voice was weak against the filth these muggle loving blood traitors are trying to contaminate our world with he replied dontyou think you deserve this world more than they do alexis no no i replied my voice stronger his hand went from my hair to the back of my neck where his grip tightened they arentwhat you think alexis he tried to persuade me i can offer you so much more n no i shook my head but his grip on my neck tightened i coughed arentyou curious alexis he continued curious about who betrayed your best friend t his father his voice dropped to a whisper though i was sure everyone in the room could hear it i can give him to you he promised so many thoughts rushed through my head at that moment he could give me the person who betrayed draco anger flashed in my eyes at the thought of my friends fate i wanted to know who did it who was it i growled voldemort chuckled i have him right here he flourished his wand and a figure appeared in the corner waving his wand again the figure was brought into the dim lighting of the room no lexi blaise called to me it not worth it dontlisten to him i walked slowly mostly due to my injury towards the person tied to the chair i took the sack off of their head and gazed in astonishment at the face everything clicked mudungus fletcher mudungus fletcher who draco had been selling heirlooms to mudungus fletcher who my parents told me could be bought at any price mudungus fletcher a member of the order of the phoenix mudungus fletched sold out my best friend i reached towards his face shaking him why i cried out why would you do this to him why i choked back a sob because that how they all are alexis they are not your friends your family like we are they ll turn on you the minute they get the chance so dontgive it to them he handed me my wand you know you want to i stared down at the wand in my hand for a long moment before raising it i wanted to i wanted to kill him i knew i did then why wouldnti say the words my hands shook do it alexis kill him voldemort voice pierced into me and i jumped frightened by the close proximity alexis do not listen to hi dumbledore started but was cut off i could only assume he d been silenced i felt tears fill my eyes as i held up my wand again i opened my mouth suddenly all i could think of was draco draco telling me about watching bellatrix killing muggles how horrible it d been to watch i was afraid to look up at the mirror hanging next to the door across the room would i see the crazy eyes of bellatrix instead of my own worse would i see the red slits of the monster standing behind me i dropped my wand i can t i whispered voldemort hissed in anger before pushing me to the floor you re weaker than i thought he said maliciously before turning to dumbledore you can have what left of her old fool i felt a searing pain in my stomach and knew my wound had been reopened i heard the sound of someone disapparating and the yells of a number of people before the darkness claimed me i felt someone pick me up and place me on a magical stretcher you re going to be okay lexi i heard a voice say from above me i knew from their tone even then that they werentsure if they believed it i didn t wow so i sorry this took so long this chapter was actually really hard to write it was hard for me to write the part about adrian dying and lexi reaction and it was also hard to write an unhinged lucius writing voldemort was kind of fun though but i hope i portrayed him accurately please let me know what you guys think i d really love to know if you think i ve done a good job on the emotions in this chapter as i very unsure of some of them and your input would be really appreciated the next few chapters are going to be kind of fun to write as lexi going to be coping with everything that happened and the consequences it ll have on her relationship with george muahahha oh and i am wondering if anyone can guess what going to happen to draco now review please as always thanks to everyone who reviewed chapter 34 nightmares counseling and outbursts some people are lucky enough to be able to differentiate their dreams from reality some people are even luckier if they can tell the difference between reality and a nightmare i didntknow where i was of course i knew where i was geographically malfoy manor what i couldntunderstand however was how i could possibly be there lucius malfoy was dead i killed him then why was he standing in front of me and suddenly red everywhere on my hands on the dagger staining the carpet i watched in horror as the blood mixed with his bright blonde hair where was it all coming from i saw the gaping hole in his heart where it should be he didnthave one i looked down seeing the wound mirrored on my own body i didnteither i closed my eyes taking a deep breath it began again she not waking up i know you said she would she is stabilized she could physically wake up without harming herself her body only shut down in response to her wounds but they re healed then why isntshe awake she doesntwant to be draco i ran through hogsmeade looking wildly for my best friend again i couldntunderstand why i was looking for him here when i knew he was in st mungo s and yet here he was i ran up to him catching my breath as i placed a hand on his shoulder his back was to me draco i cantbelieve it you re oka i turned him around and stopped abruptly confused draco face was twisted in anger and pain i shook my head in despair what happened draco he looked down and i followed i felt my stomach clench at the sight of a silver dagger sticking out of his chest you killed me lex draco voice said but it wasnthis face it was his father s albus she needs to wake up soon every hour that she doesntis increasing the chance that she never will i know minerva her mind wontallow her to and i cantget enough of a glimpse at what she seeing to see why or how to help she buried too deep within her own subconscious you killed me pansy you killed me adrian you killed me fred you killed me cho you killed me blaise there was blood all over my hands i killed them i want to see her mr weasley that may not be advisa professor please i have to please as you wish the bell chimed as i walked into the shop another thing out of place an ordinary bell wouldntfit in here it was empty also strange the shop was too popular to ever be completely deserted i walked through the aisles one by one until i found what i was looking for george lexi please wake up george i whispered george please i think i think i ve done something awful help me please you cantdo this to me lexi i so scared george i watched in fear as he turned to me the same look of anguish on his face i couldntbring myself to look at his chest i waited for the words to come you killed me you killed me you killed me lexi please come back to me what i gasped at his words lexi lexi your hand her hand moved professor lexi please stay here i love you you you love me i whispered softly in an instant his face was free of pain and he smiled at me i felt so much air fill my lungs that it had been like i wasntbreathing before i love you too wake up wake up professor her eyes she twitching is that good honestly ronald brightness blinded me even before i opened my eyes bright i tried to mumble but the words came out slurred together she trying to talk a voice said loudly too loudly everything was too harsh on my senses too bright too loud too much i tried to roll over to muffle the lights and the sounds but couldntmove i finally felt my yes flutter open faces swam in front of my own as my eyes focused and i felt nauseated lexi someone exclaimed immediately beside me i finally took in my surroundings i was in a bright white room that would explain all the light i was also surrounded by a sea of red redheads sat around my bed at every angle george was closest to me with fred sitting next to him ginny sat on fred other side a the foot of my bed sat the two eldest brothers and their parents and in the corner sat weasel and the rest of the golden trio on my other side were blaise and cho i sighed in relief nightmares they had only been nightmares everyone was unnaturally worried about me after i awoke not so unnaturally i guess considering i d been stabbed in the stomach and lost quite a bit of blood george and blaise barely left my side during my stay in the hospital i soon learned we werentat st mungo s but at a private ward in a muggle hospital that was being used by the ministry in case of emergencies since a muggle hospital would be harder to locate someone in than at st mungo s cho and fred left only to get food and sleep while the family came and left left more often than they came after i woke up it was the second day that i d been conscious that i saw dumbledore again what he came to talk to me about was something i had been pushing around in my mind since i d come to miss conrad dumbledore said solemnly although we all know what happened at malfoy manor was an accident the laws must still be adhered to he looked sympathetic i didntmean i know and that is why i have arranged an adequate parole of sorts with the minister since no magic was involved he cannot technically strip you of your wand since it was in self defense he cannot technically have you expelled from my school by overruling me he could however tie you up in litigation or at the very least charge you with manslaughter i paled however after much discussion we have agreed upon your sentence if you agree to it as well that is what house arrest until the school term starts not being able to use magic until you return to school this fall although you will be of age in august being counseled by a person of my choosing and most importantly mentioning what truly happened to no one i looked down house arrest begin stripped of my right to use magic i thought of the alternative looks like i didntreally have a choice i nodded where will i be staying you cantexpect me to go back home i said not looking up at him he sighed it has been decided that you will be staying in a secure location one chosen by myself the headquarters of the order of the phoenix this time i did look up flustered i replied that wontend well dumbledore stood to leave i have the utmost confidence in you miss conrad that you will get through this ordeal he paused on his way out shall i let mr weasley and mr zabini back in george and blaise tried to get me to talk to them most of the time however they just let me rest but didntleave either the day finally came when i was well enough to go home or in any case to the place i d be confined to for the rest of the summer blaise mother however was still forcing him to go to greece with her so blaise and cho said goodbye to me promising they would visit everyone left at that point except george he was only staying until dumbledore came to get me so what the story i asked suddenly what do you mean he asked seemingly relieved that i was speaking for once i mean what are they saying in the papers i asked impatiently about how lucius died that he went crazy after what happened to draco you went to check up on him and narcissa he mistook you for an intruder and tried to kill you and his death was an accident as a result of you trying to defend yourself george paused they did a good job for once of not making the victim out to be the one who wrong would i be considered a victim i mused george looked at me for a moment of course love well i continued it just that all things considered i was the one who killed him you had no choice george said firmly i remained silent until dumbledore came after reading the note that told me the location of the safe house for the order number 12 grimmauld place we left quickly i apparated there with dumbledore and looked around me a dark dusty unwelcoming place greeted me home sweet home remus lupin was this a joke you re supposed to be counseling me i asked incredulously how are you supposed to be able to help me are you even certified george mrs weasley ginny and lupin stared at me as i paced around the kitchen my little outburst had been the most i d spoken in the two days i d been there i had my own room at the very least a small room on the second floor nearer to the back of the house my clothes along with some that i suspected mrs weasley to have given me were placed in a small wardrobe my bed was small but comfortable with worn sheets and a thick quilt on it the room was dark mostly because i didntopen the curtains but the light given off by the lamp on my bedside table was enough to read by which is what i had been occupying my time with reading became a great escape for me lupin managed a small awkward chuckle actually alexis being what i am i have been forced to find work in a more muggle climate and counseling was one of the many jobs i trained for i shook my head in disbelief and flung myself into a chair i dontneed this the minister thinks differently mrs weasley said gently i shook my head again well then shall we get started lupin inquired politely motioning for everyone else to leave the room so alexis or do you still prefer lexi he asked i shrugged lexi it is then i stared at him i know you dontwant to talk but i think over time you ll find that it good to discuss your feelings i bristled i dontneed to talk about anything i just want to be left alone lupin sighed you haventbeen to visit draco have you i looked at him for a moment before sighing no and now i canteven do that because i stuck in this hellhole how have you been getting along without him i here arenti i said my voice defensive change of subject then he mumbled adrian we are not talking about that day i hissed lupin looked at me and i glared back at him until he finally nodded how school been i scoffed it summer lupin he sighed and massaged his temples this was obviously going to be hard on the both of us lexi ginny knocked at my door dinnertime i closed my eyes and tried to lie still knowing she d open the door at any moment i tried to regulate my breathing as i heard the door open quietly i heard her sigh and close the door is she coming i heard an anxious whisper outside of my room she sleeping again ginny replied i ll have someone bring up a tray the voice answered i waited until i heard their footsteps descend the stairs before i got up from my bed i sighed moving my curtain to the side for a moment and staring down at the square below i turned back to the bed and sat down on the edge playing with a hole in the sheets i knew that no matter how hard i tried i wouldntbe able to sleep that night i had barely slept in a week and i didntfancy falling asleep at the table with everyone watching me i laid back in my bed and closed my eyes trying to block out images of what happened that day i summoned every ounce of my strength and tore the knife from my stomach holding my breath so i couldntscream lucius barely had time to react before i stabbed him in the chest he fell to my side as i heard him scream in agony and surprise i shook my head murderer murderer a voice taunted me no i argued i had to kill him he would ve killed me the voice asked you didnthave to kill him i defended myself and what about mudungus and i didn t but you wanted to the voice said maliciously you wanted to kill him i didn t you did you wanted him dead you wanted to be the one to do it the voice gloated but i didntdo it i argued but you wanted to you re a murderer admit it you know you are the voice taunted i sat up breathing heavily i took i my surroundings not knowing if i had fallen asleep or not had i imagined the voice in my head i ran a hand through my hair and closed my eyes i felt like screaming instead i stared at the ceiling my mind blank until i eventually dozed into a restless slumber punctuated by the nightmares that i had grown so used to i d known remus would eventually get tired of my silence during out little sessions but i hadntthought it would be so soon lexi he said gently i looked up at him everyone is worried about what i said dully you look at yourself you haventbeen eating molly told me you haventbeen sleeping by the looks of it i not hungry i cantsleep i replied monotonously you re destroying yourself lexi you re letting this tear at you from the inside out remus said concern evident in his voice you wontspeak to anyone much less me you wonteven talk to george he going to pieces about this lexi doesntthat bother you i felt a tiny prick at my conscience i had been avoiding george since i got to grimmauld place and had even taken to locking my door when he was there i didntwant him to see me like this i felt dirty you dontknow anything i muttered i know what you re feeling lexi i know what it like to lose the people who mean the most to you he paused and added quietly i know what it like to feel like a monster i glared at him stop stop it right now you have no idea i shouted just leave me alone i stormed out of the kitchen lexi stop remus ran after me i fled into the sitting room where harry ginny ron and the twins were sitting harry and george stood up lexi what goin george started go go away i yelled trying to run for the stairs harry blocked my path i tried shoving him out of the way but his arms held me tightly against him let go i commanded lexi you need to talk about this remus cried no i shouted stop stop trying to get me to talk to you i hate this i hate being examined like i some kind of freak i canttake it george reached us and tugged me out of harry grip saying easy mate i allowed george to hold me loosely in his arms and only then did i notice how badly i was shaking you re not a freak lexi we re just concerned remus began i dontcare i cantbe here anymore i i can t i ranted i canteat because i cantswallow anything without it making me want to vomit i cantsleep because every time i do i dream about killing everyone i care about and i am so damn terrified of waking up one day to realize that i have killed everyone that it wasnta dream i gasped for breath why do you feel that way lexi remus asked gently i barely notice the room empty of everyone except george remus and myself i m a murderer i choked out you re not george growled i shook my head i am lexi you had to kill him remus reminded me mudungus i replied you didntkill him george protested i wanted to i said quietly george answered hesitantly you you were angry lex no george i answered firmly i wanted to kill him i know i did lexi you had every right to be angry but the fact remains that you did not kill him remus pointed out but what if it happens again and what if i actually do it the next time i shook my head and turned so i could bury my face in george shirt i canttrust myself i trust you george whispered in my ear i doubt remus even with his enhanced hearing heard i think lexi that we ve made a lot of progress today i dontwant to push you to talk about more than you can handle at one moment remus said quietly but i do want you to know that no one here thinks of you as a murderer no one and you wontthink of yourself that way either soon enough i sighed i hope george perhaps it would be best if you took lexi up to her room she needs rest it been a rough day remus suggested george nodded and led me up the stairs keeping a hand gently on my waist he opened the door to my room and stood there for a moment before i looked at him arentyou coming in i asked he glanced at me you want me to he asked light disbelief etched into his tone if you want i replied looking to the ground to ah talk george smiled okay we walked into my room george closing the door behind us i sat down on my bed and george sat next to me you dontreally think that about yourself do you lexi george asked frowning i sighed i do george grabbed my hand and squeezed it s not true you know i shrugged george you just don t i paused you have no idea what running through my mind tell me then lex he implored i sighed and laid back on my bed staring straight up at the ceiling george did the same not letting go of my hand i just feel like everything falling down around me i said finally i used to have everything i needed draco blaise everyone in slytherin respected me then next thing you know draco gone i homeless adrian dead which is my fault i killed someone george you killed lucius malfoy lexi in the grand scheme of things you were probably doing the world a favor i looked over at him angry that what no one understands you look at lucius malfoy and you see a cold blooded killer voldemort right hand man i see so much more than that i ve known lucius my entire life he been like a second father to me which may not mean much but the thought was still there and i cantignore 16 years of knowing him i know he was bad and i know he was evil but i also know he was human and that something none of you see george squeezed my hand again i sorry i feel like there must ve been some other way i feel so guilty i leaned my head against him and he quickly slid an arm across my bed allowing me to rest my head on it lexi you did not have a choice george i keep dreaming about it except every time it someone different but it always the same i kill them george and the worst part is that in my dream i want to in my dreams i have a choice but i always choose wrong i sighed i hate feeling like some type of disease and i hate everyone else looking at me like i am one i dontthink of you like that love george said kissing my cheek quickly i sighed you re hardly an impartial judge but i am a handsome one and i think that preferable george joked for my benefit i gave him a small smile really lexi no one blames you for what you did i blame me i whispered i so scared george what if it happens again i nearly killed him you know i choked out but you didn t love that what counts really besides i ll wontlet you do something like that to yourself or anyone else if you canttrust yourself you can at least trust me george promised i sighed and snuggled into his chest i know i can george twirled my hair through his fingers for a few moments before i spoke again sorry you know for ignoring you a bit he laughed a bit lexi more like denying my existence i didntwant i fell silent didntwant you to have to see me i didntthink you d still i left my thought unfinished once again you didntthink i d want you anymore george asked softly lexi how could you ever think that because i an awful person i exclaimed and everyone around me gets hurt it my fault draco wasntsafe he got hurt making sure i was okay it my fault adrian got killed if i hadntgone to his place lucius would never have found him and made the connection and lucius i killed him and what about narcissa she doesnthave anyone now and it all my fault tears stung my eyes george wiped them away quickly lexi draco knew what he was getting into so did adrian dontblame someone else sick and twisted actions on yourself he kissed my forehead it not your fault just listen to me it not i breathed deeply trying to calm myself i tired of feeling guilty george then don t george pleaded with me looking almost desperate lexi i cantstand seeing you like this i sorry i apologized dontsay you re sorry you re not doing anything wrong love i just worried sick you re worried about me i asked looking away shyly course i am george wrapped his arms around me his mouth next to my ear nothing you do or think you ve done can change the way i feel about you he said seriously i shifted my body so our eyes met i dontwant to worry you george i just canttake being cooped up here left to my own thoughts everytime i start thinking it all comes back to me the guilt and the fear and everything i hate feeling so weak then george said leaning his forehead against mine while bringing one of our entwined hands up to his face i guess i just wontleave you to your own thoughts then i let out a small laugh you donthave to baby sit me george i dontthink of it as babysitting really more like having an excuse to spend time with the girl i cantseem to get out of my head you dontreally need an excuse to do that i mumbled george grinned delighted i thought not he kissed me quickly then stood i should head to bed though he gazed down at me for a moment an unreadable look on his face i stood giving him a tight hug thank you so much george i gave him a quick kiss on the cheek i dontknow what i d do without you probably get along just as well he teased you are lexi conrad after all i blushed right now that not much to brag about well she never ceases to amaze me at any rate i d say you re just hard to please i d say you re just crazy i replied maybe he winked and pressed a soft kiss against my forehead get some sleep love promise me i rolled my eyes but smiled i promise he smiled quickly before leaving the room i had to be grateful to whatever occurrence threw george weasley into my path that day in diagon alley if it werentfor his presence in my life i could only hazard a guess as to where i d be right now otherwise the guess i had in my mind wasnta pretty one i had just turned from the door when i heard a light knocking curious i opened my door slightly only to see harry potter peering back at me potter i questioned er lexi uhm conrad can i come in he asked wringing his hands i stared at him suspiciously sure i didntsit as i had done when george was in my room i wasntcomfortable enough with potter to do that did you need something i just had something to say potter looked up at me i couldnthelp but overhear part of your conversation with remus and george he paused the part about mudungus i felt the color drain from my face so potter was here to confirm my fears to tell me that i was a horrible excuse for a person and demand that i leave his god father house i just want you to know he began well it not just you that that happened to and it doesntmake you a murderer or anything the fact that you wanted to kill him i stared at him mouth agape what last year when sirius when bellatrix killed him he took a deep breath i followed her you know that of course you knew it at the shop this summer i remembered i had taunted him over the fact that i knew what he d done to bellatrix what he d tried to do you i trailed off i used the an unforgivable as you know he paused but for a few moments after it happened i wanted to kill her for what she did to sirius i wanted to kill him too for selling out draco i whispered sirius was the only family i had left and she killed him kind of how draco the only family you have left you know potter ran a hand through his already messy hair it doesntmake you a bad person lexi everyone has that anger inside of them that desire for vengeance but still i trailed off what makes you different from voldemort and the other death eaters is that you didntact on it you didntlet that side of you take over that what makes you a good person he stood there awkwardly just thought you should know i smiled at him thanks i paused then laughed gods who d have thought i d someday be thanking harry potter of all people potter laughed and who d have guessed i d be in here telling lexi conrad that she wasntall that bad that not the first time you ve told me that i pointed out it the first time you ve needed me to tell you that he responded just dontshut everyone out okay lexi he paused especially not george i think he needs you as much as you need him sometimes i smiled i not stupid enough to make the same mistake twice well you are a slytherin so it stands to reason that okay okay i rolled my eyes seriously potter laughed i ll see you at breakfast conrad dontmake mrs weasley send you up anymore trays all right i smirked i ll do my best i paused err thanks you know potter shrugged yeah g night he nodded only then seeming to realize the awkward nature of our conversation and left i sighed and went to change into a pair of draco sweatpants that i d brought along with me and a large shirt that i d taken from him the summer before last i knew i d always feel some kind of guilt about what happened and a part of me would always feel like a monster but it was easier now that i d talked about it i had no doubt that eventually the guilt would subside at least enough for me to ignore it and if george were willing to help then that made everything ten times easier now there was only one thing missing from my life once i had my best friend back everything would work itself out woo i am an updating machine i am not too sure if i liked the ending of this one but i really wanted to draw a parallel between lexi actions and harry in the ministry scene with bellatrix i hope i did all right with lexi freak out i thought it was fun to introduce remus into the story and yes he will be sticking around for a while lol as always please review with your thoughts on the story what you liked disliked etc and if it not too much trouble if anyone would feel like reading a one shot i posted for the monthly challenge it called surprise is a george hermione and feedback would be most appreciated many many thanks to my reviewers i love you guys wow 35 chapters i am thinking of ending this fic at the end of lexi summer and starting a new one about her 7th year at hogwarts just so this fic doesntturn out to be like 50 chapters what do you guys think thanks to everyone who reviewed chapter 35 loneliness and curing it things got easier after my outburst the next day i woke up early and showered before anyone else could wake up i dressed in a casual black robe i d found in the back of my wardrobe and sat on my bed for a few hours reading when i heard the stampede that usually signified the weasley boys heading down to breakfast i took a deep breath and headed downstairs myself the kitchen was loud and crowded i wasntsure why they didnteat breakfast in the dining room like they did dinner maybe because people came and went as they ate breakfast it wasnttechnically a sit down meal although the kitchen was filled and i tried to make myself inconspicuous i was of course noticed against my will lexi fred shouted across the room heads turned simultaneously towards the doorway where i stood hi i nodded slightly in his direction i stood there for a moment moving my gaze to the floor before sighing and moving my feet forward george grinned up at me and patted the chair beside him oh lexi mrs weasley clucked hurrying over to me as i sat down dear you have to eat something i momentarily wondered if it was physically possible to fit all the food piled on my plate inside of me thanks mrs weasley i smiled for her benefit george shot me an amused grin and rolled his eyes i ate quietly listening to the conversation around me the golden trio and ginny were having an in depth discussion not five feet away from me i watched them inconspicuously painfully aware of the similarities between their movements and mine and draco when we would be conversing on my other side the twins were going over some new product ideas with their father mrs weasley shaking her head at them disapprovingly i bit my lower lip and pushed my food around on my plate it seemed everyone had a confidante but me i was lonely i had been cooped up in grimmauld place for longer than i could bear to think of and i felt isolated from everyone i cared about certainly george was there but he couldntbe at the house all the time he had a shop to run remus was an adequate conversationalist but i was certainly not ready to actually speak with him about anything significant even potter had been attempting to integrate me into his conversations but with little progress the sad truth was that although i was lonely much of it was self inflicted nothing could ever fill the spot draco had left maybe blaise but as he hadntcome home from greece yet i had to make do with the people around the house it is normal to feel the effects of everything that happened to you more now lexi remus reminded me one day now that you ve got the time to think and reflect it going to hit you more heavily than when you were going through it i nodded it would just i wish i knew how he was doing you know shouldnthe be improving now that the spell lucius cast on him is no longer functioning remus sighed although you re right it was still dark magic that lucius used on draco and there are still repercussions the spell itself is no longer in effect but its side effects are i frowned and remus shook his head and smiled i ll tell you what lexi my schedule is rather full this week but i could check on draco saturday and report back to you if it would make you feel better i smiled you d do that i mean if it any trouble no trouble at all remus paused then added it the least i can do you cantbe having much fun being stuck here and yet you haventcomplained nearly as much as i thought you would i snorted so you expected me to complain remus replied i was told i was getting lexi conrad i didntknow what to expect i rolled my eyes sure lupin i paused er you will check on him then remus nodded and i sighed at least if i couldntsee draco i could send someone to see him for me i sighed and brushed some hair out of face glancing around the living room that currently played host to myself ginny mrs weasley and tonks i had been reading a muggle novel i found stuffed away in the library i had been shocked to find it especially in this particular house until remus mentioned that sirius had in his younger years taken to hiding muggle things throughout the house to infuriate his parents i assumed this was one artifact they had never found mrs weasley was knitting what i assumed to be a jumper while tonks watched in fascination having decided that she needed to learn more domestic hobbies whatever that meant ginny on the other hand was quietly humming along to the wireless radio that was playing kicking her legs back and forth to the beat another lazy day at my oh so sweet home away from home cue eye roll please the lazy day was soon interrupted when remus rushed into the room calling quickly for mrs weasley and tonks to join him in the kitchen neither ginny nor i moved as they slammed the door shut and began conversing in voices too quiet for us to hear we glanced at each other strange i commented before turning back to my book very she replied before closing her eyes had it been ron or harry here they would ve tried to listen in on the conversation had it been the twins i know they would ve joined in despite the fact that they were now order members and could just ask for the information they wanted to know always wanting to show off their skills the kitchen door opened and remus and tonks flew by pausing momentarily to glance at ginny and i i thought i saw the smallest of smiles on tonks face but i couldntbe sure what going on mum ginny asked as the weasley matriach rejoined us mrs weasley face was flushed nothing nothing at all dear dontworry your pretty little head about it ginny frowned and looked over at me our eyes meeting what was going on by the next day i thought nothing of the strange incident involving remus tonks and mrs weasley i wasntan order member and so i wasntconcerned that is until the twins arrived lexi i heard fred voice boom as they rushed into the kitchen looking lovely as always george squeezed my arm as he rushed to get some of the food his mother had been preparing george fred i greeted them fred sighed as he sat on one side of me george sitting on the other george george george it always george first with you where the love lexi he put on a wounded face obviously only for me brother dearest george replied i rolled my eyes and continued eating in silence i glanced up after the silence became too lengthy i d learned with fred and george that too much quiet was never a good thing fred was grinning at me in the most perplexing manner what i asked he grin didn t falter as he replied oh nothing nothing at all i turned my head in time to see george shoot him a warning look i narrowed my eyes in suspicion i d have to keep an eye on the twins something was definitely up i tried as hard as i could not to care or be curious but i just couldnthelp it i figured it was order business which was definitely none of my business but i wanted to know nonetheless i was sitting alone in my room at the moment waiting for george to arrive and wondering what the big secret could be was it a high security operation a raid on one of voldemort hideouts or a plan to stop an attack in all actuality i doubted it was any of these things although everyone was acting highly suspicious they didntseem tense or anxious on the contrary they seemed almost excited i heard a knock on my door and was shaken from my thoughts come in i called expecting george much to my surprise mrs weasley walked in lexi dear she began i was wondering if you had any plans for tomorrow i blinked and looked up at her what plans could i possibly have when i was under house arrest no not anything in particular i said slowly she smiled cheerfully then you wouldntmind helping me tidy up the library a bit ginny will be helping too i was confused once again because i knew for a fact the library had just been tidied not long before i had arrived but i agreed anyway sure mrs weasley she thanked me and left whatever was going on i was determined to find out what it was and i was hoping i could do so tomorrow george poked his head into my room hey lexi he grinned i smiled at him he d been busy at the shop lately since it was only a few weeks until we went back to school but he still managed to find time to come visit me i walked across the room and gave him a kiss on the cheek how business good as always george sat down on my bed and stretched how was your day i shrugged same as every other day i sighed i so restless george grinned you might actually be glad to get back to school this september huh i laughed maybe it ll be interesting to see whether my own housemates will turn me into a social leper george laughed outright i d say that would be a step in the right direction for you lex i actually hadntthought too much about what would happen when i went back to school but as it hit me all at once the thought of walking through the halls of hogwarts seemed to be unbearable for the first time i could remember my face must have revealed my emotions because george quickly asked what was wrong i dontthink i paused i dontwant to go back to hogwarts george sat up what why not i swallowed it just draco gone my housemates will think i a traitor i wonthave anyone you ll have blaise and me and fred if we decide to come back and you and ginny get on well dontyou george asked i sighed it not the same blaise has cho you have fred ginny has i paused far too many boys at her disposal in my opinion george finished i laughed fair enough either way i always the odd one out hogwarts isntworth going back to if i donthave my best friend with me george sighed lexi you ve got to finish school i stared at him in shock you of all people are lecturing me on the importance of an education george laughed lexi what do you want to do for the rest of your life i shrugged i ve always thought i was going to be a healer not exactly something you can do without an education eh i was silent of course i had to go back to school it ll be fine george squeezed my shoulder somehow i doubted it the next morning i woke up early quickly remembering i was supposed to help mrs weasley clean the library i showered and hurried downstairs meeting ginny once down there breakfast she asked from the table i nodded and sat down helping myself to some toast so why are we cleaning the library again today i asked ginny shifted her gaze away from her breakfast to me well she said slowly mum said something about a ghoul making a racket again in there and making a mess mad eye banished it last night and mum just wants to tidy up again it shouldntbe nearly as bad this time around i narrowed my eyes in suspicion but nodded weird mhm i frowned ginny was usually a lot more forthcoming with information well we d better get to it then she said brightly glancing at the clock i nodded and slowly followed her to the library the library wasntnearly as dirty as i anticipated and yet two hours later i was still there cleaning the most miniscule things under the watchful eye of molly weasley mrs weasley i finished scrubbing the cabinets over there i called to her before making my way to the doorway planning on getting a drink oh lexi wait she hurried over nearly blocking my path yes i asked trying to hide the irritation in my voice the library was nearly spotless for merlin sake i was just wondering dear if you could dust out those coats hanging over on that rack there may be doxies in there so we want to be sure mrs weasley asked i repressed a sigh and nodded i was nearly on the other side of the room when i heard that awful portrait of mrs black start her screams while that wasntsuch a surprise considering the clumsiness of that tonks girl what i heard after was and even dumbledore cantmanage to shut her up interesting a familiar drawl sounded i gasped and turned to see ginny anxious eyes peering back at me lexi she started but i cut her off as i ran out of the room and down the hallway towards the front door only to find come on now let get out of the hallway fred voice was loud i came to a thudding halt as eyes turned towards me there were so many people in the hallway arthur remus the twins potter and kingsley even snape was there i strained my eyes to see through them to the middle of the group conrad potter trailed off no sooner had my name left his mouth than he was promptly shoved out of the way by draco he gazed at me for a moment his mouth slightly ajar and i was sure my face was a mirror image of his the only thing i could possibly think of was that it was so unusual for draco to look so utterly shocked we both stood there for a moment staring finally he took in a breath lex i suddenly regained my ability to move and promptly threw myself at him my arms wrapped securely around his shoulders and i felt him stagger back then steady as his arms encircled me just as tightly i felt my heart race as i held on to him and my breathing quickened i shook my head into the crook of his neck muttering to myself you re here you re here you re here i whispered missed you too lexi draco murmured back stroking my hair i hadntheard his voice in so long i promptly burst into tears draco stepped back eyes wide lex he very nearly squeaked a crying best friend wasntsomething he was used to i glanced up at him to tell him i was okay but seeing his eyes really seeing them for the first time in months just as bright and icy blue as i remembered made me cry even harder i hic sorry i gasped it s just i broke into sobs and launched myself at him again better prepared this time draco quickly set to comforting me as best he knew how it all right it all right i just just so glad you re here i said calming down a bit draco smiled down at me a real smile me too we both suddenly realized we were in the presence of an audience arthur and kingsley were looking away obviously not wanting to intrude on our reunion potter was standing in the background a small smile on his face fred standing next to him grinning george was on the other side of him an unreadable expression on his face i coughed er well i paused draco eyes snapped up and he quickly slipped back into his stereotypical malfoy attitude if everyone quite done gawking i believe lexi and i have a lot to catch up on he grabbed my hand and began to lead me away that mr malfoy will have to wait a voice from the kitchen doorway said i flared up at once albus dumbledore was always ruining my happiness i thought bitterly what no why i exclaimed instead there are things mr malfoy has missed out on since he been away dumbledore reminded me gently things that he needs to be told about before anything else i looked quickly to my feet of course i had overlooked the fact that draco didntknow his father was dead more importantly he didntknow that i had killed him i sighed and glanced up at draco he looked confused i had to be the one to tell him i couldntlet the weasleys or lupin or anyone else tell him as good hearted as any of them were they werenthis best friend i can tell him i whispered the twins looked at me in alarm remus nodded dumbledore looked at me and sighed that may be best comes on draco i grabbed his hand and led him upstairs this was going to be hard i opened the door to my room and led draco inside i just it hard to believe you re here i said finally even though you re here you re right here it just i ve imagined this over and over in my head you know but it still so hard draco sat on my bed was it bad then he tried to sound nonchalant i was a wreck without you i told him simply draco patted the space beside him and i quickly sat down leaning my head against his shoulder i denied it at first you know everyone was so worried even the teachers i wouldnttalk to anyone about it even blaise the only person i wanted to talk to was the one person who wasntthere i sniffed draco brought his arm around me dumbledore tried to help i guess but i sort of yelled at him for not being more accepting of us you didnthave to draco said abruptly i know i replied anyway it was horrible being at school alone you had blaise draco offered but i didnthave you i retorted anyway nothing really happened until after the school year ended go on draco urged i tried to be inconspicuous i really did but obviously that didntwork my mom found out about george and in turn i told her i trailed off told her what draco pressed i told her that after what they did to you that that they should ve known i d never forgive them i took in a deep breath and i left draco eyes were wide that suicide lexi i went to adrian s for a week or two my eyes started to water except i stopped for a moment wait please i closed my eyes tightly it happened the day i was supposed to come back here what what happened i left to go get lunch when i came back the door was open i stared straight ahead and continued talking i had never spoken to anyone about what happened that day not remus not blaise not george he was dead i swallowed adrian just lying there on the floor i it was so scary draco i was so scared he was scary he was dead and i knew he couldnthurt me and i knew adrian would never hurt me anyway but him just lying there was the scariest thing a tear slipped down my cheek who draco trailed off uncertainly your father ring was lying on his chest i choked out draco hand which had been holding mine the entire time clenched tightly that bastard i ll kill him my eyes snapped to draco and i suddenly found i couldntbreath what had i been thinking i couldnttell him i couldnttell draco that his father was dead and that it was my fault lexi draco waved a hand in front of my face lexi lexi i sorry i said my shoulders racking with silent sobs i so sorry i went there to your house i dontknow why he tried to kill me i gasped out draco eyes were blazing what did he do to you i took my hand from his and shakily lifted my shirt showing him the scar from where lucius stabbed me draco gently traced the scar with his finger then growled out i really will kill him he jumped to his feet and headed for the door i scrambled after him he had torn down the stairs and was in the hallway before my words caught up with him draco no please wait i cried i not done draco whirled around lexi he nearly killed you he snarled he dead the words burst from my lips before i had a chance to stop them draco paused still angry but now confused i k k killed him i whispered draco walked back to me and put my hands in his lexi he asked uncertainly i stabbed him i said quietly i f f fucking stabbed him i thought i was dying and i cou couldntlet him couldntlet him live i couldntstand it i couldntstand to think of what he did to you what he was doing to me and think that he d get away with it and you know he would ve he would ve bought his way out i paused again more importantly he was planning on using my death to get you to change your mind about becoming a death eater draco jaw clenched then relaxed you had to lex he was your father draco i sorry if i had to choose i d have you standing here over him every time i sighed and rested my head against his shoulder i still sorry i not i then told draco about voldemort mudungus and everything that had happened at grimmauld place up until his arrival i hate to admit it but weasley is good to you draco said grudgingly not nearly as good as you deserve but i doubt anyone could accomplish that and he trying at least george has been very good to me i agreed far better than i deserved i was acting completely mental draco draco slid his gaze over to me sorry i left you lex i put my arm around his waist and leaned comfortably into him s okay everyone said it wouldntbe for too long i breathed in a sigh of relief draco was here and i felt truly happy for the first time in months i had everything i needed and with draco back in my life the future wasntlooking as horribly dim as it had been i had hope yay so terribly sorry for the longest wait ever i in college now so i have a lot of work to write around but i also have my own laptop now and since i in college obviously i dontsleep so hopefully i can update this more please

just letting anyone who might be offended by that know beforehand please review and tell me what you think of everything the chapter the pictures whatever thanks guys you re so great chapter 36 birthdays letters spies everything seemed to be falling back into place draco was back school was starting soon and my birthday was coming up in a week draco was already of age since his birthday had passed back in june and once i was of age and legally allowed to live on my own i felt things would be so much better for the both of us of course we d still be staying at the order headquarters through the summer i laughed to myself as i thought of draco rooming situation although i had been lucky enough to get my own room draco wasntso lucky and had been given the option of bunking with george and fred or bunking with potter and weasley he had of course chosen the former both draco and george insisted to me that they were getting along all right but i imagined they were both only saying that for my benefit as it were draco spent little time with anyone but me we were often in the library or in my room together i had worried that things between us would be awkward or strained but luckily we seemed to pick up right where we left off not saying that either of us werentaffected by what had happened i knew sometimes when draco wasntquite himself or when he got a certain look in his eye that he was thinking about all that had happened and although he seemed to be dealing with it well i never took for granted the fact that he was okay i knew at some point he d have to come to terms with everything but i certainly wasntgoing to force that on him what do you think it gonna be like draco asked abruptly one day what i responded turning a page in the potions book i was reading hogwarts this year draco closed his book how are we going to be treated we ought to be prepared for it i sighed it had been a topic i had been wanting to bring up i dontknow i confessed honestly i dontknow what story everyone will know or believe the prophet said that lucius went crazy and attacked me and my what happened was an accident i stopped but who knows who the dark lord told the truth right draco voiced my thoughts exactly i paused i dontknow how differently we ll be treated even if everyone believes that story it cantescape anyone notice that i ran away from home i put my head in my hands some excuse will have to be made draco patted me on the back the thing was we were both worried as shallow as it may seem draco and i had come to expect the kind of treatment our last names gave us both within our year and within the slytherin house the thought of being treated not only like any other slytherin but worse was actually very disconcerting i didntlike the idea of being at the bottom of the proverbial totem pole i think you ll be fine i said quietly i fairly certain that unless my father or rudolphus blabbed which i dontthink they d risk their necks to do so everyone will still think you were attacked by muggleborns they ll feel doubly bad for you because of lucius and you it irrelevant what happens to me i shrugged trying to hide my concern nothing can be worse than when you werentthere slytherins are brutal lex we both know that draco reminded me good thing i can give as good as i get i replied now that draco was back i thought every part of my life would fall into place and that was true for the most part the constant anxiety i d had while he was gone had left blaise and cho had returned much to my delight and the three of us had been reunited it felt fantastic why then was george weasley avoiding me like the plague of course he was busy with his shop and order business and i was busy tending to draco and doing the summer homework i hadntbothered with earlier but although that did leave little free time for either of us george hadntreally made an attempt to talk to me since draco had returned and i was completely baffled the trouble was that it was the middle of august not only was draco and i imminent return to hogwarts fast approaching but my birthday was in only 5 days i d never had a boyfriend during my birthday before and at this point i wasntsure at this point what george and i were and his actions were only increasing my confusion still i couldnthelp but remember all the things he d said and done for me while i d been so distraught over draco his sudden standoffishness just didntmake sense three days until your birthday lex draco commented one night at dinner everyone turned to look at me really ginny asked i nodded mrs weasley face broke out in a grin and i could practically see the wheels of her mind turning which after the celebration she d given potter for his birthday at the end of july had me worried you ll be 17 too then potter asked i nodded again while coming of age was supposed to be exhilarating i was unfortunately not allowed to use magic anyway as dumbledore and remus had been sure to remind me last week it no big deal really i muttered the last thing i wanted was a pity party thrown by a bunch of weasleys and gryffindors nonsense granger piped in suddenly everyone deserves to have their birthday recognized i gaped at her a moment glancing at draco quickly who looked equally perplexed ah t thanks i managed to get out if living in a house full of weasleys werentweird enough my entire world threatened to turn upside down if granger started acting kindly towards me i sighed judging by the look on draco face he was thinking similar thoughts i could only hope that some sort of normalcy would return upon going back to hogwarts i miss the way things used to be i said in what way remus asked every way well nearly i replied i miss the respect i had among my housemates i dontthink i ll have it when i return to school i miss the clear boundaries between myself and the people in this house i miss the animosity between granger and myself all the lines in my life are blurring i barely know which way is up i dontlike it lexi surely this is better for you though better than being a death eater you didntwant that remus reminded me but i didntwant this either i dontfollow voldemort obviously but now i feel as though i m almost as though i being forced into the order or at least onto their side by being here i feel like i donthave a choice i dontwant to pick a side i want out remus sighed lexi i know this is hard but whether you want to accept it or not a war isntjust coming it already here people have died lexi there no way out of choosing a side i nodded i i know it hard you have to understand it really hard i had a very privileged life in many ways and it hard for me to know that it gone everything changed and remus nodded not exactly in the way you d have wanted it to lexi i sure we all wish we could have our cake and eat it too but the fact is that to gain something you usually always have to give something up i swallowed guess i just used to having everything it was a harsh wake up call to realize that if i wanted to be free from my parent influence i would have to give up the perks of being their daughter as well two days two days two days until my birthday the thought sort of startled me as i left my room that morning what startled me even more was nearly crashing into george who had apparently been waiting right outside my door lexi george breathed out i smiled up at him nervously hey george we should talk he said quietly i nodded in response and turned back into my room george close behind i shut the door and perched on my bed what wrong i asked hopefully he d give me some reason as to why we hadntseen much of each other i not going back to hogwarts this year george looked apologetic i really tried but with the war heating up they need everyone they can get available for missions i stared off ahead and george wrapped an arm around me apologizing again but the fact that he wasntgoing to be at hogwarts wasntthe only reason i was upset missions i asked quietly george this is dangerous george nodded it is i wontlie but lexi we both knew i was going to do this i nodded i ll miss you i wish we d had a better time together this summer george swallowed sorry for avoiding you i just wanted to give you time with draco he paused also i wasntsure if now that he was back i sighed george i closed my eyes i guess i haventmade myself perfectly clear i love draco so much he been there for me more than anyone else he really the only family i have left and he obviously proven he d do anything for me the feeling is mutual i see george said stiffening slightly i grabbed his hand and turned to face him but then there you i smiled you ve treated me far better than i deserved after all the mistakes i ve made i admire you so much george because you re so good and it like you donteven have to try george grinned and i hesitated you told me once that you never stopped loving me he nodded his hand resting against my face i pulled him close and rested my forehead against his i didnteither never i smiled george i may love draco and nothing will ever change that but i in love with you and george cut me off by pressing his lips against mine draco and i arentso different you know george whispered we re both demanding of attention he used to having you all to himself i want you all to myself his arms snaked around my waist and he pulled me onto his lap i could feel my heart racing you know i said smirking at him in some ways george you will have me all to yourself i boldly pushed him down on the bed before positioning myself on top of him my lips crashing against his his hands which had been on my lower back moved south before he brought them back around to the front of my body moving up but stopping right where my shorts ended and my shirt began my eyes flew open as i felt his hand travel underneath my shirt lex he paused for a moment his voice husky you okay love i nodded quickly before bringing his mouth back to mine the next thing i knew george and i had switched places george ran his tongue along my lower lip and i gasped my hand clutching at the material of his shirt as i pulled him closer to me wrapping my legs tightly around his waist lexi he groaned you dontknow what you re doing to me i pulled away momentarily biting my lower lip nervously d did i mess up i had really just been going off of instinct at this point george looked at me and i was surprised to see his eyes were dark instead of their normal sparkling blue no quite the contrary please dontbite your lip like that his hand still under my shirt began to run along the bottom of my bra my heart was racing a mile a minute i d never experienced anything remotely like this before my body felt like it was electrically charged i quickly muttered a soft sorry and averted my eyes my lips forming a pout george hand was quickly pulled from under my shirt and he turned my face back towards his before kissing me hard i responded eagerly and didntstop him as his hands drifted down to the first button of my shirt unbuttoning it a little clumsily the rest soon followed george quickly learning i grabbed the hem of his shirt and with shaky hands pulled it over his head his hands were roaming all over my exposed midriff finally making their way upwards and we both sat up quickly as a loud knock sounded on my door i flopped back down on my bed in irritation george soon following and laying beside me i knew i was trying to regulate my breathing but i wasntsure if he was trying to do the same ignore it ignore it i whispered to him rolling over and kissing him quickly running my hands down his chest lexi draco voice sounded lex i closed my eyes and cursed under my breath george sighed and kissed me on the forehead like i said lexi you re hard to share he said smiling nonetheless as he helped me button my shirt back up before putting his own back on i blushed as he turned back to me dontbe self conscious love he put an arm around my waist and led me to the door that was bloody amazing he whispered in my ear before opening the door malfoy he greeted before giving my a quick kiss and leaving draco walked past grinning obviously i interrupted he gestured to the rumpled sheets on my bed grumbling i stalked past him interrupted indeed i agreed before smirking at his shocked face i take it you and weasley have made up then i blushed and draco laughed typical just wanted to let you know though that blaise is downstairs with some interesting news and an even more interesting idea i could tell from the tone of his voice that draco thought neither the news nor the idea were something he was happy about i quickly ran a hand through my hair about to leave when i stopped and cringed uh draco yeah do i uh look presentable i asked my eyes closed as i waited for the teasing response i was sure was coming as presentable as one can when they ve just been romping around on a be draco stopped as i hit his arm my face burning with all the dignity i could muster i headed downstairs when i got to the kitchen it was crowded with most of the house inhabitants being there as well as blaise dumbledore and mad eye moody lexi blaise gave me a quick hug before handing me a letter you need to read this it from pansy blaise what in merlin name is going on it seems this summer has turned everything upside down lexi ran away from home adrian pucey was murdered lucius is dead and draco recovered apparently though no one has seen him or lexi for weeks people are talking blaise and it isntgood they re saying that lexi killed lucius blaise i know what the prophet says but word around here is that there a lot more to it than that no one knows any specifics at least no one our age but a lot of things are being questioned lexi loyalty is obvious but draco is being questioned as well some are even blaming lexi for adrian death though i know better than to believe that all i know is with lucius dead draco hasntgot the influence he used to and lexi parents have officially renounced any protection their name may have given her i writing to you because i know you ll warn them blaise i can t i ve got my own safety to think about and i know what i have to do to stay on my parent good side i made my choice long ago but i know your mother never taken a stand on either side and you re free to do as you will so you ll need to tell them i dontknow what exactly is going to happen all i know is things at hogwarts are going to change this year dramatically i sorry i cantbe of more help but both lexi and draco better get used to the idea of being treated as blood traitors i dontknow how popular the idea of that has gotten but them being ostracized is a definite possibility they need to be careful regards pansy i sighed and set the letter down well so now we know i glanced up at the face around me losing popularity with my house isntthe worst that could happen i lied knowing there was much more to it than that this is about a lot more than popularity lex blaise voiced my thoughts so we deal we ve fought the gryffindors for year and kicked their arses no offense i motioned to the golden trio now the fight is just a bit closer to home is all that not all and you know it draco snapped my gazed flicked over to him obviously i aware of what we may be up against draco i paused and what this idea that blaise has got blaise shiftly uncomfortably lexi we ve been in a good position up until now with the three of us at the top of the metaphorical dog pile we never had to worry about people opinions or plans that obviously going to change this year you and draco cantget back on the inside at least not right now but i haventbeen tossed out just yet my eyes widened blaise you aren t mr zabini has kindly agreed to keep an eye on the other slytherins while maintaining the attitude that he has gone along with their ideas dumbledore spoke up helpfully in other words he going to be a spy draco drawled from his resting positions against the counter my eyes flashed towards blaise no absolutely not i wontallow it blaise eyes widened in indignation wontallow who to do what lexi you ve got no control over me i doing this for you guys anyway blaise these arentjust students we re dealing with these are the sons and daughters of voldemort inner circle we re talking about they ll eat you alive if they discover you ve been tricking them and if i dontthen we ll never know if they re planning to do anything to you two blaise retorted i fumed silently for a moment ridiculous why does blaise have to keep an eye out for anything isntthat your job i looked at dumbledore he nodded and replied though it is my job miss conrad i think student in this room yourself included has proven that with discreet planning thigns may fly under my radar i cannot be everywhere at once the golden trio had the decency to look ashamed whereas draco and blaise smirked as did the twins i was still seething so what does this mean blaise you re going to pretend that you re not our friend anymore i asked throwing myself into a seat obviously i ll have to distance myself from you in public he said quickly and cho she already agreed to stage a break up he swallowed he was serious about this what i paused what if we lose you to them blaise i knew how alluring the dark arts were blaise squeezed my hand you won t i promise i sighed and looked around the room i had no choice but to trust him george poked his head into my room while i was packing tomorrow we left for hogwarts my birthday celebration hadntbeen large by any means i think george talked to his mum about it and we just had a quiet dinner with some gifts i was shocked when mrs weasley gave me a knitted jumper even more shocked when remus gave me a book on transfiguration i was told by a reliable source that it was your strongest subject he said sharing a conspiratorial smirk with potter george had given me the best present i could think of he said he got the idea from potter as he handed me a mirror initially i wasntimpressed until i learned they were two way mirrors george having the other this meant that i could see his face very nearly whenever i wanted to it was the next best thing to having him at hogwarts with me so leaving tomorrow he stated yeah i frowned i ll miss you you ll visit george grinned like anything could keep me away love missions could i pointed out george smiled and pulled me close but you ll give me something to come back to i smiled against his chest you better come back always a lot of things were going to change that i was sure of i may not like it but i could handle it i ll make sure of it he kissed the top of my head i love you lexi i love you too george as long as some things stayed the same finished yes completed ah okay after years this fic is finally done but dontworry lexi story is far from over i hope you guys enjoyed reading this as much as i loved writing it thank you all so much everyone who reviewed especially you reviewers who stayed with me throughout the whole thing i really appreciate every single one of you i ll update this with a link to my new fic since a lot of you have this story on alert until then go check out the images for this story and its sequel aj so tomorrow i going to go get signed up for my new school 3 schools in 3 years i think my mom just get a kick out of making me my friends and i thought what better way to celebrate than to post a chapter of my george and lexi story thanks to the following reviewers there was a lack of george lexi in the last chapter but i kind of wanted to show what lexi usually does and who she hangs out with i trying to find an original way for george and lexi to keep in touch now that he out of school and i think i ve got it closet geek thanks and i know next to sirius the twins are my favorite characters they just make the whole series better they really didntget enough time to shine in book 6 and hopefully george will come around at least before i kill him off anyway no i dontthink i could kill one of the twins disclaimer none of this is mine except lexi and you know her cat and her crazy mother but i wontreadily admit to that chapter 4 moonwalks firewiskey and red hair pansy wake up we are not not not going through this again i snapped every year it was the same exact thing i would be the first one up drag myself into the shower get ready and princess pansy would get to sleep in because she just assumes i always going to be there to wake her up pansy i whispered if you dontwake up in 5 seconds i leaving 1 2 3 4 5 i walked out the door not my fault she didnthear me grinning i walked into the common room noticing a crowd around the notice board i shoved my way to it and looked at the sign everyne was pointing at attention sixth and seventh years a new class on business marketing and career education will be available for any 6th or 7th year interested please see you re head of house if you want to participate classes will be held in classroom 12b on the 2nd floor there will be various field trips involved including trips to various stores in hogsmeade diagon alley and a trip to the ministry of magic what do you think draco asked from behind me i shrugged might as well get out of school for a bit you know me you and blaise then we ll talk to snape at breakfast alright not pansy though girl bugs the hell out of me draco shook his head poor baby thats what you get leading her on draco sputtered i did no such thing i raised my eyebrows really the taking her to the yule ball and letting her climb all over you is your way of saying no draco grinned in spite of himself shut up lexi let us go to breakfast and get our schedules shall we i said holding my arm out we shall draco went to take my arm but i pulled away and ran out of the common room draco frowned at me in a mock angry fashion when he climbed out of the common room i walked alongside him so we re gonna have all of our classes with all the houses right i asked something like that the ones that not a lot of people are taking anyway you taking magical creatures i asked grinning draco smirked no and anyone who does just feels sorry for the big oaf i laughed and we walked to breakfast in silence where is pansy draco asked as we sat down i smirked missing your honey already drakey poo hardly but i think the ringing in my ears has finally stopped draco paused so where is she sleeping i said taking a bite of my eggs and you didntwake her up i tried i sighed but she didnthear me i guess draco grinned and exactly how loudly did you talk i grinned back loud enough owls swooped in overhead dropping packages off to various students i never understood why parents wrote to children on the first day honestly it not like there anything new to tell and they ve just seen them whats the point i asked as professor snape started handing out schedules malfoy conrad here are your timetables see you in potions dontdisappoint me snape said swooping past us professor he stopped as i continued draco blaise and i would like to sign up for that class thingy you know the marketing and business one snape nodded very well he said still swooping you know he swoops an awful lot where does he get all that energy to be swooping around all day you d think he have to stop for a minute sometime to get his ginger up i said you re crazy i stuck my tongue out at draco well then that makes you even crazier since you hang out with me he nodded that the scary part blaise joined us hey guys where pansy i turned my head away from him what is this national i love pansy day no hey lexi how are you just where is pansy and why didntyou wake her up aha so you didntwake her up draco said triumphantly i groaned i tried blaise draco changed the subject you ve been signed up for that marketing class with me and lexi blaise rolled his eyes great more classes just what i wanted puh lease i asked pouting i ll be your best friend hey draco said indignantly i grinned awe you too drakey wakey cuddlekins draco looked horrified blaise looked amused i can be both your and blaisey waisey poo bestest friend blaise grin was wiped form his face lexi draco said warningly yes schnookum wookum teddy bear i asked biting my lip to keep from laughing not funny lexi blaise said frowning i beg to differ my sweet little sugar puff i said i was running out of nicknames and fast blaise and draco glared at me if looks could kill i d be decapitated dead cremated and buried all at the same time fine i said huffily some people just canttake jokes let go transfiguration is first draco stood up hurrah yippee i so excited i said in a bored tone so no ones gonna wake pansy up blaise asked grinning i tried transfiguration didntreally start until 20 minutes after it was supposed to the delay was due to the long boring tedious speech that we heard on how important this class would be and how newts should be taken seriously george didnttake newts seriously i shook my head why would i care about george weasley the truth was a lot of things reminded me of things i had noticed about him he would suddenly for no reason pop into my head and i found myself thinking about him more and more often but why george had made it perfectly clear that he had wanted nothing to do with me and for a not so decent reason but he did tell the little weasel that i was cute that made me grin even though he was a prat he obviously had good taste miss conrad have you successfully transfigured your chair into a duck mcgonagall asked striding over to me hmmm snape swoops mcgonagall strides teachers just cantwalk can they well you see i was just about to transfigure it then peeves floated through the chalkboard and started making funny faces he completely broke my concentration i whimpered mcgonagall raised her eyebrow but let it slide let see you try then mcgonagall tapped her foot impatiently a n i dontknow the actual spell hehe transmorgificus i said pointing my wand at the chair and thinking of a duck very good for the first try miss conrad the only problem i see is that your duck feet are made of cloth mcgonagall strode away to find some other innocent daydreamer to harrass nice duck draco smirked nice otter i replied at least it fully transfigured he retorted oh shush your mouth i said trying not to grin draco and i had a free period next where blaise the poor dear had runes we enjoyed it even though mcgonagall set us an 8 inch essay about transfiguring inanimate objects into animate ones in all fairness chairs could be animate i pointed out you can make a chair move of it own accord right so really it should be an essay about turning non living things into living things i dare you to write that over and over til you have 8 inches draco said i hesitated i didntwant to start off the school year with detentions alright i said sighing draco smirked brilliant so what d you want to do i asked as we walked through the courtyard dunno let go pick on some first years draco said nah mean cold hearted and your point he asked i shurgged let plan a party you know blaises birthday is next week let go to hogsmeade and get some food and maybe some firewhiskey i said draco nodded sounds good to me we can use the room of requirement you know the one potty and his friends used for their secret club last year i grinned perfect from what i hear it gives you what you want then we wontneed to go to hogsmeade sounds good to me draco said i grinned and draco do try to handle your drinking a bit better than you did at the ministry ball last summer i handle it quite well draco said my grin grew wider yeah sure whatever you say i said chuckling as i sat in the common room later that night attempting to start my transfiguration essay george popped into my mind he had such nice eyes and he was very nicely toned too and that hair i just wanted to run my hand through it no i don t oh no i most certainly do not i shook my head and went back to my essay inanimate into animate how to transfigure inanimate objects into animate objects seeing as how any inanimate object could quickly be turned into an animate object i e a chair that moves on it own accord this essay really doesntexplain a lot i feel that it would be better suited as an essay on how to turn non living objects into living objects i then copied this multiple times until 7 1 2 inches of parchment had been used and signed my name at the bottom there draco i showed him the essay he smirked now just make sure she gets it dontgo and write another one lexi he warned why would i so you wouldntget in trouble he said returning to his essay i hope i said testily that you arentsuggesting that i scared of mcgonagall because i not of course you aren t he said waving his hand i rolled my eyes where is pansy pansy had come in sometime during charms which we had after our free period she had been rather angry at the fact that she hadntbeen woken up dunno went to get her divination homework that she missed draco said i see i going for a stroll want to come i said draco shrugged maybe later but we d have to go now i said it ll be dark soon and eveningtime is so pretty draco shook his head i want to finish this i grinned i ll let you copy mine i held out my transfiguration essay no thanks draco said smiling fine i going though last chance right nowww i said walking slowly over to the common room exit not really in the strolling mood hmph i said turning and walking out quickly i walked around the castle stopping every once in a while to talk to or insult a random person i finally stopped to talk to a certain person whom i had wanted to chat with since her break up with the boy who lived and is very insensitive towards the female gender hey choey i said walking up to the dark haired ravenclaw yeah um lexi right you hang with draco cho asked yup i walked alongside her so how are you i said kindly i alright i guess cho said listen i started lowering my voice it really pissed me off the way potter treated you last year if you need to talk about anything just let me know especially cho if you need to talk about him or his friends and any secrets you may have learned cho smiled thanks you know not a lot of people agree with that hardly anyone blames him for us breaking up at all i shook my head thats ridiculous it takes two to tango i mean i know i was a bit too emotional with him you know over cedric but it wasntall my fault cho said sadly sitting down of course not and who could blame you for being upset what did he expect for you to hop in his arms like miss mary sunshine i asked cho giggled really guys can be such insensitive prats yes they seem to be that way i sighed cantlive with em cantlive without em cho said shaking her head i grinned correction they cantlive without us cho laughed you re alright lexi thanks you arentso bad yourself listen me draco and probably crabbe and goyle i made a face are throwing a party for blaises birthday you should come it d be completely cool and plus then i wouldntbe the only girl there i dontknow i ve never really hung around with draco or blaise cho hesitated i waved my hand awe they re kittens really they ll love you cho grinned and i bet harry would be pretty mad if i were hanging around draco huh since they re like mortal enemies i smiled and shrugged perhaps boy did she ever want to get under potter skin this was going to be fun and easy cho grinned i ll be there i gotta go though talk to you later i nodded sure i called her back as she was walking away hey are you taking that marketing class cho shrugged i was thinking about it are you i nodded uh huh cho nodded slowly i guess it could be fun maybe i mean we get out of school right i grinned why else would i be doing it cho laughed alright then i ll go talk to flitwick great see ya cho that was the day i formed a very unlikely alliance with cho chang we were going to take potter down only she didntknow that yet you invited who draco hissed as we sped to our first marketing class cho chang she nice and she damn pissed at potter she d do anything to embarrass him i muttered back but why invite her to blaise party draco asked because if she going to trust me we need to hang out she in the business class with us too i said and plus i tired of hanging out with just guys all the time pansy doesntcount all she does is talk about you draco sighed well i guess it could be worse at least you arentinviting granger i grinned that only because she didntrsvp on time uh huh well maybe it was an owl mix up you d better go remind her draco said sarcastically we walked into classroom 12b on the 2nd floor to find a few familiar faces there were about 15 students counting draco and myself blaise hadntarrived yet cho was there with a few of her friends some 7th year hufflepuffs hannah abbott and her friends katie bell and one of her friends athena i think is her name the goldent trio much to my dismay was seated in the back on the right side of the room lexi cho said happily walking up to me i saaw potter glance over at cho he looked quite confused i grinned hey cho come sit with me and draco i glanced at her friends they can come too if they want and come they did because not one of them wanted to miss a chance to be sitting near draco malfoy resident bad boy of hogwarts bad boy as if blaise can sit on the other side of you draco i said taking a seat between draco and cho so chang what new at the waterworks draco asked i glanced at him he was testing her the moron because draco couldntbe seen with anyone who didntkeep their emotions in check although he frequently lost control of his cho rolled her eyes nothing cantwait for quidditch to start though you might want to try and catch the snitch this year draco draco smirked i grinned she passed chang can strike back who knew cho smiled that right and do try to beat gryffindor this year i think they re becoming a bit full of themselves i grinned took you this long to realize that cho they ve always been that way cho laughed draco smiled at me as though he were saying this one i like nice choice so where the teacher i asked checking my watch whoever it was was late as draco opened his mouth to answer me the door flew open and two heads of red hair huirried in sorry we re late a mad rush at the shop hope you haventbeen waiting all that long i had to remember to close my mouth whispers flew up around the class the weasley twins teaching it was the biggest oxymoron i had ever heard of can they really be teachers i mean they didnteven finish school i hissed to cho draco and blaise who had quickly slipped in i dontknow cho said wrinkling her nose well the oaf taught didnthe and he was expelled draco said disgust evident in his voice this school is going to hell in a handbasket blaise muttered i chuckled okay then said one of the twins i fred and this is george you can just call us fred and george because professor is just weird considering some of you are only a year younger than us we just sat there dumbstruck they had absolutely no idea what they were doing right then we should take roll george said i knew it was him i recognized his voice now when your name is called say here or present fred said taking out a sheet of parchment hannah abbott hannah replied with a present my head spun why were they here didntthey have enough fun pranking for 6 3 4 years straight so they ve come back to give us more grief that wasntbothering me really what was bothering me was the fact that now it would be twice as hard to keep george weasley off my mind cho chang george voice rung in my ears here cho replied alexis conrad he called i narrowed my eyes nobody called me alexis except my mother it lexi i hissed and i here he ignored me and went on with the roll draco nudged me alexis he grinned shut up i growled cho smiled if it makes you feel better alexis is a nice name i sure he just didntknow oh yes he did know i then proceeded to fill her in on my past encounters with george cho shook her head i dontget it he knew you werentbad why was he such a prat maybe he was trying to save face in front of his housemates she rolled her eyes what a jerk she muttered tell me about it i mumbled alexis honestly hermione granger granger hand shot straight into the air and she said present i exchanged looks with cho and we quickly stifled our laughter jennifer jones one of cho friends muttered here is the party still on cho whispered quietly making sure blaise didnthear yeah only there is only going to be like 6 of us i whispered back draco malfoy draco smirked and said yeah i grinned at draco can never follow directions can you what do you mean he asked innocently they said to say present or here you said yeah not much defiance there but you still didntlsiten i paused you cantfool me draco i onto you he rolled his eyes roll was finally over and then the class began so to start off with i sure you all know why you re here fred started george continued you re here because you signed up for it anyway this is a class dealing with starting up and running a business and how to market your product there will also be many guest speakers and field trips dealing with career education fred explained as if we didntknow that any questions before we begin george asked i grinned and held up my hand fred pointed to me yeah so exactly what kind of field trips are we talking here you ll find out when we go on them fred replied i sighed and leaned back in my chair so for today lesson we re just going to exlpain what we re going to be doing this semester basically we ll be seeing how much aptitude you have for marketing you ll be in groups marketing a product of you choice you ll need to convince the buyer which will be an unnamed panel of judges to buy your product your grade will be based on how much effort is put into your project and how well your product could possibly sell george explained i raised my hand alexis he asked i clenched my fists first of all it lexi secondly will we actually be making a product or will we be advertising an already made one you re product will be something that already exists but you can give it a brand name and put your own unique spin on it lexi he answered i glared at him i hate him hate hate hate loath entirely i hate everything about the prat how could i ever think he had nice eyes or hair or anything cool cho said you wanna be in my group i nodded cho and i are going to be in a group do you guys want to join i asked blaise and draco sure yeah hurrah i said so once you decide what you want to market come up to the desks fred said and he and george sat down side by side at two adjoining desks broomsticks cho suggested yes i said alright good one chang draco smirked sure blaise agreed i started up for the front of the class weaving my way through the clusters of students lexi let hurry it up draco teased from the back of the room i turned and made a very rude hand gesture shove it i said grinning i saw weasley walking towards the desk and my eyes widened if i knew anything about the goldent trio it was that two thirds of them were obsessed with quidditch i quickened my pace as i got past the last cluster of student i quickly hurried up to the desk weasley arrived just after me who is in your group fred asked lexi conrad cho chang draco malfoy and blaise zabini i said quickly glancing at weasley he was glaring at me what do you want to market george asked broomsticks i said simply i heard weasley swear behind me alright then fred nodded you guys can start have two people in your group go get a broom from the school shed i nodded and asked could we use a personal broom instead george nodded alright i turned and grinned at weasley he was still glaring i leaned close to his face ronald i started you re face will freeze that way if you keep glaring like that i nodded solemnly walking back over ot my group i sat down next to draco and cho i grinned well someone needs to come and get my broom with me i said draco volunteered and you guys start thinking of plans while we re gone we ve got a broomstick to sell draco and i left the classroom alexis draco said the minute we left why was weasel trying to bore holes into you with his eyes oh i think his group wanted to market a broomstick but i got there first i said happily draco frowned not that weasel the other one george i stopped what do you mean draco smiled and put his arm around me lexi dear the boy just couldntkeep his eyes off you he said grinning we continued walking really i wonder why he d do that i asked aloud well duh because you re bloody beautiful draco ruffled my hair i swatted his hand away draco you re going to make me blush he grinned wickedly it hilarious when you blush your freckles turn red and your face turns pink i looked away from draco no they don t mudbloods sucks draco said opening the door to our common room so you re gonna use your broom he asked yeah what else do i use it for that was true i had been given my broom in 2nd year by draco father it seems he got them all at a very good price by buying in bulk and he gave me one for my birthday i ran up to my dorm dug around in my trunk and found my nimbus 2001 not as good as potter firebolt but it ll be the best selling item since sliced bread i said sliced bread draco asked i dontknow it justa saying but people do buy sliced bread quite a lot i pointed out we walked in silence back to the classroom nice broom cho commented thanks i said now what should we name our brand hmmm how about lightning racers blaise suggested or maybe speedy gonzales i thought aloud everyone stared what i asked why dontwe just call the brand speed and then make that a specific version cho said thoughtfully or maybe quickster draco grinned i laughed i like that one i said all those in favor of blaise pasued and shook his head quickster my hand went up as did draco s slowly blaise and cho both raised their hands it such a cute name i said giggling draco muttered something and the nimbus 2001 logo on my broom was replaced with the word quickster what colors draco asked how about blue and silver i said a ravenclaw color and a slytherin color cho nodded and blaise shrugged draco flicked his wand and quickster was written in slanting silver block letters outlined in blue i like it cho said enthusiastically i nodded in agreement class was then dismissed and i hurried the quickster back to my dorm before heading to lunch hurry i hissed as cho crabe and i walked to the room of requirement we need a place for blaise party with food drinks and a lot of comfy chairs oh and some firewhiskey i thought this over and over while walking the specified corridor until at last cho said lexi look a solid door had materialized so this really does work i asked cho hesitantly she nodded oh yes and very well too i opened the door slowly oh my i said softly walking in the room looked exactly like a muggle nightclub only orbs of light were hanging evrywhere there was a bar filled with drinks and firewhiskey and cupboards filled with food there were couches and chairs on the far side of the room and in the middle what looked like a dance floor perfect for playin games i thought walking around the room everyone hide draco and goyle are bringing blaise up i said suddenly crabbe get from behind the chair it too small to hide you i said sharply goyle shuffled about and hid behind one of the larger couches okay here they come cho whispered she was hiding behind the bar and i was hiding behind a chair i dontknow blaise she just wanted to look for something up here i think she said she lost her potions book draco said well where is she blaise asked impatiently hmph seeing as how i in here at a party for you you shouldntbe impatient mister oh yeah he doesntknow that hee hee myabe she in here draco said i heard the doorknob turn what the he blaise started surprise we all shouted it a party blaise i said for your birthday cho added blaise was grinning i dontthink he had expected this and it made me happy to see him so surprised and pleased it really cool you guys thanks he said still grinning no problem it was lexi idea you canthonestly believe i d do anything this nice draco said smirking no i can t blaise said smirking back so now let uh i paused sit everyone nodded and i ran over to claim a squishy chair that was very comfortable dontyou think the birthday boy should get the best chair blaise grinned at me i snorted hey you re lucky you got a party we all laughed and started talking eating and drinking a few hours and a few firewhiskey later everyone was a bit tipsy ahhhhhhh i said falling off of my chair it the invisible dog i screamed draco laughed you re an idiot alexis he was currently sliding on his socks all around the dance floor dontyou see it i said stumbling over to him blaise raised his head off the couch all i see is you the drunken monkey shuddup i said i not an ape cho spoke up i dontsee a dog but then again i dun see anythin do i nope didntsee what an arse harry was didntsee that cedric was gonna kick the bucket i just stupid she said now now choey cho no one could have know that ceddy bear was gonna go and get all killed and as for potter i paused and draco said in a singsong voice you were blinded by the light i giggled and took my shoes off wheee i said sliding on the floor i know let try to get in the girls dorms and then slide down when the stairs change blaise hollered draco who was currently doing the moonwalk in his socks said yeah slippy slippy slippy cho sang let go i said marching into the door owww cho opened the door march and we walked out leaving crabbe and goyle inside where they had fallen asleep while cho marched i hopped blaise tiptoed and draco did various dance moves hehe you guys want to hear a song i asked cho nodded this one is for you drakey buddy draco stopped spinning and grinned i sang very off key i love draco yes i do he for me and not for you and should you try to take my place i ll take my fist and punch your face a n as far as i know no one owns this song except my friend who made it up as far as i know she made it up anyway bravo draco said loudly encore i tried to bow but fell on the ground laughing we then heard a voice say hey who there cho gasped and i said oh no it the fuzz duck and cover blaise being the most sensible of us when in a drunken state hid behind a suit of armor draco lifted a painting off the wall and hid behind it so his legs were sticking out cho hid under a carpet her feet showing and i curled up into a ball in the middle of the dark hallway hey come on i not gonna give you detention the voice said shining a light in the hall i closed my eyes i not here not here not here i chanted in my mind alright come on i ve found you the light shined in my eyes no you haven t i attempted a spooky voice i am just a figment of you imagination the voice chuckled you must think i really stupid or maybe you re really stupid or drunk he said lifting my up by my arms lexi i glanced at him red hair a stern face and it seemed like he had authority over me oh no i wailed percy has come back to hogwarts hey the voice said offended i looked closer and realized it wasntpercy but george george i whispered we need to get out of here percy back george looke at me bewildered lexi have you been drinking i giggled and shook my head no he frowned are you drunk george i said very matter of factly i swear to drunk that i am not god okay he raised an eyebrow wait a minute i said slowly repeating the phrase over in my mind until oh yes oh george said now is anyone else with you i looked around and saw cho shuffle further under the rug no one i said except my invisible stalker dog i looked down and to george left there he is i exclaimed i think you should come with me george said steering me away from my friends no i said you re mean to me i dontwant to go with you he looked back what are you talking about you dontlike me you re mean and just because of my house you hate me i said loudly so leave me and my stalker dog alone i said in what i hoped was a mean voice look george said softly you need to get back to your dorm before snape or anyone else who would really get you in trouble does i shuffled my feet stupid head i muttered yes i d expect you d think that of me but you re smashed so you have no room to talk lexi george said lightly grabbing my arm and leading me down the hall i am not smashed i squeaked yeah and i donthave red hair george scoffed i stopped and look at him reaching up i lightly ran my hand through his hair you have nice hair i whispered then continued walking thanks i glanced at him and saw him smiling you want to hear a song i asked uh sure he said i grinned wickedly it originally for draco but i ll use your name instead i love george oh yes i do he for me and not for you and should you try and take my place i ll take my fist and punch your face george laughed it a very nice song we reached the slytherin common room i dontknow the password i said staring i do george said brightly guess thats the cool thing about being a teacher blood purity he said then walked in i would later think thank goodness someone changed the password now you get up to bed george said trying to be stern i chuckled realizing how tired i was alright and george i asked yeah he looked at me if you see draco cho or blaise they were with me i said george grinned alright i walked up to my dorm stumbled actually and for once thoughts of george weasley were actually welcome in my mind okay this chapter is much much longer than the last one and has george in it now i know having george teach isntall that original but i have yet to see him teaching a business class so at least thats kind of different and yes i giving cho chang a place in my story even though she more like a vessel of information lexi thinks she may need to humiliate our 3 gryffindors and there was lexi george in this chapter although i not sure if most of it counted seeing as how lexi was intoxicated but i hope you enjoyed it anyway and i already got signed up for my new school and i have to take placement tests yuck reeeeview please hey there listen i getting rid of my internet on teh 5th and so i may not be able to get a new chapter out until i get my cable modem hurrah but i will be working on this so the minute i can i ll get it out thanks to the following reviewers milkshake gone bad hehe actually i ve never gotten drunk not old enough my mom would have me killed but i did get inspiration for the whole invisible dog thing this guy my mom used to date when he was drunk had an invisible dog named spot so i not exactly sure if it uncommon or not since he was a bit odd yeah i glad i donttake them til the 23rd haha i couldntget it out of my head either so i posted it so everyone else would have it in their head thanks juliathebedlamite oh dontworry fred and george are awesome i didntcry when they left but anything less than a grand exit would ve been an injustice thanks i love writing about george and lexi closet geek i know i was really surprised that the girl harry liked for so long turned out to be such a dud not in this story haha yay george is coming around maybe i should slow the process down grins evilly disclaimer is this really needed i hope not sighs chapter 5 hangovers hugs and feelings i woke up the next morning with the worst headache i d ever had lay a stomach ache sore throat and an incredible sense of embarassment on top of that and i was not having a good morning damn i muttered forcing my eyes open i had to blink a few times so that everything would come into focus i sighed my head was killing me i glanced over to my bedside table to see the time which was 12 48 thank the heavens it was a saturday next to my clock i saw a purple bottle with a note attatched i reached out and snathed the note opening it lexi thought you might like this hangover potion something i know has helped me many times enjoy it and dontforget to rub it in malfoy and zabini faces george i grinned then frowned george was acting like the great guy he had before and if i wanted to stay mad at him he was making it very hard but did i want to stay mad at him if he apologized certainly not however george weasley had never appeared as the type who would say sorry i groaned but took the potion anyway immediantly i felt the aches and pains go away yes i whispered happily but my relief was only for a moment with all the pressure of a hangover gone my mind immmediantly filled with the events of last night i put my head in my hands god i ran my hand through his hair and i wasnteven sober enough to enjoy it i shook my head pushing george weasley out of my mind i headed to the shower after getting out of the shower i dressed in jeans and a blue tee shirt with blue sneakers i didntbother to put on my robes since it was saturday and headed down to the great hall to hopefully catch some lunch luckily lunch was still going on when i got down there i quickly filled my plate with chicken stew adn started to eat a few minutes later draco slumped into a seat beside me he looked thoroughly disgusted as he watched me eat how can you stand to eat that draco asked propping his head up with his fist guess i just handle my drink a bit better than you junior i said grinning yeah right little miss my invisible stalker dog of doom draco teased i was glad to see that even a hangover couldntsap his sense of humor you were doing the moonwalk i exclaimed then paused although you did do it rather sexily draco smirked well thats something at least i still hot when i plastered hey not everyone is so lucky so what happened to you anyway well after your genius idea of curling up on the floor a brilliant hiding place might i add we waited for a few mminutes before trying to get back to the common room weasley found us though and led us back there draco explained then grimaced i was saved by a weasley he shuddered oh come on at least we didntget detention and anyway where do you think i got this handy dandy hangover potion i asked then sped out of the hall i giggled and hid behind a suit of armor which was much better than last nights hiding spot i watched draco come out of the hall and look around for me i held my hands over my mouth to keep any sound from coming out there was no need though instead of seeing me draco saw potter weasel granger and the miny weasley coming out of the great hall i held my breath excited well well well i see the golden trio has been upgraded to a quartet draco put on his famous sneer i grinned and moved slowly from behind the suit of armor things like this are always so much fun shove off malfoy weasel said angrily draco smirked ignoring weasley turning to potter he said so tell me potty how did you get into advanced potions you certainly canttruthfully say that you got an o can you i walked up to draco of course he can t he doesntneed to i guess being dumbledore golden boy does have it perks i drawled the fact that potter who probably only got an a in potions got moved up when the rest of us had to work for our grades had really been pissing me off for a while well you certainly didntget an o either conrad so donteven talk granger said huffily i grinned actually i did not that i need to prove myself to a wench like you eh granger sputtered and weasley growled donttalk to her like that i looked at him and a wave of pity almost consumed me he cared about her the idiot caring about anything it never got you much it i sighed at him weasel weasel weasel it ll always go one way and you know it weasley gaped at me i looked away and shook my head draco this is no fun they they re so emotional they dontneed us to make them miserable they re miserable already concealing secrets hiding urges it disgusting draco glanced at me alright you ve lucked out then he said to the three gryffindors i gave weasley a last glance of confunsion and left how do they do it i asked do what draco said linking my arm with his they let themselves be overcome with emotion they have no control they re children they think they re mature but they re children i shook my head i would go crazy if i was that open that vulnerable i shuddered yeah well i figure that makes it all the easier to get a rise out of them draco said but they never get a rise out of you do they darling i asked sweetly i had to admit draco did lose control sometimes but considering what he had to put up with i was very proud of my friends ability to remain composed no one gets a rise out of you unless you give it to them draco grinned back at me ah you and blaise catch me sometimes i said smiling he laughed and that is even better than getting a rise uot of the gryffindors i frowned and said in a mock offended voice why mister malfoy i though i was your friend am i to understand that i am just a form of amusement to you i sniffed draco leaned in and whispered a bit harshly you are not a form of entertainment pansy is you you re my best friend he finished softly i tried not to let my happiness shine through draco was my best friend and i was so happy he thought likewise i checked to make sure no one was around then gave him a hug i know you re my best friend too draco smiled i worried about draco so much next to george weasley draco was in my mind more than anything else speaking of which george rounded the corner looking surprised as he saw draco and i he then looked a bit angry honestly what does he think we were doing snogging malfoy no public displays of affection 5 points from slytherin george said sternly draco and i let go of each other very embarassed i looked down we weren t doing anything i said slowly george raised an eyebrow really yes even ask draco i turned but draco was nowhere in sight hey where d he go i couldntbelieve it leaving me to be raked over the coals hmph looks like he flew the coop george commented yeah i said absently he ll do that if you arentquick never did it to me though must be you i grinned certainly not george said affronted hmmm was my reply i then said suddenly thanks you know for the potion george nodded no problem how is malfoy holding up he seemed pretty drunk last night oh he as good as can be expected that probably why he left to get something for his head and boy was he drunk we all were i said shaking my head and smiling quite an array of people you malfoy zabini and cho george commented my friends i was suddenly defensive they re good people alright george said clearly not believing me i thought he had changed at least a bit but no he still judged before he knew people i lowered my eyes hey i gonna go i said not looking at him george tilted my chin up so i was facing him hey i sorry alright i sure they re nice to you but we just cantget along i wasntlistening all that well though george touching me sent shivers up and down my spine but wasntfrightening i couldntexactly say what i was feeling but i didntlike how weak and vulnerable i felt i moved away it not that i mean it is but i still have to leave george nodded i ll talk to you later though right i shrugged you ll have to right my teacher and everything he grinned at me as i walked away uhm lexi he ran over to me i stood an eyebrow raised a bit nervous so uh you arentgoing out with draco then he asked figeting i smiled no george draco means too much to me i wouldntruin it by dating him he my best friend george looked surprised to say the least perhaps the thought that draco malfoy could have a best friend even more surprisingly me had been unfathomable to him well gee is it so hard to imagine me having a best friend i not a loser you know i teased could ve fooled me he grinned i held my breath his grin was just so perfect see you lexi i smiled alright bye i walked outside hoping to find draco why did i let george affect me like that and why did he affect me like that i dontthink i d ever been so nervous in all my life i sighed things would be so much simpler if george would have stayed a jerk but in all honestly i was glad we were talking again that still didntanswer my question though why did i think about him so much what was this strange fascination i had with george weasley dammit i said angrily kicking a piece of the ground away i thought and thought and thought i was nervous around him my skin tingled when he touched it his smile and his hair his eyes i grinned then shook my head then i felt like i was hit by a ton of bricks my eyes widened and i felt myself gasp no no no no no no dammit no there was no way no possible way it cantbe it just cant happen certainly i couldnthave feelings for george i shook my head definately not that wouldnthappen it canthappen i took a deep breath surely i just over reacting i closed my eyes but all i saw was george face unbelievable damn i whispered angrily i did have feelings for george weasley however silly and school girl crush like they were and it scared the hell out of me draco returned from wherever he was about an hour later i was sulking by the lake hey he said sitting beside me hey i said softly gazing into the lake he glanced at me you alright he asked i nodded we sat insilence until he said with a bit of an edge to his voice you arentmad at me for running out on you are you i laughed quietly no draco i not angry at you he looked relieved but pressed then what wrong he paused did weasley upset you because if he did i have no problem with shoving my foot right up his a no draco he didntdo anything either intentionally anyway i muttered draco raised an eyebrow uh huh you know it d be really annoying if you were being vague i chuckled sorry i just caught up in my thoughts i said grinning trying to cheer up for him so where were you eh went and rested a bit you know since not all of us have someone to hand us a hangover potion draco smirked my eyes became a bit unfocused as i remembered who gave me the potion but i quickly smirked back sucks to be you then by the way where blaise i asked he said something about getting a shower then doing homework until dinner draco shrugged but it so nice out i complained i know but hey you know blaise draco said grinning so how was uh the earlier part of your summer i asked hesitantly with a father like lucius malfoy anyone would guess that draco wasntexactly treated in a loving manner by his father thankfully although i haad been hit a few times by my mother i never got anything nearly as bad as draco draco smiled nothing too horrible dontworry yourself he gave my hand a squeeze hmph nothing too horrible probably meant oh you know at least he didntuse an unforgivable on me however i nodded if you say so but i should think that you would know that i know that you make it seem better than it is draco nodded but i am grateful that you dontpush it i sighed draco let go in please the lake suddenly seemed a very publice place considering ginny weasley and her friends had just sat at a nearby tree we walked into the castle in silence where to i asked how about the library to start on some homework let go to the dorms first to get our stuff we walked towards the dungeons yeah i have to write that essay for mcgonagall over again plus the one she gave us yesterday i whined mcgonagall yesterday had pulled me aside to tell me that although she supposed there was some thruth in my essay which is why she wasntgoing to give me a detention i would have to rewrite it properly siiiiiigh god just because she has abso bloody lutely no social life doesntmean i as deprived draco sniggered yeah well that what you get for being a smart ass shut it i grinned reluctantly we gathered our books and headed to the library we walked in to find it not so crowded but crowded enough we saw blaise at a table in the back with damien draco nudged me and walked over to them hey guys i said sitting beside blaise draco took a seat across from me next to damien hey heard you were a little sally sunshine this morning blaise said his eyes were a bit glossy but he seemed very aware of his surroundings slytherins sure do know how to handle their booze a proud though considering our celebration parties always got a little rowdier than the other houses sure was you on the other hand seemed to think sleep was the best remedy ah well least you werenta chit like drakey over here i said smirking slightly hey nah actually none of us did that bad wonder how cho held up i thought aloud why are you doing two transfiguration essays lexi damien asked i groaned as that prompted draco to relate the whole story of our stupid dare which wasntmbarassing taking a dare never is it shows that you wontback down it just annoying yeah yeah completely bored here i paused yawwwn i faked a yawn draco rolled his eyes drama queen i leaving i sprang up dramatically i ll see you around guys i said trying not to grin a n one guess who i got that part from hehe i fled the library dramtically and bumped right into george weasley i stifled a gasp i felt like running and hiding under a rock or at least hiding him under a rock hey he said grinning down at me i began having a battle with myself tell him to go away it ll only intensify whatever you re feeling right o ahhh but his grin so tempting no no temptation pull yourself together and tell him off yes exactly i ll look in his amazingly beautiful eyes and argh no they are just eyes and they re reallyquite a vulgar shade of blue blue which looks so soothing kind of like a combination of draco and dumbledore s good and bad cold and warm could gaze into them forever hah told you so hey george i said enthused he obviously took this as a positive sign and continued walking with me what have you been up to he asked i smiled nothing just working on homework with draco blaise and damien george raised an eyebrow you sure have a lot of guy friends well i paused grinning wickedly if you think so maybe i shouldntbe yours just to narrow it down george smirked back never said i was your friend alexis i shifted uncomfortably my eyes darkening i would appreciate it if you didntcall me that i said quietly george looked down at his feet alright i was just joking i nodded and said a bit spacily okay george suddenly grabbed my hand and led me into an empty classroom wha what going on i demanded more than a bit confused look lexi i know i was a jerk in diagon alley that day i turned away from him yeah you were frost bit at my voice and i mean it was a bit of a shock you know i didntexpect that you would be a slytherin he continued what do you mean why do you assume tha the world is divided into good people and slytherins i asked angrily george you arentbeing fair well he said hotly slytherin is my rival house you arentin school anymore i said glaring at him but i was in school with most of the people you call friends they are my friends george they accept me they understand what i go through other people don t not because they can t but because they dontwant to i cried what is that supposed to mean he asked sitting down that everyone like the gryffindors mcgonagall even dumbledore would rather give us all up as hopeless cases then try and understand why a good few of us are driven to be the way we are they d rather turn the other cheek and keep their lives simple then do what people are supposed to do for one another help i said angrily they dontneed to turn out that way he protested you dontknow george you dontknow what it like why we stick together you ll never know because you ve never had to go through the pain we all feel the pain we share it bonds us we maynot have the same beliefs about certain things but we support each other and we keep each other secrets why cantyou tell anyone else your secrets his voice was softer becuse they wouldntunderstand most of your friends if they knew whats happened to some people they would pity them they dontwant pity i dontwant pity but what do you think about muggles george asked i sighed that all you judge a person on huh if you must know they re rather like some trinket in a cabinet fascinating yes but of no real use somethiong you just dontwant to get rid of though george nodded i knew you werentlike the rest of them you d be surprised george at how few really are what most people assume they are i said sadly george came over to me i am sorry about the way i treated you i didntme to hurt your feelings i shook my head you didn t it what i expected what i assumed george grinned then frowned but you still didnttreat me as badly as i was to you but i wish you would ve told me you were a slytherin still merlin that caught me off guard i shook my head i wasntaware at the time that you didntwant to befriend people based on their house choices i said coolly george got up this sintturning out the way i wanted it to i going to go and try and reword what i wanted to say i ll meet up with you another time alright i shrugged whatever as george walked towards the door i called his name he turned to face me you know george i started when i met you i knew you were a gryffindor that didntmake a difference to me george nodded i know he paused grinning in a teasing fashion it shames me to think a slytherin was more open minded than i i laughed awe get out of here go practice your apology stupid gryffindor i shook my head damn that george weasley and his sexy grin hair eyes body and now he decides to have a great personality as well bloody wanker sexily hot bloody wanker noooooooooo soooo sorry it a bit short i ll try and make the next one longer august 3rd 27 days sigh school blah reviews are appreciated hey guys sorry this has taken so long i had written about 17 pages on my computer and then it got erased needless to say i was not a happy camper but never fear i typed away made many spelling errors in the process but here it is even longer than the original and much better i must say i think a higher power was telling me this chapter sucks it will be erased and you will write a better one kazaam realizes how insane she just sounded okay anyway thanks to the following reviewers southernsweetdevil thanks i glad you liked the chapter closet geek awe well actually hermione has been irritating me but i dontthink she ll get killed off harry well maybe right after he defeats voldemort and does the whole save the world thing he could get sucked up by a freak tornado haha that way everyone could be happy mrs green thanks a bunch poor lexi i think she was a bit more flustered than george adrilily wow thanks the story may seem cute now but it will get very dark at times or it could just end up a big fluffy story i love writing fluff i liked the invisible dog too i thinking of having him star in another chapter haha thank you for the compliment on my writing style made me blush well i not sure if it did but it made me very happy anyway katherine i did try to give lexi more personality which is one of the reasons it a lexi george story instead of a george lexi story because i kind of want lexi to be able to be a character away from george in case i ever kill him off just kidding that wonthappen and yes i probably do make draco a bit too nice but i d like to think he d bee nicer to someone that he considers a sister than to his gryffindor enemies and really other than the premise of lexi and george getting together we haventgotten too much into the plot yet mg yeeess fred goodness i have something planned for him later on but i keep forgetting that he needs to be in the fic right now i also think i need to add some luna thanks for the review now onto the chapter i having major deja vu here and just for mg there will be much fred in this chapter hurrah for the other half of the walking circus that is more commonly know as the weasley twins and who had way too little of a part in this story so far chapter 7 snogs kitty claws and fred although my plan had been to talk with the little weasley asap i didntget a chance until saturday i woke up that morning very tired for some reason but brushed it off i hung out that morning with mainly blaise draco and pansy well not draco so much i was giving him the cold shoulder which was more like a freezing tundra of ice and snow but what can you do right so pansy what exactly happened last night i asked in a not so quiet whisper ensuring that draco and blaise who were a table away could hear us well pansy started excitedly draco and i were you know getting into it but he stopped because he said he couldntshag on an empty stomach pansy shrugged draco had a look of sheer horror on his face blaise looked quite amused dontworry hun he just shy the boy is completely over the moon about you i reassured her really she asked hope in her eyes really i said grinning as draco made a sound somewhere between a choke and a cry of outrage blaise had tears of silent laughter streaming down his face pansy turned around noticing draco for the first time since we d been sitting draco she squealed with newfound courage and ran over to him blaise stood up and jerked his head towards the portrait hole he left quickly with me following when i got outside the common room i found blaise laughing supporting himself on the wall hah you should ve seen his face lexi blaise laughed it was completely priceless i laughed he is going to have some trouble keeping her off of him now huh blaise shrugged his problem we laughed so blaise started nervously have you talked to cho yet i gasped i sorry i forgot i ll go talk to her right now i paused well it lunch right now how about after blaise nodded alright let go we went into the great hall which was filling up as lunch began blaise must ve had thoughts on his mind because we ate in silence while i ate i thought of how i would get cho to tell me who she liked obviously i would have to gain her trust but how most likely i would have to show her that i trusted her first i would have to tell her a secret of mine who i liked i grinned as i thought of george then frowned a bit i hadnttalked to him since the whole draco george thing in the hall the other evening not because i was avoiding him but because i hadntseen him from other people i had gathered that he and fred occasionally went back to diagon alley to check on their shop but i was definitely going to coerce ginny into telling me if he had feelings for me or not and i decided that i would tell cho about my george situation and by allowing her to voice what she thought on the matter hopefully gain enough of her trust to get some information for blaise my decision had nothing to do with the fact that i wanted a second opinion on what george thought of me that definitely had no impact on my decision really where is she i asked myself wandering the halls of hogwarts i had been looking for cho for about fifteen minutes now and had no clue where she was if i were a ravenclaw where would i go hmm ravenclaws are smart most smart people like books the library has books therefore it wouldntbe so out of the ordinary for a ravenclaw to be at the library thank goodness for my logic now off to the library this is so typical the one day that there should be ravenclaws at the library just to prove my point there are none not one single ravenclaw the library currently played host to granger a bunch of hufflepuffs some gryffindor 3rd years and some slytherins every house but ravenclaw i dontthink that even humanly possible i sighed and went outside no sign of cho at the lake or near hagrid hut smart girl and gryffindor was practicing on the pitch i looked through the stands and lo and behold there was cho seated by herself with a notepad duh i had forgotten that cho was made captain of course she d want to see how the other teams were playing honestly draco really needs to get on the ball with his captaincy or else the house cup will be yanked right from underneath his nose i quickly joined cho and sat down hey i said looking over her shoulder different plays that the gryffindors were trying were scribbled down as well as ways to block them hey cho said grinning at me are you allowed to spy on their practice i asked looking up at the team flying overhead katie bell ginny and miranda blake were chasers i didntrecognize either of the beaters but could tell they werentin any way as good as george and fred had been weasel was keeper and seemed to do okay at it when people werentlooking potty of course was seeker and instead of looking for the snitch was yelling plays at the team cho shrugged not exactly sure but hey they arentstopping me right i laughed cho glanced at me and stopped writing i was watching their team practice with a small secretive smile on my face what is that cho asked i turned my head huh what is what i asked in an innocent voice that smile cho said grinning i have no idea what you re talking about i said my smile growing larger alright cho said who is he i grinned girls were so much better at understanding small things than guys were we eell i said still grinning i ll tell you but i really dontwant it to get around you have to swear that you wonttell anyone i looked at her emphasizing my words in all the right places you have my word cho said i hesitated what if i was doing all of this for nothing what if i told cho how i felt about george and it turned out she hated blaise or something what if she broke her promise maybe i should make her sign a parchment and if she does give her pimples like her friend i motioned her to lean in well he isntreally anything more than a friend yet but i do like him a lot i paused then whispered george weasley cho shrieked oh lexi that is so adorable she grinned when did this happen i related to her all of my meetings with george with her awe ing and giggling in the appropriate spots and so the he says lexi i would only snog you if you wanted me to and walks away what the heck does that mean i paused do you think he likes me of course lexi how can he not after saying that to you a guy cantjust say he ll snog you and not like you cho reasoned but what if he only wanted to snog me i argued trust me lexi if he wanted to only snog you he wouldntwait for your permission cho said i suppose but i dontwant to get my hopes up i sighed dontworry he nuts if he doesntlike you cho smiled i laughed thanks by the way miss chang who have you got your eyes on cho laughed no one really i not going to jump right back in the dating game quite yet i really dontwant another disaster like i had with harry she shook her head no the next guy i go out with i ll have to know things about him at first she laughed i didnteven know harry favorite color george favorite color is navy blue i piped in we laughed hmm someone obsessed cho teased nu uh i protested my face getting warm i seriously do not obsess over things cho smiled whatever you say she looked up at the sky whistling shut up i swatted at the air next to her oh look they ve finished cho said getting up from her seat indeed seven brooms were currently lowering themselves to the ground cho looked over her notes yes i think this will be enough i grinned say how about giving me a copy of those for draco you know to ensure gryffindor ultimate demise cho nodded sure but you d better hope smith doesntcome to me wanting these notes as well she did a copying charms and handed the copied notes to me i rolled them up and slid them in my cloak pocket cheers i said grinning at her now if you ll excuse me i want to have a word with the miny weasley cho grinned good luck on that one i nodded and waved it had been 10 minutes and i was starting to get impatient it certainly couldnttake that long for the quidditch team to shower and change i sighed and leaned against the wall i was sort of hidden by a bush i didntreally want a run in with 2 3s of the golden trio i twiddled my thumbs and sighed finally the two beaters walked out talking about who they thought was going to win the world cup this year then katie and miranda followed chatting about the upcoming hogsmeade weekend weasel and potter followed and i resisted a strong urge to send them both a good jelly legs curse imagining the duo having to wobble their way up to the school about 5 minutes later ginny came out hey ginnifer i called stepping away from the building yeah lexi she asked shaking her head at my latest nickname i wanna talk to you she shrugged alright then over by the lake we headed over to the lake and sat down by a beech tree so what new i asked casually nothing really quidditch practice although i sure you saw that she grinned i shrugged wasntpaying all that much attention i paused so you still going out with thomas ginny half shrugged yeah but he getting kind of possessive so i trying to figure out a way to let him down gently i rolled my eyes darling anytime you dump a guy they consider it a major blow to their ego there no such thing to them as a gentle let down the only thing that worse than you telling them it over is you cheating on them ginny nodded well i dontplan on becoming as ron would say a scarlet woman i snorted scarlet woman where d he get that magical love monthly i asked referring to a magazine that was popular among people like my mother ginny shook her head no clue sometimes that boy makes me wonder so thomas is possessive you say in what way wonttrust you by yourself around other guys or just hates for you to talk to guys in general i flicked a leaf off of my lap she sighed both and more damn sometimes i think he gets jealous when i talk to fred and george eeeww what a nasty little mind he must have i commented unless i grinned ginny laughed oh shut up on that note however i see you and george are talking again yeah we are i said shrugging but hey he apologized so i wasntgoing to be mean and hold a grudge forever ginny nodded he seemed in much better spirits after you were done talking to him i cocked my head to one side what d he say to you anyway i saw him say something then look at me ginny laughed just asking me how i knew you i think he was worried that i might have told you embarrassing stories about him ooooh donti wish i thought so heh taking your owls this year eh i asked stretching back on the ground ginny groaned it horrible the first day of school they should ve just gathered us in the great hall and had every teacher come and give their speech at one time i laughed it only gets worse you get one twice as long next year about your newts i shook my head she sighed oh the joys of school i nodded by the way how do fred and george like being able to give out detentions instead of receive them i grinned ginny chuckled dunno bet they ve tried giving about a million to zacharius smith though and probably anyone else they didntlike i scoffed such abuse of their power it shameful ginny laughed indeed it is however it fred and george we re talking about so what else is there to expect what are you expecting gingersnap a voice said from behind us it was fred he looked exactly like george but i knew it wasnthim since i didntfeel the same attraction to him as i did to george we were just talking about how it would be very likely for you and george to abuse your power as teachers ginny said scooting over so fred could sit next to her it pains me to think you tell your friends such blatant lies about us gin fred said aghast he peered over at me say arentyou in that marketing class you re the one whose group is marketing broomsticks i nodded yup that would be me lexi fred eyes widened lexi he turned to ginny this is lexi the lexi she nodded he turned to me you re lexi he grinned i grinned the lexi i wasntexactly aware i had a title well see last time i checked i was lexi and it would really be a pain in the arse if they ve gone and changed my name on me i hesitated would that grin be a good thing or a bad thing fred shrugged depends on who you re talking about not exactly good for george since i talking without his supervision to the girl he ginny elbowed him in the ribcage ouch ginny you know you ve got elbows that are as pointy as knives i chuckled uh huh unless i mistaken i pretty sure you were about to say something you arentsupposed to so i gonna leave and let pointy elbows here give you a good talking to i stood up nice to meet you though fred grinned pleasure all mine glad to see i know what all the hubbub is about now i felt myself blush yeah well see you guys i headed towards the castle hmm fred is almost as charming as george and what did he mean by what all the hubbub is about i shook my head sometimes it was way too hard to try and decode the weasley insane messages my conversation iwht ginny hadntbeen nearly as information as i d hoped it looked as though i d have to find out for myself what george thought of me take the proverbial bull by the horns i guess but how i thought and thought as i walked towards the common room i thought so hard i even bumped into a few students or rather they bumped into me that what i told them anyway then finally as the entrance to the common room came into sight i got it brilliant is what this idea was absolutely brilliant okay maybe it wasntbrilliant exactly but it sounded pretty funny and was better than any other ideas i d had i ran quickly to my dorm and seeing as we had about four hours until dinner i figured i had ample time to turn said idea into an actual happening if the dungeons didntecho so badly i would ve laughed wickedly to myself but seeing as how they did i decided not to risk being labeled a complete loony nut job which i not thank you no matter what professor vector says he is just a wet match in a dark cave and a wet match in a dark cave never does you much good trust me i grinned and looked at myself in the mirror i had straightened my hair that morning and it was still straight and down i was wearing faded blue jeans black sneakers and a black tee shirt with the weird sisters written in pink all in all i thought i looked pretty good i walked out of my dorm the common room was pretty much empty except for a few second years playing gobstones how exciting i left the common room keeping on the lookout for any of my friends just in case they tried to sidetrack me nothing was going to distract me nothing except for the fact that i dontknow where george office is darn it i looked around hoping to see someone who could tell me what i needed i spotted ginny talking to weasley and potter i grinned hey i called the group turned to me ginny smiling slightly and potty and weasel glaring so red i have to ask you something i said ignoring the other two yeah lexi ginny smirked hmmm cantvery well say i need to know where george office is so that i can perform my most brilliant idea instead i sighed you re brother george i think gave me detention and i supposed to go to his office i paused and rolled my eyes for effect problem is the wanker forgot to tell me where his office is so red i afraid that if you donttell me where it is and i miss my detention it ll be all on your shoulders i shrugged potty and weasel were shooting me very mean glares canta girl ask for directions geesh i know men never do but come on ginny chuckled yeah alright it on the 4th floor you know across from the painting of merlin cantmiss it unless you re an idiot weasley glared donthelp her ginny and you dontcall her red he said to me ginny glared back ron shut up she was asking me something not you i smirked and weasel i would ve given you a nickname but i thought you were happy with ickle ronniekins i laughed at the shock and anger on his face wha you and i ronnieki argh weasley face turned a brilliant shade of purple he looked rather like a plum that had been squirted with ketchup a plum with ketchup yuck ginny was snorting while trying to conceal her laughter potty looked torn between wanting to laugh and sticking up for his plum faced friend well unfortunately potty weasel i ll be seeing you i said coldly stalking off just because i was friendly with george and maybe ginny didntmean i wanted to be a surrogate member of the weasley clan and it certainly didntmean i hated potty granger or weasel any less on the contrary on the rare occasions when i wasntcompletely rude to them i simply wanted to play with their heads i sighed happily yes annoying gryffindors was like a guy shagging pansy fun and easy i grinned knowing i would never in a million years tell her this i quickly snapped out of my thoughts nearly missing the painting of merlin i looked at the two identical doors i was facing the twin each had an office of course just my luck hmmm i tried using my superior intellect to decided who office was who s i then remembered something george had said to me it always fred and george never can be george and fred i ll never know why his voice ran through my head so if that were true it would be logical for fred office to be on the right and george to be on the left i nodded to myself and smoothed my outfit and hair before knocking on the left door a few moments later the door was yanked open hey fred grinned what are you doing here lexi dammit wrong door uhm actually i kind of got the wrong door i shrugged apologetically at fred not that i wouldntwant to visit you fred it just i need to talk to george fred sighed oh fine just break a young lad heart break your heart i barely know you i laughed well then go off to your georgie quite sad really you re the first girl to choose him over me fred shrugged his shoulders although i do freely admit i much better looking i started but you guys are almost identical i paused except for george is much better looking than you i grinned wickedly fred looked very offended well he teased i know someone who going to be failing her marketing class he shut the door in my face i grinned fred was really funny like george but he seemed to treat me differently than george did more like someone who was a friend well george treated me like a friend too but it was different somehow i shrugged and knocked on the door on the right george stuck his head out of the door hey it past cur he stopped grinning hey lexi hey i said grinning back i stood there for a few moments george staring back at me i smiled and cleared my throat oh come in george opened the door it was a normal looking office with a desk filing cabinet and chairs but it also had a bulletin board and a couch so what going on lexi george smiled at her here goes operation my brilliant idea is about to begin but now the idea doesntseem as brilliant as it was before still seems funny though renaming operation my brilliant idea will now be called operation my outrageously laugh inducing idea or for short op moli i shrugged nothing george looked confused well then why are you here i grinned wickedly why george i thought you would ve known you did say that if i wanted you d snog me didntyou i said feigning innocence george gaped at me what he asked blinking i continued to grin that what you told me right you said i d only snog you if you wanted me to well i do i paused and bit my lower lip unless you dontwant to kiss me hah take that you fiend i turning your own words against you that what you get when you mess with lexi conrad george strode over his eyes blazing alright then he said grabbing me around the waist and smashing his lips against mine i was in total shock for a moment before i started to kiss back my arms instinctively wrapped themselves around his neck and my hands were playing with his hair george weasley had to be the best kisser i had ever met it was amazing it was everything every other kiss i had ever had wasnt he was fierce demanding passionate and gentle all at the same bloody time we stopped for a moment to take a breath umm i said backing away george i george face paled are you going to yell at me for kissing you because really lexi you cantjust say what you said and expect me not to want george i said i i just wanted to know if you really liked me i paused which that didntwork out so well because i still not too sure lexi george said sternly putting his hands on my waist i would never wait for a girl to give me permission to snog her if i didnt really like her he smiled warmly at me well what do you know cho was right i smiled back well that makes me feel a lot more comfortable doing this i pulled him in for another kiss we found our way over to the couch and sat down snogging at the same time a n you ll find that in my stories there is always a couch in the most appropriate places george weasley tasted like chocolate and oranges which just happen to be my two very favorite tastes george and i were sitting on the couch comfortably with me curled up on his lap mmmm i said grinning at him how long have we been here he shrugged smiling back over an hour at least he paused then laughed what possessed you to come and ask me to snog you i blushed i not sure would you rather i hadn t i smirked he pinched my nose affectionately course not he smiled i like you a lot lexi i smiled and snuggled my head against his chest i like you even more no i like you more he grinned sorry but i like you way more nu uh yes huh nope yeppers nah yup no sorry yes definitely yes you re right no you re wrong wait i cried no that is not fair i always fall for that i whimpered i ll keep that in mind then george grinned i chuckled and looked at the clock on his wall oh we d better be getting to supper george i dontknow about you but my friends are very nosy i shook my head are you going to tell them he asked yeah i donthave to worry because the people whose opinions i care about will support me i reassured him although i dontthink draco would ever break down and call you george george grinned well that good because calling him malfoy has become quite the habit i laughed alright then what about you george shrugged fred probably already guessed that i liked you i ve mentioned you to him a bit i chuckled yeah and i accidentally knocked on his door when i first came george laughed then he probably got an extendable ear under the door right now we heard a small pop and saw a piece of pink material being pulled from under the door fred we both yelled sniggering could be heard through the wall i walked to dinner contemplating how i had just spent my day all in all it had been a very good one i sat down next to blaise and pansy noticing draco was absent hey guys i said settling myself down to eat lexi where have you been you missed the most outrageous scene in the common room today pansy squealed i raised an eyebrow certainly no scene in the common room would be worth missing how i had spent my day really what kind of scene i asked interested well blaise draco and i were coming in from the lake and damien was talking to theodore and a bunch of the guys and we heard him talking about pansy hesitated looking a bit flustered talking about i pressed pansy shifted in her seat well lexi he was saying some rather erhh vulgar things about you she said looking away vulgar as in i said horrified pansy said well you know she squirmed obviously embarrassed for me blaise broke in god lexi he said how much he d like to get you in the sack he even sounded uncomfortable saying it i shuddered and snapped not so loud but anyway pansy continued glad that the hard part was over draco heard him and got really mad and punched him in the face a few times and practically threw him across the room pansy paused then launched into her draco is such a sweetheart rant good i said coldly but i was really pleased that draco had done that i glanced at damien and noticed him sporting a black eye and various bruises creep i said hatefully disgusted that he would even think about me like that i saw him stand up and leave and nudged blaise come on i stood up blaise following pansy had just started telling us about draco wonderfully toned six pack honestly i dontthink he has a six pack i ll have to remember to check i hurried out of the great hall and yelled somers get you filthy disgusting arrogant ass over here i levitated him over to where blaise and i were standing you i shook with rage are such a gross little freak you pervert as if in you dreams no actually what you were suggesting is so far fetched that even in your dreams it would never happen so never ever say anything like that again or i will personally be responsible for ending your already slim chance of ever having children i hollered yikes what a crowd had formed but i was pleased to see most of the female population was supporting me the guys were just laughing at damien fate i lowered damien not gently mind you to the ground as he was standing up a small black shape leapt upon his head scratching and clawing with all of it might damien was yelping and hopping around trying to get the cat yes it was a cat off of his head looking closer that cat looked very familiar leila i said in amazement indeed it was as i said her name leila looked at me her greenish yellow eyes lit up mischievously damien took he distraction as a chance to fling her off of his head leila went sailing over heads as i gasped in horror she landed clumsily but got back to her feet gracefully i gaped at damien do you have any idea what could ve happened to her i hissed she was mutilating my face he cried in protest indeed his faces was covered with deep gashes from her claws i flipped my hair and held my head up high if you ask me i said icily it an improvement i walked away scooping leila up as i went blaise caught up with me as i headed towards the common room that is the smartest cat i ve ever met i said scratching leila head she purred yeah she great i looked down at the kitten in my arms leila sweetie are you okay did that big meanie hurt you i cooed blaise snorted big meanie i shrugged she doesntneed to hear bad language she just a kitten blaise rolled his eyes but didntrespond we walked into the common room and everyone gathered around to congratulate not me but my cat leila ran around receiving many pats on the head with her head and tail held high pah she is such an attention seeker i looked through the crowd and spotted draco i headed towards him then remembered he was still supposed to be getting a cold shoulder weeeelllll he did stand up for me and i certainly cantbe mad at him after he almost sent someone through the wall for me i walked up to draco and grinned hey he shrugged yeah i frowned oh dontbe like that geesh i trying to thank you for what he asked indifferently i rolled my eyes for defending my honor i said sweetly giving him a hug even when i was being a bitch to you oh like i wouldntkill anyone who talked badly about you draco smiled yeah well anyways you still deserved a thank you i grinned so where exactly were you while i was here defending your honor as you put it draco smile turned into a smirk not a lot of people know the difference between draco smiling and draco smirking when draco smirks his eye tend to squint a bit more and his mouth is more upturned when he smiles it more relaxed and his eyes arentsquinty i was around you now watching the gryffindor quidditch practice with cho i said pulling their plays out of my pocket here she gave me a copy for you draco grinned this is wonderful gryffindor ll come in dead last this year i chuckled that would be a sight that we would all be happy to see i paused well except for the gryffindors but hey who cares what they want aaaand since technically george wasnta gryffindor anymore i could bad mouth them all i wanted well drakey i gonna go to bed dontworry tomorrow i ll help you think of a way to fix the horrific damage my conversation with pansy has caused i smiled apologetically and wearily went off to bed the next morning i headed to breakfast alone being a sunday my friends aka draco blaise and pansy feel that it practically a law to sleep in until noon at least i planned on after breakfast hanging out with cho and maybe ginny i had noticed that while she had some friends and was quite popular with the boys she seemed to hover a lot around the dream team and okay maybe i wanted to tick her brother and his friends off but i did want to get to know her really i grinned at this thought and didntnotice an arm reaching out of a classroom doorway until i had been yanked inside what the heck i said angrily hoping it wasntdamien i really didntwant to get a detention for hexing someone today i looked at my captor and relaxed george grinned hey to you too hey i said warmly so i heard quite a few stories this morning about you damien somers and a cat george said really donttell me you re jealous that my kitten didntwant to scratch your eyes out i teased george grinned actually i was wondering more about what he said to make your cat want to scratch his eyes out i squirmed yeah that was gross it true then i nodded well then i just need to know one thing what i asked would you like him to die quickly or slowly george asked his face serious neither i said because then if you do something you ll get fired george grinned you wouldntwant me to get fired he came towards me well no i paused of course i wouldntwant you to leave why he asked slyly well i started nervously because then who would i have such uhm wonderful errr moments with and who would i george cut me off you want to know why i wouldntwant to leave i nodded dumbly because he said putting his arms around me if i werenthere i wouldntbe able to do this he pressed his lips on mine i grinned kissing him that was certainly something i would miss 15 minutes later i emerged from the empty classroom cursing myself for not being able to resist george while i straightened my clothing out as i headed towards my intended destination the great hall i pulled my hair out of the ponytail it had been in letting it fall down framing my face and covering the very noticeable very recognizable mark that was quickly appearing on my neck damn my lack of willpower end of chapter so guys i really do think this was much better than my first version so it a bit of a blessing in disguise that it got erased every cloud has a silver lining i guess and on a side note although there are 17 pages in this chapter there areabout 20 wordsmre than the original but either way i think quality counts more than quantity i like this version much better i want lots of reviews in fact i neeeeed them okay maybe i exaggertaing but they do make me very happy and make me feel like writing review please i ll be your bestest friend or if that scares you i wontbe your best friend whichever
