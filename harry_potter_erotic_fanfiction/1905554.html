 harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber summary post ootp harry deals with the loss of his godfather with some help from a certain red head hogwarts gets a new dada teacher who has more than a few secrets and all the while voldemort watches from the shadows awaiting the moment to strike a n i would just like to apologise for the pitiful quality of the first ten chapters or so it does get better really one day i going to re write all these chapters and hopefully take the cringe factor down slightly dawn stained the horizon with an angry glow as a boy with messy black hair sat at his window and watched it had become almost a ritual now to greet the sun every morning he wasntexactly sure why he did it or why he drew comfort from watching the glowing orb slide higher into the sky a dot appeared in the distance quickly resolving into the form of hedwig harry moved aside to allow the owl to swoop through the window coming to perch on the end of his bed he smiled sadly stroking the soft feathers on her head as she hooted softly nibbling at his fingers harry removed the letter attached to his owl leg seeing it was from ron and settled onto the bed to read harry mum just got word back from dumbledore sorry mate but he reckons it ll be safer for you to stay with the muggles for the rest of the summer should have seen mum she looked like she was going to yell at him when he said that anyway apparently we cantgo to grimmauld place either some of the old crowd had their houses attacked so they re staying with lupin there must be a lot of them because mum said there wasntenough room for us and it a big house sorry that my news is bad but maybe dumbledore will let you visit after all at least for your birthday write back soon ron harry closed his eyes tightly pinching the bridge of his nose then sighed and flopped back onto the bed another month and a half with the dursleys harry couldnthelp but feel a flash of resentment toward dumbledore then guilt as he remembered their conversation at the end of last year which resulted in the wholesale destruction of dumbledore office he resolutely stopped himself from thinking about the cause of that conversation the next week passed mostly without incident every other day since the start of the holidays harry had received a large food hamper from mrs weasley along with a note reminding him to eat well and telling him to write back if he needed more food he spent most of his time in his room brooding uncle vernon and aunt petunia who had evidently taken mad eye moody parting warning to heart were going out of their way to avoid him and that suited him right down to the ground he began taking long walks every evening hoping to exhaust himself before nightfall hoping to drive away the nightmares where he repeatedly saw sirius falling through the veil a part of him still refused to accept that his godfather was really dead but deep down he knew the truth and it constantly threatened to tear him apart sometimes he wanted to just start screaming and never stop but knew he couldn t the world was counting on him and every time he began to feel overwhelmed with sirius death he forced himself to imagine the first time he had walked into diagon alley there had been so many happy faces so many people just living their normal lives without fear that they could suddenly be attacked and killed as they did their shopping he couldntfail these unnamed faceless people their lives depended on him it was a lot of responsibility to shoulder but he grimly carried on he was sitting at his desk idly leafing through his charms textbook when pig rocketed through the open window colliding with harry shoulder with seeker reflexes he snatched the tiny owl from the air being careful not to hurt him as soon as harry removed the letter pig shot into the air again twittering madly and flying in circles around the room hedwig watched for a moment then resolutely turned her back harry opened the parchment to see a letter from ron with even messier handwriting than usual it looked like the letter was written in a hurry harry there was an attack at the burrow dumbledore moving everyone mum and dad are going to headquarters but we cantall go so the twins are going to stay with lee jordan i going to hermione s and ginny going to stay with you dad ll be there soon ron harry stared at the parchment for a few seconds in consternation words repeatedly flashed before his mind eye ginny going to stay with you he jumped from his chair and bolted downstairs hoping the dursleys wouldntexplode when he told them he found aunt petunia in the kitchen washing the dishes from lunch uncle vernon and dudley were out aunt petunia harry gasped out of breath what is it this time she snapped glaring at him there been an attack one of my friend houses harry said quickly she needs to stay here for a while aunt petunia stared at him incredulously for a moment she was about to say something when a large barn owl swept through the open kitchen window dropped a letter bearing the hogwart seal into her hands and left again petunia opened the letter gingerly as if she expected it to explode she read the contents of the letter and her eyes widened finally she sighed very well then petunia threw the letter into the trash she can stay so long as she understands the rules and doesntmention that abnormality while under this roof thanks harry raced back upstairs and was halfway through scribbling a note to ron when the front doorbell chimed harry raced back out of his room yelling i ll get it he opened the front door to find mr weasley and ginny both wearing muggle clothes ginny was crying into her father shoulder harry good to see you mr weasley said gravely giving ginny a small push in the back to start her moving she stumbled a little as she entered the house and harry reached out to steady her hi harry she said weakly finally looking up her eyes were red and puffy and her brilliant red hair was a mess suddenly she started sobbing again and harry drew her into a hug she clung to him her face pressed into his shoulder as she cried charlie was the only one home he in st mungo now but they dontknow if he ll make it mr weasley said in a low voice as they climbed the stairs made awkward because ginny wouldntlet go of harry he solved the problem by simply picking her up she tensed briefly then relaxed as he carried her up the stairs harry kicked his door open strode over to his bed and lay ginny down she curled up into a ball still shaking slightly mr weasley pulled a miniature trunk from his pocket and enlarged it setting it on the ground near harry own he looked around the room curiously but his eyes were strangely dead he pointed his wand at the bed and muttered a duplication charm and another bed appeared beside the original i have to go he said finally to harry all the order members are meeting at headquarters he sighed and passed one hand over his eyes looking older than harry had ever seen him he looked like he was going to speak but then sighed and disapparated with a sharp crack harry looked down at the girl sobbing on his bed unsure what he should do true he and ginny had become friends during last year but not to the same level as he ron and hermione he wasntentirely sure if she would welcome any attempt at comforting finally deciding to be brave he sat on the bed beside her ginny he said gently placing one hand on her shoulder ginny looked up at him biting her bottom lip i sorry she whispered without thinking he drew her into another hug she shook slightly in his arms and he patted her back awkwardly they sat there in silence for some time until the door was thrown open boy uncle vernon filled the doorway his face livid he pointed one beefy hand at ginny looking disdainfully at her slightly threadbare clothes she is not staying here he growled harry stood defiantly she has no where else to go he said in a deadly quiet voice silently amazed at himself for standing up to his uncle in this way her house was destroyed her brother is in st mungo s and her parents are fighting in a war the last few words were yelled so loud that vernon glanced at the window as if expecting to see someone there peering in listening to their conversation vernon face was alternating between dark red and a shade of purple finally he said what is this gibberish what gibberish was that harry asked coldly this st mangoes place st mungo hospital for magical maladies and injuries harry said shortly it a wizard hospital vernon face was by now the colour of a ripe beetroot do not mention your abnormality in this house he roared backhanding harry across the mouth hedwig hooted in indignation rattling the bars of her cage as harry crashed into the desk and sprawled on the floor something rolled from the desk and landed in his lap he looked down in a daze to see his wand leave him alone ginny said in a shaky voice she stood facing vernon bravely as his face turned even darker how dare you he screamed lifting his hand to hit her suddenly harry was on his feet wand in hand touch her and you will not live to see another day vernon dursley he said in a deadly voice vernon froze his hand ready to hit ginny as his eyes darted to the wand held rock steady in harry hand harry could almost see the wheels turning in his head you cantdo anything during the holidays vernon said finally lowering his hand wrong harry said still in that chilling quiet voice i can do anything and i will sure i ll go to azkaban but it would be worth it vernon looked from the wand to harry emerald eyes and apparently didntlike what he saw his eye twitched and then he turned and stormed from the room dontexpect us to feed her he yelled as he slammed the door i wasn t harry muttered to himself then turned to ginny who was watching him through eyes still red from crying thank you she said finally her eyes downcast that alright harry sighed passing a hand over his eyes in an unconscious duplication of mr weasley my uncle is a fat git my aunt isntquite so bad they stood there awkwardly for a moment before pig whom harry had completely forgotten about broke the tension by launching from his place atop harry cupboard and circling ginny head twittering madly ginny giggled a sad sound that made harry stomach do a strange sort of back flip hi pigwidgeon ginny said raising her hand with one finger outstretched the tiny owl came to rest on her finger still hooting in excitement he nibbled her finger before shooting into the air again unable to contain himself well harry said gloomily as he settled into the desk chair again welcome to my world ginny looked around and suddenly blushed realising they were expected to share the room harry he looked up is there somewhere i can you know change they both blushed furiously neither looking the other in the eye i didntget much sleep last night she finished lamely third door on the right he said quickly burying his face in a book to hide his embarrassment not noticing that he was holding said book upside down thank you ginny said her face now a similar colour to her hair as she drew some nightclothes from her trunk and dashed out of the room into the hall harry groaned and let his head hit the table with a solid thunk a n as always please review and tell me what you think if you couldntfigure it out

made a whole lot more sense with them in here but since is being so bloody anal i removed them if they still have a problem i ll quite happily tell them where they can stick it darkness silence slowly ginny eyes opened she knew immediately where she was hospital wing her head was throbbing painfully and her eyes hurt not from light because there was none but just pain the even sound of breathing came from one side of her bed and she tilted her head to get a better look harry was slumped in a chair his head lolling forwards and his hand still loosely gripping her own he here he with me suddenly the pain didntseem important anymore she settled back down a contented smile on her face and drifted off to sleep sunlight was streaming in through the windows when harry suddenly bolted upright his neck cracked alarmingly and his free hand rubbed it absently he hadntmeant to fall asleep but he had been exhausted after whatever he d done back in the village he could feel it there now like an awakened serpent a mass of power just beyond his reach but ready to strike on his command he didntknow what the hell it was and frankly he didntcare his thoughts dwelt on the girl in the bed before him it may have been his imagination but he was pretty sure she hadntbeen smiling in her sleep last night the next time ginny became aware of her surroundings bright light was making her eyes prickle even through her eyelids she squinted them tightly shut and heard movement next to the bed ginny harry voice seemed abnormally loud on her ears she tried to open her eyes but the sunlight was like twin daggers stabbing directly into her brain she squinted them shut again hurts she mumbled harry muttered something and the room was suddenly soothingly dark she opened her eyes and found that harry had sealed all the windows shut with a layer of stone harry she breathed mutely raising her arms slightly he sighed with relief leaning forwards and taking her into his arms there was a brilliant flash of light and before either knew what was happening they both blacked out when hermione and ron entered the hospital wing a few minutes later both had vanished once again harry found himself on the featureless white plane but this time voldemort was nowhere to be seen and harry wasntalone ginny stood at his side her eyes wide as she looked around in confusion sirius stood slightly off to one side a dark look on his face only james looked at ease with their predicament his arms were folded as if he were waiting for something harry ginny asked nervously where are we the dream plane a voice answered harry looked up to see a man striding towards them across the emptiness he wore long archaic robes of a deep scarlet his sweeping chestnut beard was longer than dumbledore s and a very familiar sword was belted at his waist godric gryffindor at your service the man bowed grandly as he reached them sweeping one hand out in front of him harry and ginny could only stare in dumb disbelief i was wondering how long it would take james commented gryffindor smiled knowingly you always were too clever for your own good james or should i say joseph it james in this particular time and place james said firmly gryffindor shrugged as you wish what are you doing here gryffindor sirius growled this isntwhat we agreed on sometimes even the best plans change gryffindor sighed it has become necessary that we tell them now so that they can take full advantage of the opportunities being presented to them excuse me ginny said politely tell us what harry could tell from her voice that she thought she was going insane gryffindor looked at her penetratingly she is fit he said finally she has beauty beyond our expectations but also a hint of steel she will be perfect ginny blushed at his words her eyes lowering and mister potter gryffindor turned to harry who was still staring at the scarlet robed man in disbelief he couldntquite persuade himself that what he was seeing was real i quite real harry at least on this particular plane he smiled indulgently i believe you are more than ready to accept full responsibility for who and what you are are you sure sirius started but harry cut him off who am i then and where voldemort he demanded gryffindor chuckled lightly the dark lord is not the only one who can create a dream he said then stepped forward and placed one hand on harry shoulder and raised his free hand placing the palm against harry forehead as to who you are you are my heir he said simply and blue light engulfed his hand flowing into harry head several things clicked into place in harry mind and quite suddenly he knew it was as if a door had suddenly opened in his mind a door that led to unimaginable power that had always been sealed tight his eyes wide and his breath coming in sharp bursts he felt power beyond his wildest dreams coursing through his veins and his mind shied back from the immensity of it harry ginny took his hand seeing the almost frightened look on harry face harry closed his eyes and suddenly the hair on the back of ginny neck stood on end as a massive wave of power radiated out from raven haired boy suddenly it wasntan empty whiteness anymore they stood in the middle of an immense forest surrounded by massive trees fully a thousand feet tall flowers the size of cars bloomed nearer the ground and brightly coloured birds flitted through the lower branches their calls filling the forest with noise the whole scene just reeked of life and gryffindor looked at harry proudly you see my son he beamed throwing his arms into the air you see what you will be capable of harry was staring at his outstretched hands in disbelief how he whispered gryffindor face grew guarded now that i cannot tell you he said regretfully you must learn this on your own i dontthink you d want to know anyway sirius said bitterly gryffindor caught harry eyes a thousand years ago on the thirty first of july a prophecy was made it spoke of a boy who would defeat a great evil that would engulf the land it was very specific in how we would recognise this boy and who would help him on his quest it mentioned a guide a mentor and a huntress amongst others a prophecy about a prophecy harry asked a little incredulously more like a set of instructions gryffindor corrected a map to help the one who would come to stop the great evil which quite obviously is you harry who made the prophecy ginny demanded i did gryffindor said simply we have identified these three main helpers and we felt it time for you to know who gryffindor smiled your godfather sirius black is the guide sirius snorted and i doing a bang up job too he said bitterly mr james milton is the mentor speaking james said with a faint smile and miss ginevra weasley is the huntress me ginny eyes went very wide yes you gryffindor said with a smile i have every confidence in your abilities miss weasley i am sure you will complete your appointed tasks perfectly what tasks ginny demanded her eyes afire with curiosity gryffindor smiled faintly in a way so like james that harry almost laughed that would be telling he said with a twinkle in his eye that was very reminiscent of dumbledore now he continued if you ll all excuse me i d like a word with my heir james and sirius wavered and vanished ginny wavered but harry concentrated briefly and she solidified again gryffindor raised one eyebrow anything i know she knows too harry said firmly his arm going around her shoulder she smiled gratefully at him as you wish gryffindor nodded he raised one hand and one of the car sized flowers transmuted into two comfy looking lounges will you sit he motioned to the lounges taking a seat himself after removing his sword belt and laying it aside harry and ginny sat on the other i imagine this is all coming as a bit of a shock harry gryffindor said gently you could say that yeah harry head was still spinning wildly trying to sort everything out he wasntmaking much progress gryffindor sighed clasping his hands together i sorry to just dump all this on you at once but you have to believe it is necessary i believe it is better for you to know now so you can begin to make preparations for later yeah harry said thinking back to his explosion in dumbledore office at the end of last year yeah it is better to know gryffindor staring piercingly at him this isntgoing to be easy harry he warned here on the dream plane your powers are easy to control in the real world it doesntwork like that the powers that be have agreed to amplify your abilities in accordance with the prophecy but the human mind cannot handle power of the kind i talking about perhaps some will manifest under your direct control but most will stay separate from you almost as a separate entity altogether it will obey your wishes but it will read your wishes from your emotions you will have to learn self control harry otherwise you could seriously hurt someone harry nodded slowly i understand he said hollowly gryffindor smiled faintly i believe you do you have felt it already haventyou harry nodded again in the village when ginny was in trouble i wanted voldemort gone and he just kind of went gryffindor smiled at ginny already your task has begun he said cryptically then spoke to harry this is what i mean if you had wished harm on a student instead of wellbeing the student would be in trouble do you understand i think so harry said wryly it may take a few days to sink in gryffindor laughed heartily fair enough he said his eyes twinkling again now i believe it is time for you both to return to hogwarts one more thing harry said suddenly why does my power feel like a snake gryffindor looked startled then closed his eyes briefly ah he said finally opening them again do you remember the basilisk you slew in the chamber of secrets harry felt ginny tense beside him yes i remember he said shortly it appears to have been impressed with you gryffindor said his smile back apparently it volunteered to become your familiar spirit my what it was harry turn to be startled it has become the repository for all your extra power gryffindor explained it is the basilisk who wields that power for your benefit and that is why the power feels snake like because it is suddenly harry felt something thump him in the chest he almost leapt out of his seat scrabbling in his robes for whatever it was and pulled out the amulet ginny had given him for his birthday only now it had changed before the amulet had depicted the sword of gryffindor point down with a crown around the hilt and a snake biting it own tail surrounding the whole thing now entwined with the sword was another serpent this one depicting a basilisk complete with emerald eyes now is the true form of the talisman revealed gryffindor said softly he smiled apologetically at ginny i sorry i had to use you to create it miss weasley but that how these things work mr gryffindor umm sir ginny started hesitantly i know what you are going to ask he said kindly and the answer is no he cannot ginny breathed a huge sigh of relief and harry looked puzzled let me explain something gryffindor went on voldemort has no concept of what love is lust yes but love no it can be one of his greatest weaknesses if you can find a way to exploit it keep in mind that most of his followers follow out of fear alone they hold no love for him he looked piercingly at harry that is where you are very very different harry your people follow you out of love what you and miss weasley feel is entirely of your own making voldemort had no part in it he smiled at them as the forest dissolved and harry closed his eyes keeping a tight grip on ginny when he opened them again they were in the forbidden forest some distance from the castle harry was lying on his back on the loam and ginny was on top of him how did we get here ginny asked her arms still tightly around harry neck no idea harry breathed his face inches from hers i dontknow about you but i not one to waste a happy opportunity he smiled up at her and closed the distance to her lips from far back in the trees there came the thudding of many hooves harry and ginny sprang apart and scrambled to their feet each going for their wand suddenly the trees seemed to erupt as fully fifty centaurs charged towards them pulling up sharply a few feet away bane was leading the group and he stepped forward now to face harry you are trespassing in our woods he said flatly ignoring the two wands trained on him they re not your woods ginny shot back they re on hogwarts grounds so they re actually our woods she pointed to the hogwarts crest on her uniform bane eyes went wide with rage impudent human he roared and two centaurs grabbed ginny from behind she dropped her wand trying in vain to kick at the centaurs touch one hair on her head and you will regret it harry said in a deadly voice and within him he felt the sleeping serpent stir suddenly the centaurs released ginny shaking their hands as if burned and glaring at harry you dare use magic on us human one snarled as ginny grabbed her wand and hurried to harry side who ignored the centaur and sent ginny a look of concern she smiled back although it was slightly strained move please harry said in the same quiet voice to bane who shifted slightly before his nostrils flared i am not a common mule to be used by a human he flared take them kill the girl first as several centaurs moved forward their bows at the ready harry felt a rage within him that flared brightly forcing the serpent to react bane was suddenly knocked off his feet sent flying into a tree some ten feet away the centaurs that had been about to grab ginny again suffered a similar fate there was a collective roar of rage from the gathered centaurs and as one they charged forward only to slam into an invisible wall and fall backward three feet from where harry and ginny stood by now bane was back on his feet watching the two with a mix of awe and fear you are the one he whispered he is the one he has the mark of the serpent he cried and all movement stopped touch him not bane commanded then suddenly shocked both teens by bowing to harry you are free to pass through the forest at any time master he said wonderingly and one by one the rest of the centaurs joined him in his bow harry stared at them bewildered as they rose and melted back into the trees he turned to look at ginny who was blinking rapidly as if she couldntbelieve what had just happened what the hell was that all about she demanded the one what i have no idea harry said honestly i think it time to speak to my mentor a n cripes longest one yet finally found a way around the superman syndrome dontgive harry control over his powers muahahahahaha lots of weirdness and fun stuff imminent thanks again to firefly anyone who doesntlike this chapter blame her ducks into fallout shelter as the much discused chainsaw comes flying at his head ack harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n to all those who wanted to know a little more about james past read on it finally took the combined effort of professors dumbledore mcgonagall and flitwick to stop the notes from attacking malfoy the slytherin was looking a little wild around the eyes as mcgonagall led him from the hall and his face was slashed to pieces with paper cuts harry stood next to ginny her hand firmly gripped in his own grinning from ear to ear nearby ron and hermione stood in a half embrace her head resting on his shoulder i call them post it notes a voice said from very close behind them harry turned his head to find a smirking alex with cassie just behind him you just send them to someone by owl post and as soon as they read the note the charm activates genius ginny smiled at him nodding almost imperceptibly to acknowledge that she knew they had done it to cheer harry up worthy of gred and forge that one harry grinned holding out his free hand mock gravely alex shook it there you are isabelle approached carrying a tray holding butterbeers she handed them out to each person absently vanishing the tray when she had finished a toast ron announced holding his bottle high to great pranks to a brilliant piece of magic hermione added raising her own bottle to the new troublemakers in chief isabelle grinned to the pair who could give my brothers a run for their money ginny smiled adding her bottle to great friends harry added quietly alex and cassie raised their bottles and everyone clinked the twins touched by harry addition it was strange really they had only been at hogwarts for two months and yet it seemed like an eternity they were now truly a part of the group well this is all well and good cassie broke the silence that had descended over them but this is one of my favourite songs and i going to find seamus she smirked at her brother and walked off she has a point alex admitted throwing the now empty bottle over his shoulder where it vanished before it could hit the floor he extended his hand to isabelle who took it with a smile and led her onto the dance floor you know that an awfully good idea harry commented to ginny she allowed him to lead her back onto the dance floor a smile playing about her lips james watched the group toast still under the cover of his invisibility spell he noticed ron and hermione shoot each other a significant look and stealthily head for the exit james chuckled quietly teenagers were all the same his mind was still dwelling on the photo he had seen in harry dorm and what it meant he had known for some time that his children would be involved rather heavily in the prophecy but the fact that harry knew as well was a little disturbing it meant that he was coming more into his true power and they werentready for that yet it was far far too early james sighed heavily taking a seat in an unobtrusive corner where no one was likely to try to sit on him he watched harry once more dancing with ginny watched him pull her closer as they danced to a slow song that too was a part of the prophecy he could no more stop those two getting together than stop the tides but again it was happening too fast they had expected to have at least another year to prepare james sighed again this time in frustration why was everything happening so damn quickly he thought back briefly to the incident earlier with that corner boy that had been a really really stupid thing to do on michael part james doubted that even malfoy would have the gumption to try anything with ginny it was downright dangerous what with how protective harry could be of her harry had been on the verge of throwing the moron through the wall he could tell there had been a tightening around the eyes that while a normal person would miss a trained mind mage could see easily but harry had controlled his anger had exerted influence over that damnable basilisk he was getting better no doubts there but would it be enough not for the first time he thought back nine months to the previous christmas when a man calling himself peter pettigrew had approached him back in australia about a job working for some dark lord james knew exactly what the offer meant and he also knew what it would mean to turn it down he had no interest in joining the wizard who thought he could fill grindelwald shoes he d had his chance and had failed joseph milter was long dead now he was james milton father of alexander and cassandra as it always did that train of thought brought up the persuasion technique voldemort had used in a last ditch effort to gain his allegiance james face twisted into a grimace as he remembered coming home on christmas eve after a long day to find an odd skull like symbol hovering above his house he had hurried inside and had found james pulled himself up sharply there is no point dwelling on the past he told himself sternly you are here now and you can make a difference now stop worrying even so he found it very hard to shake the image of a pair of very beautiful but very vacant blue eyes harry harry parted reluctantly from ginny to find neville standing nearby fidgeting nervously just behind him stood luna what is it neville he asked wondering what could make the round faced boy so nervous could i that is would you let me i mean neville stammered his face going very red his eyes darted to ginny and suddenly harry understood he was too nervous to ask ginny to dance what do you think ginny he asked casually reckon you could dance with neville for a bit i ll dance with luna of course ginny said warmly taking neville hand he gulped glancing at harry before allowing ginny to lead him away guess that just leaves us harry said to luna extending his hand luna smiled and took it they danced in silence for a while until luna spoke haventseen you very much lately she said no not really harry agreed i ve been spending most of my time with neville she informed him i think he going to ask me out soon that good then harry said a little uncertainly thrown off balance by luna frank manner yes it is she said dreamily glancing at where neville and ginny were dancing he liked her for ages she said suddenly yeah i know harry wasntsure what to make of that i think he over her now though luna added and as harry watched neville laughed easily at something ginny said suddenly it clicked what neville had been afraid of he hadntbeen nervous about asking ginny to dance he was afraid of me wasnthe harry asked a heavy weight settling in his stomach luna looked surprised of course she said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world what did you think harry didntanswer finally the dance ended and ginny and neville came back the former smiling wickedly and the later blushing brightly neville glanced at harry but quickly lowered his eyes and mumbled an apology neville harry said firmly and the boy raised his head slowly you re my friend i would never hurt you unless you gave me a very good reason to you donthave to be afraid neville swallowed hard nodding slightly sorry harry said softly placing one hand on neville shoulder their eyes caught and neville nodded firmly good man harry released his hold on neville shoulder turned and led ginny away attention students harry looked away from ginny reluctantly to see professor dumbledore standing at the front of the stage his arms held up high and a smile on his face in just a moment we will be voting for the best dressed couple award would all students wanting to enter please come up to the front of the room now harry and ginny parted and made their way off the dance floor and back to their seats harry spotted alex and isabelle moving towards dumbledore and pointed them out to ginny doesntreally surprise me love she said quietly harry started slightly at the last word his heart beating faster what ginny asked curiously catching the strange look on his face nothing harry assured her quickly a warmth that had nothing to do with temperature spread through him and he leaned back in his seat contentedly wrapping his arm around ginny and pulling her closer is that everyone dumbledore asked scanning the hall quickly all right then i ll ask each couple to come up on stage and you can cast your votes a wand lit red is no and green is yes everyone ready there was a murmur of consent then let us begin as the first couple came on stage harry glanced at ginny do you really want to watch this not really ginny said turning her head so she could see him what do you have in mind harry smile was playful and gave her all the information she needed what a brilliant idea she breathed reaching up and kissing him briefly they stood and hand in hand left the hall as quickly and unobtrusively as possible james watched harry and ginny slip out of the hall a pained grimace on his face he was happy for them truly he was but at the same time he couldnthelp but be jealous of them for what they were in the process of discovering and he had already lost brooding again dad cassie took a seat beside him james smiled wryly and dropped the invisibility spell i starting to regret showing you two how to do that he shook his head then looked at her curiously shouldntyou be with your date cassie shrugged seamus is dancing with lavender i reckon she better for him anyway oh they lapsed into silence cassie leaned over to rest her head on her father shoulder his hand almost automatically began to stroke her hair i ve missed this cassie said in a small voice missed what james asked you dad she sat up straight again we hardly ever see you since we came to hogwarts you re always busy doing something else james sighed heavily i know and i sorry but this is a war cass you know that we all have to make sacrifices i know she said pensively i dontthink alex even notices but he has isabelle now yes i suppose that would make a difference james wrapped a comforting arm around his daughter shoulders i dontunderstand cassie said quietly snuggling closer into james side sometimes he acts like nothing changed and sometimes he completely different i dontknow what to do have you tried talking to him james suggested gently yeah but he just keeps avoiding it she sighed again he wonttalk to me about anything important anymore it just pranks and joking he not handling it very well most wouldn t james said dryly this is serious dad cassie said impatiently i think he needs help all right james agreed i ll see if i can find someone to talk with him thanks dad cassie kissed him on the cheek stood and was gone james dropped his head into his hands letting out a sigh if for no other reason he would make sure voldemort died for the damage he had done to the twins no one not even malfoy should be forced to watch their mother raped tortured and killed before them oh yes the dark lord would pay dearly a n hope this chapter

we never kicked british arse per se but we could if we had to i suppose we donthave the numbers but we have one of the better equipped and trained armies in the world just look at the casualty lists

news this chapter i have a beta woot many many thanks to creative quill hopefully she can plug all the bigger plot holes that keep cropping up you lot might not notice them but i do and wince if you haventread her fics yet why the bloody hell are you wasting time on my crap go read them now that evening when harry had made his goodnights in the common room and was heading for his dorm ginny shocked everyone by following him what are you doing harry hissed at her as she closed the door behind her following you she said calmly oi what are you doing up here dean demanded poking his head out through the curtains on his bed it quite simple she said in that same calm tone as seamus and neville heads also appeared my presence wards off voldemort and dumbledore wontlet us have a private room since that leaves either my dorm the common room or here and harry cantget into my dorm that means i ll have to sleep in here from now on harry ron dean and seamus were all gaping at her like she had three heads i dontmind neville broke the silence once again coming to harry support if it helps harry then i dontcare if she stays here yeah but dean spluttered there are hangings on the beds ginny pointed out you wonteven know i here you know i pretty sure this is against school rules alex said in an amused tone as he entered the dorm since when do you care about rules ginny retorted alex raised his hands in surrender hey i not arguing against it or anything he said placatingly just thought i d point it out is all if you re going to do this though you d best make sure mcgonagall doesntfind out she ll have you back in your own dorm faster than you can say holy hell what was that ginny harry spoke up it too dangerous what if i staying harry whether you like it or not she said in a steely tone i not having you suffering just because of some stupid school rule we are going to get into so much trouble harry said resignedly as ginny disappeared behind the hangings on his bed you wonttell anyone will you guys dean and seamus exchanged a long glance and finally dean sighed nah mate we wonttell anyone i just hope ginny dorm mates dontsay anything they won t ginny voice came from behind the curtains dean and seamus heads vanished back within the confines of their own beds dont even bother asking alex said flatly as harry gaze turned to him if you really think i d betray a friend like that you dontknow me very well finally harry gaze came to rest on the only person in the room yet to speak ron gaze was alternating between harry bed and harry himself and conflicting emotions flickered across his face finally he sighed heavily and gave harry a wan smile go on then he said in a resigned tone of voice i not going to tell anyone good came ginny voice again now come to bed harry harry turned beet red as alex grinned at him muted snickers could be heard from the direction of seamus bed this could be interesting harry muttered to himself as he climbed through the hangings on his own bed his face burned even more when he saw ginny having shed her school robes now clad only in an old too short nightdress scratching padfoot ears silenco harry flicked his wand at the hangings that wasntreally necessary you know ginny smiled at him it not like we ll be doing anything wrong it makes me feel a lot more comfortable he muttered as she slipped beneath the covers stop being such a prude and get over here she pointed at the bed beside her yes ma am he said obediently slipping into the bed beside her there now ginny giggled lightly that wasntso hard now was it she leaned over and kissed him goodnight harry i ll see you in the morning she snuggled up against him and within minutes was sleeping contentedly harry lay awake for a long time feeling very unequipped to deal with the unfamiliar sensation of ginny pressed against him in bed it was very different to the few times they d slept together on a couch in the common room this was in his bed although he knew nothing untoward was happening he shuddered to think what mcgonagall would say if she ever found out he knew ginny well enough by now however to know she wouldnttake no for an answer he only hoped it didntland them in massive trouble in the early hours of the morning he finally gave up contenting himself to lay there with ginny in his arms and sleep eventually claimed him haaarry haaarry harry mumbled something incoherent and turned over in bed barely registering the quiet words in his ear he heard voices holding a whispered conversation but really didntcare what they were saying it was saturday his bed was nice and warm and he had nowhere to be he fully intended to sleep for at least another few hours his plans were cut violently short when a pitcher of ice cold water was dumped over his head harry sat bolt upright in bed his wand clenched tightly in his hand only to see ginny alex and cassie rolling on the floor tears of mirth streaming down their faces from the amount of light coming in through the window it was already mid morning a quick glance around the room told him that dean seamus and neville had already left he panicked for a brief moment that they had gone to tell mcgonagall about the new sleeping arrangements but shook the thought off very funny harry grumbled shaking his head in a vain attempt to dislodge some of the water in his hair from the end of his bed padfoot watched him with his tongue lolling out in canine laughter sorry harry ginny gasped for breath trying hard not to break out into a fresh bout of laughter but it was the quickest way we could think of to wake you what so bloody important harry tried to glare at the trio ginny put on her most angelic expression while alex and cassie wore identical looks of pure innocence and he eventually gave up we figured everyone could use some cheering up alex grinned at him and i reckon the marauders are just the one to do it dontyou couldnt it wait for a few hours harry cast a quick drying charm on his soaked clothes mentally thanking hermione for teaching it to him then turned his wand on his bed no alex and cassie said together these two have some master plan that they want to implement at lunch ginny explained they haventtold me what it is yet she added shooting the twins a resentful look hey now wouldntwant to spoil the surprise now would we alex grinned at her absolutely not cassie confirmed trust me you wontbe disappointed alright harry said resigned to the fact he wasntgoing to get any more sleep what do we need to do by the time the four sat down to eat lunch they were all trying very hard not to burst out laughing ron looked up suspiciously from where he was sitting with hermione as they took their seats where have you lot been all day he demanded oh nowhere of any great importance alex said with an airy wave of his hand translation what you dontknow canthurt you cassie said with a chuckle you can hope anyway ginny added ron just stared at them in bafflement what the hell is that supposed to mean oh ron hermione said in exasperation what does it matter they re just trying to confuse you trying alex said with one eyebrow raised i thought we were succeeding myself i cantimagine where i got that impression ron retort was cut off abruptly when dumbledore stood from his place at the head table and the great hall fell silent it pleases me to announce that in the interests of training for a repeat of the attack on hogwarts a few weeks ago we will be holding a duelling tournament in the week before the holidays the hall broke out into excited whispers and dumbledore waited patiently for it to quiet again this tournament will be open only to those students fifth year and above and there is a limit of ten students per house for a total of forty students competing the winner will receive one hundred house points and the right to test their skills against a duelling master at this the whispers broke out again ten fold dumbledore waited patiently for quiet to return a slight smile on his face indeed this is something to be excited about all students who would like to enter themselves into the tournament will find a sign up sheet in the entrance hall the first matches will take place a week from monday and the sign up sheet will remain until saturday afternoon when the first round of matches will be drawn so make sure you have your entries in before then dumbledore clapped his hands sharply signalling the beginning of the meal and re seated himself and promptly changed into a goat harry ginny alex and cassie collapsed into the couches in front of the fire in the deserted gryffindor tower all four howling with laughter did you see the look on mcgonagall face before she changed cassie managed to get out between fits of laughter absolutely priceless i liked hagrid myself alex grinned i dontthink i ve ever seen a bear quite that big before or one wearing a moleskin coat for that matter what about flitwick ginny giggled i thought he made a darling little rabbit not as good as your dad harry said grinning back at alex he going to be so pissed at us alex chuckled still it was worth it and what about snape cassie smirked very appropriate ginny smirked back he already looks like a bat most of the time wasntmuch change really the fat lady suddenly burst open and students began to pour into the common room nice work seamus grinned at the four as he passed what makes you think it was us alex asked innocently sure like we d believe it was anyone else dean snorted as he passed then flashed a quick smile still it was a great prank i ll give you that you might want to steer clear of snape for a while though he looked absolutely livid when he changed back thanks for the warning cassie smiled as he and seamus disappeared up the stairs to the dorms neville caught harry eyes and grinned giving him a thumbs up harry returned the gesture with a smile it seemed the prank had done its job the common room was alive with excited chatter in a way that it hadntbeen for quite some time it was good to see that everything had returned to normal for a while at least harry wasntna ve enough to believe it would last but a brief respite was better than nothing at all harry what wrong harry looked up to find ginny face inches from his own all traces of laughter gone from her eyes as she gazed at him from the corner of his eyes harry noticed alex and cassie making themselves scarce giving the couple some privacy nothing i guess harry sighed as ginny sat next to him leaning her head on his shoulder this reminds me so much of last year when fred and george would pull off their latest prank i glad we could make everyone forget for a few days but i know it wontlast very long well there nothing we can do about it ginny said softly craning her neck so she could look up at him it not your fault voldemort is out there killing people and at the moment there nothing you can do to stop him you know that so stop beating yourself up over it harry winced deep down she d hit the nail on the head he did feel like it was his fault even though he knew it wasn t and he felt guilty for staying within the safety of hogwarts when he should be out fighting voldemort and his death eaters how do you do that read me so well i mean ginny turned an interesting shade of crimson as his question well i spent years watching you when you never noticed me and i got to know you quite well she bit her lip actually i have a confession to make after my first year and the chamber i used to follow you around between classes really harry asked surprised yeah ginny giggled actually i nicked your timetable and made a copy of it so i d always know where you d be and i d follow you to your next class i did that right through my second and third years how did i never see you then ginny laughed a little painfully if you had would you have noticed harry felt the sudden urge to curse himself all that time he could have spent with her and he d wasted it all by being too thick to see what was right there in front of him for the hundredth time he asked himself how the hell he d managed to overlook her for so long i sorry gin he said quietly i must be blind to have missed you for so long ginny smiled up at him dontbe sorry i know you have a habit of overlooking things that are right under your nose she laughed at harry mock outraged expression i just want to enjoy our time together now that we have some she finished snuggling closer to him almost of it own volition harry arm went around her and they stayed that way for quite some time even when a wryly amused professor milton entered the common room and for the third time in four months the twins ended up with electric pink hair review responses silver warrior you know i hadntthought of that thanks for pointing it out evansk someone hasntbeen paying attention andrea was a muggle mate athena dumbledore cassie isntwith anyone for a very specific reason tonks and james you ll just have to wait and find out wontyou dree that is indeed a compliment my friend siriusfanatic i think you need a name change fudgefanatic gpotter hmm a sequel to colours of the forest could be cool or you could try a new fic i suppose it up to you either way if you send it to anyone else to beta i ll be extremely offended msmissprongs i sowwy find me a corner whimsical firefly soon enough miss patience jwhit moony actually when my muses are involved it usually equals 3 967 or so it kinda cool writing in correlation with wf i just have to make sure the events match up between the two stories kirbychirby from the amount of comments similar to yours i get the feeling i going to have to hide from hoards of rampaging reviewers wielding pitchforks in the not too distant future dark phoenixx1988 i dont think i want to know gigifanfic oh yes we still have a long way to go at this rate we ll have another ootp on our hands sunni07 you could probably get one pretty cheap if you re really keen on living under someone just as bad shakes fist in johnny howard direction siriusblack08 i thought you might like that one as you probably gathered action aplenty soon enough i cantwait to do a harry draco duel shotgunn james doesnt really stand anywhere right now he has a vendetta against ol voldemort so he working with dumbledore in the last war he worked for both sides read sirius choice by whimsical firefly if you want more of an insight into james personality it shows him during the first war besides it a good story cynthia good grief that a lot of reviews i cantanswer all the points you raised or we ll be here all night thanks for the comments though you reminded me of a few things i d been meaning to put in but had forgotten cheers harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n ahh where would i be these days without my wonderful beta many many thanks once again to cq that evening after dinner when most of gryffindor house were in the common room either doing homework chatting with friends or playing assorted games the portrait hole opened and professor mcgonagall entered the common room harry looked up from his place with ginny ron and hermione beside the fire as conversation ceased and all eyes turned expectantly towards their head of house i ll assume all of you were present at lunch today to receive the headmaster news she said shortly there was a rumble of assent from the assembled students good then you all know that only ten students from each house can enter this contest and since there are thirty potential candidates i here to ensure there will be no arguments over who gets to compete and who doesn t those chosen will be representing not only themselves but also gryffindor so i certainly hope you will conduct yourselves in a matter according to your station now she continued sweeping the silent room with a stern glance i suppose the pertinent question is who would like to compete across the room from harry his pink hair standing out vibrantly against the cold stone walls alex hand immediately shot up it was followed shortly by isabelle s who grinned impishly at her boyfriend when he raised an eyebrow at her very well that two then mcgonagall nodded her approval anyone else her gaze swept the room again seeming to linger on harry he almost groaned aloud of course she would expect him to compete it wasntthat he didnt want to in fact he was rather looking forward to it and he knew what he was currently feeling was more than a little childish it was more that he hated the fact that everyone just assumed that he would enter being the great harry potter and all he glanced at ginny sitting beside him and saw her eyes were narrowed at the professor she d clearly caught the look as well and just as clearly wasntvery happy about it i ll give it a go ron said raising his arm harry glad for the lead also raised his followed by ginny and hermione excellent mcgonagall said clearly pleased so we have potter two weasleys granger lestrange and milton anyone else harry didntmiss his jump to the front of the queue but forced his expression to remain neutral ginny grasped his hand and squeezed tightly well aware of how much he hated preferential treatment a seventh year named michael wilde raised his hand followed by a fifth year named aaron davis that eight mcgonagall gaze swept the room once more anyone else what the hell greg redfield shrugged from his place next to aaron i ll give it a go he raised his hand a seventh year girl harry didntknow the name of looked at him speculatively then raised her hand as well very well that ten mcgonagall nodded curtly potter weasley weasley granger lestrange milton wilde redfield davis richmond i expect you all to have your names down tomorrow that is all with that she turned and left as abruptly as she had entered well that was different ginny remarked as the noise level rose again she obviously just didntwant anyone arguing over those positions hermione stated reopening the book she had been reading when mcgonagall had first entered at least now we know who going to be competing well i dontknow about you lot but i really looking forward to flattening malfoy ron grinned viciously ron hermione scolded this isntabout your personal vendetta against malfoy this is about training us for the real possibility that we may have to face death eaters again nah ron dismissed her words that what we ve got harry for right mate he turned to gain harry support only to find both he and ginny missing harry who had sensed the argument brewing and quickly made his escape was currently sitting on his bed with ginny he was scowling into the middle distance and ginny was watching him intently it not bloody fair he finally said bitterly i know it not ginny said softly rubbing his back soothingly she had no right to do that it not just her harry corrected everyone in the room just assumed i d enter i could tell well you do have a habit of being involved with these things ginny said carefully she didntparticularly want to revive his memories of the triwizard tournament yeah i know harry sighed the great harry potter always in the thick of things well just once i d like to be on the outside watching someone else get screwed over maybe then they d know what it feels like you dontmean that and you know it ginny wrapped her arms around him from behind there no way you d ever let someone else suffer you d do everything you could to take the burden from them i know you harry james potter harry said nothing there was really nothing to say because deep down he knew she was right hermione had been right last year he did have a saving people thing and that was exactly what had got sirius killed ginny feeling harry tense up mentally kicked herself well done now you ve made it worse she scolded herself harry listen to me it alright gin he said in a strained voice i harry just shut up for a minute and stop feeling sorry for yourself ginny snapped although her hold on him tightened to lessen the harshness of the words you are the bravest most self sacrificing person at hogwarts maybe even in all of britain and that is exactly what is going to defeat voldemort when you went to the department of mysteries last year did you even once think about your own safety no you spent the entire time trying to convince the rest of us not to come along with you because it was too risky you did exactly what you thought was necessary when you thought it was necessary to do it it not your fault that voldemort tricked you it not your fault sirius died and personally i find your absolute concern for others over your own preservation one of your more appealing qualities harry had half turned within the circle of her arms and was now staring at her dumbfounded by her words several times he opened his mouth to speak but the words died before he could verbalise them look harry she said in a much gentler tone i know it unfair and i know you hate the attention but there nothing you can do about it would you really trust anyone else to get the job done harry considered a moment then his shoulders slumped and he leaned against her no i suppose not he said resignedly wrapping his own arms around her waist it just he trailed off a lump forming in his throat i know she said softly and felt his grip tighten so he was almost clinging to her just remember you re not alone i here hermione here and i certainly cantsee ron abandoning you any time soon she couldntsee his smile because it was currently buried in her shoulder but she knew it was there and i sure you can rely on isabelle and the twins as well she continued not to mention the rest of my family harry remembered what charlie had said only a few days ago about him being a part of the family and his smile widened yeah i know he said his voice only slightly muffled by the fabric of her robes he pulled away from her slightly just enough so he could look into her eyes thank you he said sincerely i have no idea what i did to deserve ginny cut off his sentence with a lingering kiss dontbe ridiculous she breathed when they finally parted you re you that more than enough for me harry had no idea what to say to her heartfelt statement so settled for kissing her again they were still locked together when the dormitory door banged open and ron stormed in muttering under his breath get a room you two he half snapped at harry and ginny who had broken apart at his entrance is that an order brother dear ginny asked sweetly ron gaped at her for a moment until her realised exactly what he d said then scowled at her he turned abruptly jumped onto his own bed and ripped the hangings shut wow that must have been a bad one ginny said after harry had drawn his own hangings and silenced them yeah he said distractedly i ve not seen them so bad for ages i wonder what sparked this off you have to talk to ron ginny said seriously find out what going on with him i ll do the same with hermione are you sure it wouldntbe better to just let them sort it out themselves harry asked not eager to get into the middle of yet another ron hermione argument possibly ginny conceded but i get the feeling there more to this one like you said they haventargued like this for ages and ron certainly hasntstormed off like he obviously did tonight he usually far more interested in the making up part yeah you might be right harry nodded i ll talk to him tomorrow the following morning the ten selected gryffindors made their way down to the entrance hall as a group a wordless show of solidarity when they arrived they found a group of hufflepuffs already there taking turns to enter their names into the book it appeared that professor sprout had taken the same no nonsense approach as mcgonagall after the hufflepuffs had moved on harry led the gryffindors over to the entry book set into a niche in the wall the book itself could more aptly be described as a tome fully two feet tall with covers bound in scarlet leather an almost identical colour to that of the hogwarts express harry realised taking a quill from a conveniently placed inkwell harry wrote his name at the top of a new page followed by his house one by one the other gryffindors followed suit in an almost solemn procession moving to the side and reforming into a group once they had finished i should have known a sneering voice came from the entrance to the dungeons just as greg redfield finished entering his name you just have to be the hero dontyou potter couldntbear the thought of actually letting anyone else have a go for a change harry pointedly ignored malfoy jibes continuing the conversation he was having with hermione ron face darkened but he too said nothing it a good thing they dontcharge a registration fee malfoy smirked as the final gryffindor elizabeth richmond entered her name into the book and joined her housemates you d never be able to compete weasel king of course that wouldntnecessarily be a good thing since you ll be an easy knockout for the first slytherin you come across tell me did the slugs taste good they d almost have to after your mother cooking i suppose harry shot ron a warning look as the redhead face got steadily darker with suppressed fury alex scowled at the blonde you dontlearn so quick do you malfoy he spat i ll lay you out again if you really want me to as if on queue a large group of slytherins emerged from the dungeons they looked warily at the gryffindors fingering their wands obviously waiting for an excuse to use them you can try if you d like milton malfoy sneered i dontlike your chances of actually getting to me though oh sure hide behind your lackeys isabelle said with contempt you never were strong enough to fight your own battles malfoy glared at her you think so do you he said in a deadly quiet voice well we ll see wontwe he strode boldly past the gryffindors and jotted his name down in the book i ll see you all in the ring he breathed as he passed them again and disappeared into the great hall the group of slytherins followed him what an ass elizabeth dismissed him with a wave of her hand yeah ignore him ron greg added he not worth the air he breathes slimy git aaron davis muttered darkly glaring at malfoy retreating back wontlast two rounds michael wilde said dismissively oh i fully intend to see he doesntlast even one alex cracked his knuckles theatrically isabelle rolled her eyes at him get in line and no cutting she said with a straight face alex flashed her a quick grin the gryffindors began to drift away heading for breakfast harry grabbed ron sleeve as he made to walk away stopping him from leaving i need a word he said quietly ron looked at him oddly then shrugged fine he said following harry up the marble staircase and into a disused classroom what up what your problem harry asked bluntly ron expression immediately grew guarded and he took an almost unconscious step back what do you mean what my problem i donthave any problems ron harry said patiently last night was the first major fight you ve had with hermione in months and the first time you ve stormed off in longer you wouldntbe like that if something wasntwrong so what is it is it between the two of you or something else ron glared at him for a long moment but harry kept his expression neutral finally he sighed and dropped into a nearby chair running a hand through his hair distractedly alright fine if you re going to be like that my problem is with ginny ginny harry asked startled what on earth has she done she sleeping in your bed harry ron said in a pained voice do you have any idea what that like for me she my little sister harry nodded slowly imagining hermione sleeping in ron bed as the closest thing he had to a sister the thought was rather disturbing yeah i suppose i know what you mean but it not like we re going to do anything i mean you know how i feel about her i d never do anything to hurt her harry ron said in the same pained voice i know exactly how you feel about her because i feel the same thing about hermione and i ve wanted to shag her for months so that isntmaking me feel any better harry winced at the mental imagery ron proclamation brought up and immediately turned bright red that was something he didnt want to think about but you know i d never i mean he stammered unable to string a coherent sentence together that image just refused to leave his mind yeah i know ron sighed again dontworry it just me being overprotective again even in his somewhat befuddled state harry was surprised by ron candid admission i know you d never well he finished rather lamely his ears turning pink absolutely not harry agreed vigorously shaking his head wouldntdream of it well then now that all sorted ron stood up and headed for the door rather more quickly than was strictly necessary coming to breakfast or not harry his cheeks still flaming could only nod dumbly and follow hoping to any gods that were listening that ginny never heard about this review responses evansk well i was trying to put it nicely siriusfanatic oh dear i sympathise really i do i ve wanted to fall asleep in similar circumstances on more than one occasion whimsical firefly ahh well we can all do with a little fluff every now and again are you trying to tell me to take it out siriusblack08 harry dumbledore oh no i have something much more entertaining planned d aalikane indeed he would but he not stupid enough to say anything in front of ginny msmissprongs probably a good thing my computer desk has wheels gpotter best dunno about that i good but i not that good larna mandrea reviewer army you re not armed with pitchforks are you never mind loooong story harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n sorry for the slightly longer wait for this one but i ve been busy working on the last few chapters i have the rest of the story more or less planned out and there should be about another 30 chapters or so i think bloody hell 80 chapters good grief monday came and with it defense against the dark arts straight after breakfast harry had been looking forward to this lesson for months james had promised to teach them advanced dueling techniques and it was definitely going to come in handy in the near future he ron and hermione took their usual seats at the front of the classroom after hermione narrowly avoided a jelly legs jinx from james who had been hiding behind the door that had been happening all year as the professor had promised at random times he would crop up and try to curse a student usually with rather humorous results like the time he had hit malfoy with a well placed leg locker just as he had been about to sit down in the great hall resulting in him landing face first in a large bowl of mashed potatoes and then whole weeks would go by with nothing then out of the blue he would start up again every student attending hogwarts had learned the hard way to be alert and ready before entering his classroom and first and second years tended to bolt whenever they saw him coming right gather round you lot james commanded when the class had moved to the front of the room he banished the desks with a wave of his hand now today we re going to be doing advanced dueling techniques does anyone besides hermione know what that entails there was some good natured laughter from the gryffindors at james gentle teasing and hermione turned a rather fetching shade of pink the slytherins stayed silent many eyeing james with open loathing i ll take that as a no then james said calmly when the room remained silent pity i thought you of all people would know these draco your father was most skilled when i last dueled him incidentally next time you talk to him ask him how his leg healed up i noticed last time i saw him he walks with a cane now malfoy face turned white with suppressed anger but he wisely held his tongue several gryffindors sniggered dada lessons had been turning out more and more like this despite james earlier assertion that all houses should be equal he showed an even clearer favourism for the gryffindors than snape showed for the slytherins more likely than not as a method of irritating said professor now i dontactually expect any of you to be able to pull these moves off james continued many of them use raw magic in ways that you ve probably never experienced before but if you can master them they can come in extremely useful especially if you re looking to join the aurors or ministry security even if you re not in times like these your knowledge of such things may make all the difference between your life and your death so all of you pay attention james walked over to one of the bare classroom walls and the students followed automatically keeping some distance between the gryffindors and the slytherins observe james instructed then took a step backwards he leapt at the wall his feet making firm contact and began to run along sideways as if the wall were in fact the floor where his boots touched the wall sparks of pure magic could be seen leaving small scorch marks he ran along for several metres before leaping off the wall flipping over to land neatly on his feet the class stared at him in awe regardless of what you may think i did not use any more power to do that than any of you here possess he said calmly as if his feet had never left the ground every single person in this room is capable of such a feat if you can focus enough to make it happen as i said that trick uses raw magic so you dontneed your wand once you re on the wall your wand will be free to cast and of course it a very handy way to dodge a spell you cantblock any other way right everyone line up you re all going to have a try at this all it takes is enough will to make it happen and it will remember that not you james thrust out his arm to stop harry as he went to join the line this will be a little different for you just watch harry a little put out at his exclusion watched with some trepidation as seamus the first in the queue attempted to duplicate james earlier feat when he leapt at the wall however instead of running up it he smacked headfirst into it not quite finnegan james chuckled as the irish boy moved out of the way rubbing his nose where the cushioning charm hadntquite stopped all the impact next dean was next to try and he fared no better than seamus lavender managed to take about three steps along the wall before she fell to the floor with a squeal better james said approvingly helping her up much better you see what i mean it all in the will power yeah lavender said a little breathlessly i could feel something one should hope so james chuckled ushering her out of the way i do know what i talking about you know well most of the time next parvati only managed to smack her head when her turn came malfoy was next arrogantly running at the wall and receiving only a nasty bump on the head for his efforts when the cushioning charm seemed to weaken for a fraction of a second oops james said calmly sorry malfoy my fault next scowling darkly at the professor malfoy stalked across the room to sulk as crabbe and goyle both tried and failed miserably to run along the wall pansy parkinson didnteven make it to the wall she slipped over her own robes as she approached i think you d best sit this one out parkinson james said mildly as the slytherin girl glared at the wall as if it had somehow offended her with a humph she flounced off to join malfoy millicent bullstrode was also an abject failure blaise zabini managed get in a few steps before he too dropped to the floor but he was smirking triumphantly as he stood ignoring james helping hand nicely done james granted next next in line was hermione who stood staring at the wall for a long moment as if for once in her life she didntcomprehend what she had to do ron poked her lightly in the back and she hesitantly began to run she jumped at the wall but bounced off and dropped back to the floor with a squeal probably doesntmatter much james said dismissively dontworry hermione i ve seen your shield charm if there anyone in the school that can break through it they deserve to hermione turned pink again at the compliment and ron flashed james a discrete thumbs up the last thing any of them needed was hermione sulking because she d found something books couldnthelp her with ron james gestured at the wall ron nodded eagerly sprinting at the wall he got up sideways and managed a few steps before he too fell to the floor excellent james smiled knew you had it in you next the only person left was neville who was eyeing the wall with trepidation come on neville you can do it harry said encouragingly the round faced boy smiled hesitantly back then with a deep breath turned and ran for the wall typical longbottom malfoy drawled as neville bounced off the wall and landed on the floor with a loud thump too clumsy to even manage ten points from slytherin james interrupted harshly you didntmanage it either malfoy so shut your hole before i shut it for you malfoy mouth snapped shut and the look he directed at the dada professor was filled with loathing i hate you too james said without batting an eyelash and turned back to neville who was staring at the ground in shame would you like another shot neville i ll just stuff it up again he said miserably neville harry said firmly putting his arm around the other boy shoulders and speaking in a low voice remember what i said about you guarding my back come on i know you can do this neville sniffed then looked up and met harry gaze he was a little surprised to see the look of fierce determination in his expression neville blue eyes seemed to spark as he took another deep breath and said okay wordlessly harry stepped back neville stared at the wall for a long moment and then seemed to brace himself without warning he started running gaining momentum before he hit the wall his feet lifted off the ground firmly landing on the stones of the wall and he kept running much as james had done unlike james however neville kept going and ran smack into the wall at right angles to the one he was running along he dropped to the floor with a startled yelp landing hard on his rear there was stunned silence for a long time in the classroom it was james who finally broke into applause followed by the rest of the gryffindors absolutely brilliant james crowed hauling a red faced neville to his feet well done neville really well done only next time you might want to keep your eyes open neville let out a nervous laugh trying without much success to stifle his grin the bell that signaled the end of the lesson rang then the slytherins surged for the door but the gryffindors stayed a while to congratulate neville knew you had it in you dean punched the other boy playfully on the shoulder showed up malfoy right enough seamus chuckled little git did you see his expression he looked absolutely livid you d best watch your back neville neville let out a terrified squeak and almost automatically his eyes sought out harry who smiled slightly dontworry mate ron spoke up if he comes anywhere near you me and harry ll hex him into next week if i were any other professor i d take points from you for that weasley james chuckled fortunately for you i happen to feel the same way so i ll pull dumbledore trick and go temporarily deaf the gryffindors laughed and began to drift out of the classroom oh harry ron hermione james called after them as they made to leave they moved out of the way to let neville and dean past then turned to their professor curiously i ve been informed by mister filch that you three along with my vagrant son miss lestrange and miss weasley were involved in the recent prank on the teaching staff consequently i giving you all a weeks worth of detentions he winked at them as he spoke indicating the open door with a tilt of his head his meaning was fairly clear someone might be listening you are all to be here promptly at seven tonight and every night this week understood he smiled faintly understood harry said more than a little puzzled by their professor odd behaviour james smile widened as he ushered them out the door so potter harry had to fight the urge to smack his head into the wall when he heard malfoy drawl got yourself in trouble again have you pity milton didntexpel you but i suppose dumbledore would never allow it gryffindor golden boy he who can do no wrong sod off malfoy ron snarled very original weasel king malfoy sneered so i suppose there ll be a big party in gryffindor tower tonight to celebrate the fact that for once longbottom didnttrip over his own feet from their usual positions standing behind malfoy crabbe and goyle snickered no there won t hermione snapped there will be a party to celebrate the fact that longbottom beat the malfoy heir malfoy face darkened have a care mudblood he said softly and harry had to physically restrain ron from leaping at malfoy there are changes coming and if i were you i d be more careful about which side you choose with that said malfoy spun with a dramatic swirl of his robes and was gone arrogant slimy little bastard ron snarled looking about ready to murder come on harry hauled on his arm we need to go tell ginny isabelle and alex about what professor milton said i have a feeling it not about detention i wonder what he wants then hermione mused as they made their way to the great hall for lunch we ll find out tonight i suppose harry glanced at the staff table as they entered the hall and he could have sworn he saw james wink at him again review responses siriusblack08 oh gods not another halo 2 addict that game is starting to piss me off death to x box on that note cantwait for goldeneye rogue

so without further ado i ll hand you over to her more than capable hands enjoy cq note i dontbelieve that james actually let me do this i feeling like a little kid who been playing with her mom makeup or her dad tools without permission when james approached me to write a guest chapter for harry potter and the mind mage i think i may have surprised him with my reaction i couldntwait to get started and it just kind of flowed out of me i hope that what i ve come up with is what he was looking for when he approached me thank you so much james you have no idea of how thrilled i am to have contributed in this small way to your amazing fic albus dumbledore surveyed the room the war room at grimmauld place had been used as a headquarters for the order of the phoenix for several years now and he was getting used to it grubby charm not to mention the rather beguiling scent of molly weasley cooking that had permeated the house the woman was a first rate cook her apple pie alone well perhaps that was just his years of living alone eating school meals or perhaps it was just an old man feeling sorry for himself regardless there were a fast congregating crowd of order members to be addressed several topics were on the agenda for the night but only one was of true concern to the elderly wizard well perhaps concern was the wrong word apprehensive anxious shaking in his size tens why had he agreed to be the one to break the news to molly weasley that her two youngest children had joined the order he sighed he knew why he had made some monumental mistakes in his dealings with harry and young ginevra could be as intimidating as her mother for some reason he felt the need to make amends in some small way for his past transgressions he had a sneaking suspicion that harry may not care may simply get on with what he had to do without paying any further attention to an old wizard but miss weasley well he wouldntcare to cross her not when it came to harry at any rate he watched as order members filed in and took their seats not all of them were there of course hagrid never attended the meetings held here at grimmauld place nymphadora too had been excused and several other members were off seeing to order business the twelve who were now assembled in the long room which could easily have sat twice that many were all looking at him expectantly dumbledore sighed again emmeline vance cast him a cryptic look dumbledore smiled emmeline had run most things in her life with an iron fist for many years crossed only by those who either were ignorant of her acid tongue or who didntparticularly care if she took offense personally he thought ginny weasley fell into the latter category seeing her confront the older witch at the last meeting at the school had brought a rather satisfied smile to the old wizard face emmeline hadntbeen put in her place properly for years i glad to see you all here tonight he began we have several matters of order business to take care of many things have been happening which i wish to make you all aware of albus mad eye eyed him with his one good eye what passed for aconcerned look on the old auror face his magical eye spun in it socket alastor we must make the other order members aware of what has been going on around hogwarts are you certain that yes i am dumbledore nodded it is time very well alastor nodded leaning back in his seat his head turning as his magical eye took in everything around him coming to settle on mundungus fletcher who suddenly seemed very uncomfortable several months ago during the hogsmeade weekend young miss weasley was possessed by voldemort gasps around the room dumbledore didnttake his eyes from molly she was paper white her hand at her throat harry somehow exorcised him from her the sheer force of magic that the boy used was alarming to say the least he would not allow anyone near her even myself and carried her back to the castle himself the level of magical ability he has developed is quite astounding actually when ginevra awoke the light from the windows apparently was irritating her harry somehow sealed the room without the use of his wand and without apparently even thinking about it very hard it took me an entire day to remove the spell which had covered the windows blocking the offending light with a layer of stone harry has developed a level of magic it is truly amazing according to james milton there were several snorts of derision around the table and dumbledore paused despite what many of you may be feeling about james he is a man with his own demons i have every faith in his loyalty to harry and his children if no one else there was silence in the room no one dared question the headmaster faith in someone nobody but harry of course this power albus asked sturgis podmore how is it how is harry dealing with it i feel confident that despite a few hiccups harry will easily control it the power itself is being overseen by a familiar a familiar arthur looked at him his brow furrowing in thought but hedwig hedwig was merely pet and friend to harry the familiar has taken form as a basilisk more gasps yes the spirit of the basilisk from the chamber has chosen to align with harry as well he now carries with him a corporeal servant in the form of a serpent what molly asked stunned i believe that she calls herself zith albus smiled and i understand that she has taken quite a shine to her master and mistress what hiccups asked bill weasley i sorry dumbledore turned to him you said despite a few hiccups what has happened dumbledore looked at the younger wizard for a moment then nodded there have been two unfortunate incidents both are easily explained the first was by far the most serious of course so i feel that harry is learning to control albus emmeline vance glared at him what happened young draco malfoy made the unfortunate decision to harass a few of harry friends mister malfoy does not learn easily apparently one would think that after all these years he would tire of well harry rather lost control mr malfoy and two of his peers were pinned against a wall with a force of magic so strong that well they spent several hours in the hospital wing and i understand that poppy pomfrey had to use more than one cleansing charm on the young men in question harry put quite a fright into them bill couldnthelp but smile unfortunately that incident ended with harry teleporting himself and miss weasley away we were quite concerned for an hour or two apparating kingsley interupted fixing his gaze on the headmaster you cantapparate within hogwarts yes dumbledore smiled at him but i said teleporting not apparating it would appear that harry s ability is very different to what we term apparition it was while they were in the forest the forest molly said her voice cracking that they were approached by zith i have not quite worked out yet what this creature role is to play but i will ginny needs to come home molly began molly dumbledore looked at her when your daughter is away from harry or upset with him voldemort is able to access harry mind what ginny is somehow blocking voldemort access to harry but when she is physically not present or upset with harry dumbledore smiled at this ginny weasley had a temper similar to her mother s voldemort immediately takes advantage but we will speak further to this later dumbledore nodded to the weasleys suffice to say that more happened when harry brought ginny from the chamber than merely the saving of her life but when ginny is outside the wards of hogwarts she is vulnerable to voldemort as well when harry transported them to the forest voldemort took advantage i am sorry to say that the second possession was almost the end for harry what molly demanded albus the second miss weasley physically attacked harry a few days later he will have a rather permanent scar but his loyalty to her has not wavered in fact i believe he blames himself for not thinking of the wards but she s she fine now molly if rather pained at the thought of having hurt harry and harry arthur asked quietly he will be fine dumbledore said as a matter of fact with the advent of the young milton twins we have a return of i believe they are calling themselves the new marauders twinkling eyes glanced down the table at remus lupin whose grin was startling the werewolf seldom smiled dumbledore was immediately put in mind of the young man who had come to hogwarts all those years ago and been befriended by james potter and sirius black and the second incident asked bill yes well at the halloween ball a rather silly young man made inappropriate advances towards miss weasley dumbledore smiled at bill wince it did not go over very well at all charlie chuckled harry nearly put the little prat through a wall needless to say mr malfoy and mr corner are in general learning to avoid harry wrath mr malfoy however may require a reminder shortly his activities with concern to miss lestrange appear to be overriding his common sense lestrange molly paled the lestrange family had caused her own family much pain in past yes dumbledore nodded to my great surprise and delight the group seems to have adopted young isabelle lestrange into it ranks a death eater hestia jones asked shocked no miss jones dumbledore glanced at her a student a student who was originally sorted into slytherin more than likely on the basis of her family history miss lestrange however requested to be resorted this year she is in the fifth year and miraculously was resorted into gryffindor a trick kingsley asked i ve been thinking about this albus it possible no kingsley no trick i think the events during the attack on the school more than proved miss lestrange loyalties she as you know kingsley a student killed bellatrix lestrange during the attack on the school that student was bellatrix own daughter isabelle there was a moment of silence around the table while they all took this in harry generates great loyalty dumbledore said quietly and this both inspires me and frightens me why asked arthur because the boy has his own personal damned army that why the gruff voice of alastor moody came from the far end of the room and he beginning to question other people loyalty to him what does that mean molly asked harry has the devotion of a great deal of the student body in fact dumbledore sighed there is an inner group if you will who i believe would happily follow him into hell itself were he to find it necessary to go but he questioning their loyalty molly asked no not theirs dumbledore sighed again because he knows he can count on them he has begun to question the loyalty of others such as bill asked such as members of the order dumbledore said he asked nymphadora tonks directly if should she be given an order by me and a contradictory order by him who she would obey nymphadora came to me greatly upset by this why asked bill because dumbledore met the other man blue eyes with his own she didntknow how to respond there was a moment of profound silence in the room before dumbledore continued changing the subject the attack on hogwarts was not serious not serious molly cried no dumbledore shook his head it was merely a scare tactic we saw this regularly during the last war molly you know how he works but despite the fact that most of the teachers were spirited away what how arthur asked alarmed we re still trying to work that out dumbledore eyes sparkled suffice to say we were and the group surrounding harry and you can extend that to what is commonly referred to at the school as the da club those students who harry has been instructing proved to be well capable of dealing with voldemort supporters it was during this battle that bellatrix lestrange was killed and that is one of the reasons why he took a rather deep breath then plunged ahead i must inform those of you not in attendance at the last meeting held at hogwarts that we have acquired several new members new members arthur weasley said who dumbledore thought he saw charlie weasley eyes twinkle charlie loved a good fight and the young wizard was probably going to see fireworks tonight i had the pleasure of inducting several members at the last meeting who molly asked looking confused the order had not discussed the admittance of any new members in the near future unless albus dumbledore at the last meeting we inducted seven new members he continued softly harry potter hermione granger alexander and cassandra milton isabelle lestrange and ron and ginevra weasley albus dumbledore molly weasley jumped to her feet dumbledore met her eyes calmly looking over his half moon glasses at her molly you must listen i must do no such thing she yelled standing with arthur holding her left arm trying to pull her back into her chair you dare she spat you dare to go against our expressed wishes to keep them as far from this as possible molly dumbledore sat forward in his chair his elbows resting on the table and his fingers steepled it is no longer possible to keep them from this harry is aware that something draws near you know his fate ron is and has been for some years his best friend i doubt you could get him to leave his side now in any case and good luck getting your daughter away from him young ginevra has made her choice they ve been given the test and they have all proven worthy very worthy remus lupin commented from the end of the table remus bill looked down the table at him what do you mean i was there remus said along with emmeline and dedalus and a few others here personally i have never seen one more worthy than harry he too young molly shrieked they all are molly the group i ve just outlined held off an attack on the school nearly single handedly they may be young but they are ready harry must be made ready we know that and if you think that his friends are about to let him do this alone well dumbledore smiled you dontknow your daughter or your son very well molly elphias doge coughed from the end of the table his light was white all at the table were silent those who hadntbeen in attendance at the last meeting seemed rather speechless bright white unlike anything i ve ever seen ever elphias doge was perhaps the oldest order member besides dumbledore himself he had been a member of the original order and was a well respected member of this one white bill swallowed the purest white i ve ever seen and dumbledore smiled gently it was paired paired arthur sat straighter in his seat with whom albus smiled again and nodded your daughter arthur they re children molly cried arthur placed an arm around her looking rather surprised himself ginny is barely fifteen and already giving harry the strength he needs to wield the weapons he must if we are to survive albus said bill stiffened what exactly is that supposed to mean relax bill charlie grinned ron and i have already had a little talk with harry bill looked at him quizzically for a moment then his eyes widened and he smiled slightly i dontunderstand molly said quietly her eyes still brimming with tears why are my children the ones in the centre of this i would imagine it because you and arthur taught them to fight for what they believe in molly albus said and both ron and ginevra believe in harry potter jm note well there you have it normal format again for the next chapter which may be out as soon as tomorrow if my blasted muses decide to cooperate review responses will be posted in that chapter until then ciao harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n so much for the tomorrow mentioned in the last chapter this one took a little longer than i though it would oh well enjoy about time you lot showed up james grinned at the group of gryffindors as they filed into his classroom at seven o clock sharp that evening his keen eyes immediately picked out an addition to the group and he raised his eyebrow at his daughter i dontseem to recall requesting your presence cass he said mildly i know you didn t she said calmly but you re up to something and i want in i should have known james chuckled ruefully shaking his head you re far more like your mother than you ll ever know it would take a trained listener to hear the slight catch in his voice as he spoke and only the most aware observer would notice the very small tightening around his eyes right he said crisply i sure you re all curious as to why you re here as you may have gathered the detention is only a cover story as i know very well that it was only harry ginny and my darling children involved in that prank and no punishment will be given as i also know why you did it that was you ron gaped at harry it was mostly ginny work actually harry shrugged she the one who good at transfiguration not me and what are we dragon liver alex demanded with a quirky smile you mean norbert liver cassie added with a grin yes well james interrupted when we ve all stopped making bad jokes we ll get to work hmm everyone silenced immediately much better now i suppose at least one of you has made the connection everyone you summoned is entered into the duelling tournament hermione answered immediately and i should have known it would be you james laughed a small pleased smile crossed hermione lips and ron grinned at her so as hermione pointed out correctly with the exception of miss tag along at this cassie stuck her tongue out at her father you re all entered into the tournament now does that suggest anything to any of you isntthat against the rules hermione frowned isntwhat against the rules ron asked in confusion now really hermione james said in an injured tone do you really think that i of all people would go about breaking rules yes alex and cassie said simultaneously exactly james grinned at them now do you want to be trained to beat the snot out of malfoy or not you re going to train us for the tournament harry asked incredulously of course i am james said airily besides the whole point of this thing is to help you train for battle with death eaters right well i ve had enough first hand experience to show you how it done properly and if it helps you win the tournament well bending the rules rather than breaking them alex smirked now you re getting it james smirked back convenient timing that all it is pure coincidence of course if dumbledore wasntsuch an overprotective old codger i would have started this months ago but he off at an order meeting tonight at headquarters brilliant ron said enthusiastically where do we start simple james raised his voice tonks will you stop doing that tonks glared at the mind mage in frustration as she let the invisibility cloak slip down to her shoulders probably not james said blandly i need you to work with this lot while i have a word with harry fair enough you do want them prepared for any eventualities dontyou he added seeing tonks hesitate fine she sighed but if dumbledore finds out i blaming all this on you buster james shrugged whatever makes you happy nymph now go play with the children while i speak to harry children alex said in an outraged tone as tonks herded the group minus harry to the other side of the room oh you ll pay for that one dad right harry james said in a quiet voice ignoring his son outburst i sure you haventforgotten the snake living in your head yes harry thought that was stating the obvious just a bit although his basilisk familiar had quietened down over the last few months there were still occasional random incidents the last had been only a few days ago when harry had inadvertently summoned ginny from across the common room to land squarely in his lap harry could still feel his cheeks burning just from the thought now dumbledore thinks you ve had enough time to adjust to it presence and it about time you started to learn to harness the power it possesses james went on his intensely blue eyes watching harry carefully how do i do that harry asked as if on queue he felt that odd stirring within his mind that signified his familiar was awake it not something you ll ever have direct control over the human mind cannot handle that much power which is why we have familiars james explained what about your own power harry had to ask i mean you re more powerful than me so why can you handle so much an interesting question james granted it works a little differently in my case though in the simplest terms it not just my mind that handles my power it my whole being but that not what we re talking about we re talking about you and your familiar now to put it simply all you ll really be able to do is give commands and leave it up to the basilisk to follow them even though it a part of you it still a separate entity and it will use the power it has been granted in the best way it sees fit which should mean however will benefit you most should well it not the most exact thing in the world james said wryly i knew a wizard years ago who had a familiar that decided the best way to keep him alive was to encase him in solid stone in the middle of a duel he died harry gasped his skin crawled at the very notion i never said that james corrected i said he was encased in stone luckily i got there before his supply of air ran out oh harry said weakly dontworry that sort of thing doesnthappen very often james dismissed his worries my point is you wontbe able to predict exactly how a familiar will react in any given situation that incidentally is why i stopped you from trying the wall running exercise earlier today i didntparticularly want your familiar to decide the best way for you to run along the wall would be to pull it down i ve seen some rather bizarre reactions to very normal situations before so i thought it a good idea not to start experimenting with unusual circumstances harry agreed wholeheartedly he had no wish to be buried under a pile of rubble besides you probably wontneed that sort of trick anyway james added a familiar is allowed to bend all sorts of rules like being able to teleport inside the wards of hogwarts you ll find it will come up with all sorts of interesting ways to protect you from danger hang on harry objected a thought occurring to him what about the battle he hadntthought about it before but when he had been fighting the death eaters that had penetrated the wards there had been no sign of his familiar my fault james admitted i thought it might make things a little unpredictable in the heat of battle to have you running around without training so i temporarily cut your link to your familiar you can do that harry asked startled what to stop voldemort from doing the same thing the spell can only be performed by someone whom you trust without question thanks for the vote of confidence by the way james flashed harry a grin well you re about the only adult that hasntlied to me yet harry muttered under his breath look harry i know you ve heard this a million times before and i know it doesntmake things any better but dumbledore had his reasons for keeping things from you james said seriously just remember that hindsight is always twenty twenty but foresight isntnearly so reliable heck look at trelawney harry had to chuckle at the thought of the batty old divination professor whose favourite pastime was predicting harry death in a new and gruesome way every divination lesson harry was immensely grateful that he no longer had to put up with her right i think we d best join your friends before young nymph gets carried away james said with a chuckle breaking harry from his thoughts with a quick nod harry followed the defence professor across the room his mind preoccupied with what he had just learned alex cass your father is a slave driver isabelle groaned as the seven gryffindors staggered into the common room hours later and collapsed into seats before the fire merlin i dontthink i ve ever felt this tired try living with him cassie said with a wry smile of the seven only she and alex seemed to be relatively unaffected by the rigorous training james had just put them through you get used to it pretty quickly trust me harry tuned the conversation out he was absolutely exhausted he laid his head down on ginny shoulder his mind whirling with what he had learned over the course of the lesson while tonks had attempted to teach the others how to cast spells without their verbal component james had tried to teach him how to teleport as he called it it was harder than it looked every time he had done it in the past had been on instinct and to actually sit down and attempt to explain to his familiar exactly what he wanted was incredibly difficult his problem had culminated when he had been distracted at a critical moment and instead of teleporting himself five feet to the left as he was supposed to he ended up almost on top of ginny right as she was practicing casting her trademark bat bogey hex without words thankfully the lack of a verbal component lessened the effects of the spell and james managed to reverse the effects all the while laughing fit to burst ginny herself had been wavering between mortification and amusement one thing was certain however harry was never going to annoy ginny again ever of course hermione had mastered the art in a very short time culminating in her hitting ron from across the room with a tickling charm the rest of them however had not fared as well harry smiled as he remembered isabelle reaction this is silly she had announced after nearly an hour of trying to cast even the most simple spell if i want to blow up the bloody bottle i ll do this reducto the butterbeer bottle they had been practicing on had quite literally exploded leaving a very smug looking isabelle until of course tonks caught her completely unawares with a body bind curse she had toppled over with a loud thump her startled oath cut off as the wind was knocked out of her that my dear isabelle is why this is useful james had said urbanely as he removed the curse and pulled her to her feet if you dontknow a curse is coming you cantblock it understood harry glanced over at the ex slytherin she had her head resting on alex chest and her eyes were closed it suddenly struck him how much she d changed since she had been re sorted into gryffindor the hard edge had gone from her face and the slight tightness around her eyes that had been perpetually present had disappeared harry glanced up and caught alex eyes without changing expression alex glanced down at the girl half asleep in his arms and then back up to harry he nodded slightly and mouthed the words thank you harry grinned at him in response returning the nod as best he could with his head on ginny shoulder the redhead caught the motion and her eyes opened she glanced across the room at alex who was now stroking isabelle hair softly and then looked down at harry what she whispered under the sounds of cassie and hermione discussing the relative merits of non verbal spells while ron tried his best not to look bored nothing harry replied quietly just something isabelle harry ginny laughed softly you re incredible you know that he smiled up at her hardly how many other people can honestly say they ve managed to convert a slytherin into a gryffindor she asked pointedly i didntdo that harry objected quietly she did all the work not me but you re the one that showed her the way and helped her when no one else would ginny returned if it wasntfor you including her in that photo she d still be a slytherin outcast yeah i suppose harry sighed it nothing to be ashamed of silly ginny shook her head i can guarantee you she happier here than she ever was in slytherin harry didntreply he sat in silence his head still resting on ginny shoulder watching alex gently lift isabelle into his arms he muttered something as he got close to the girl staircase and disappeared up them without a word why does he get to know that password and we don t ron complained as he watched the pair retreat because ron my brother has a knack for getting into places he not supposed to be anyway cassie said trust me if he didnthave the password he d find some other way up there still not fair ron grumbled oh ron hermione scolded what on earth would you want to go up there for anyway he waggled his eyebrows at her and she immediately turned beet red do you really have to ask love you re impossible she said smiling in spite of herself and on that note cassie said standing i going to bed before this gets any more cloying i ll see you all in the morning yeah we d best get to bed too ginny said quietly to harry i have potions first thing in the morning and you know how much snape would love for me to fall asleep on the side of the cauldron harry chuckled and on impulse copied alex earlier movements and swiftly gathered her up into his arms ginny squealed as he twirled her around a bit clasping her arms around his neck i can walk you know she said as he started up the stairs to the boy dorms not when i around you can t he grinned at her prat she said affectionately pulling herself up to kiss him keep that up weasley and i might just drop you harry swung her around so her head nearly hit the stone wall dontyou dare she squealed harry james potter if you drop me i swear i will never forgive you probably a good thing i not going to then harry grinned down at her planting a kiss on her forehead as he carried her over to his bed she scowled at him pulling her wand from her pocket and transfiguring her school robes into a nightdress what she asked at harry inquisitive look i too tired to be bothered going all the way up to my dorm okay she separated the curtains and he deposited her onto the bed then climbed in after her firmly pulling the hangings shut behind him a n next chapter might be the start of the tournament if you re all good i for one am much looking forward to seeing malfoy get flattened d review responses windcall as a fellow sirius fan i know where you re coming from dontworry you ll find out why he came back eventually jacko mate if you re a loser then so am i i spend a ridiculous amount of money on books hpgirl7777 i seem to have a knack for picking the right names harry ginny4eva hey rambling is good so dontworry the tests were great it just a pity we lost out on the one dayer though stupid sheep fu whoops did i say that out loud let hear it go aussie go talix the fics where harry pushes everyone away just piss me off because i really cantsee ron or hermione ever letting him get away with it i hope the differences between the weasley twins and the milton twins became a little more pronounced as the story went on and if they haven t well they will and it not the first time i ve been called ludicrously odd and i guessing it wontbe the last elmire wow i think that the first time i ve been complimented in french d the speed that everything is developing is quite deliberate and was commented on by james quite some time ago at the ball they dontwant things to progress this fast but they cantreally stop it the comments about australia being the best were tongue in cheek mostly designed to tweak the noses of any americans a bit of fun nothing more crimson jenn i can take the rebuff for my anti americanism but if you insult cricket again i will hunt you down p just kidding kazziedal wow flattery much i have a seventh year sequel planned and might take it further if people are really keen might be interesting to do a fic about james andburn1 you might want to go back and read the author notes at the top of last chapter mate hermionegreen all will be revealed eventually dree hey who else am i going to get to do it cq writes a brilliant molly mistress genari that was one of my favourite lines in that chapter shotgunn lets just say that without you it probably would never have occurred to me cheers mate george heichelheim erm thanks but i already knew how to do italics and bold mate why did you feel the need to explain it merusa twas a rather good idea to get cq to write that chapter if i do say so myself still going on brethren of ares harryginny i wouldntbe too sure of that msmissprongs erm you said what with a who now harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n sorry about the delay my muses have been on holiday again it seems still i have the next chapter already written and as soon as i get it back from cq i ll post it too should only be a day or two once again a million thanks to cq for her brilliant job as beta now on with the chapter it was seven very exhausted gryffindors that stumbled down to breakfast on saturday morning the week of training had been intense although in harry opinion well worth it james and tonks had run them through many different exercises and tests trying to find each student strength hermione for example had begun to master phasing or the ability to instantaneously move oneself a few feet in any direction obviously quite useful in a duel and more than making up for her lack of agility ron had spent most of the time practicing the different forms of raw magic that james had demonstrated and could now duplicate the wall running feat with relative ease although he also had the sense to jump off the wall at the appropriate time isabelle had shown an aptitude for personal transfiguration possibly because of her animagi abilities and had worked closely with tonks to develop these skills it was rather unnerving to see the ex slytherin turn her entire forearm into a razor sharp scythe like blade and back again seemingly at will rather surprisingly neither alex nor cassie had shown any specific aptitudes although this didntseem to overly bother them hey we re just multi talented alex had quipped after one of their lessons earning him a scowl from a tired and rather irritable ron harry was beginning to learn some control over his familiar although his attention still tended to wander at a critical moment and the results while usually humorous were also unpredictable the basilisk seemed to genuinely want to help although it definition of help and harry own seemed to be world apart at least ginny no longer seemed to be affected by everything he did as she had previously finally ginny had proven to be reasonably talented at glamoury a form of illusionary magic that involved tampering with the perceptions of others it not technically legal for anyone to use it who doesnthave a license from the ministry tonks had explained in a rather pained voice i hardly think it matters at this point nymph james pointed out well no i suppose not tonks had sighed just please dontuse it unless you absolutely have to and so saturday was on them before they even realised harry truly felt sorry for the hufflepuff and ravenclaw quidditch teams the second game of the year was to be held today only two days before the start of the tournament there were several people on each team entered so the game was rather poor timing for them ron watched disinterestedly as the two teams left the hall i wish them the best of luck he said with a yawn but i going back to bed harry blinked this was the first time in his hogwarts career than ron had willingly missed a game of quidditch he was usually one of the first ones at the pitch no matter the teams playing yeah sounds like a plan alex rubbed his eyes bloody hell i never want to see that classroom again well look at it this way hermione said her lowered voice barely carrying under the noise in the hall do you want to beat malfoy or not course i do alex scowled across the hall to where the blonde slytherin sat between crabbe and goyle i gonna smash his bloody face in and i going to enjoy myself immensely hear hear mate ron yawned again i think you need more sleep ron cassie noted cheekily gee you think ron shot back how very observant of you now now children keep it civil isabelle smirked at them i ll keep you civil ron said sourly ron that doesnteven make sense hermione said in exasperation come on you re going back to bed and with that she stood grabbed his arm and dragged him out of the hall hermione gone all gung ho all of a sudden cassie noted i wonder why gung ho ginny asked in confusion muggle thing alex told her never mind harry had to agree it was rather peculiar behaviour for hermione and he had no clue what could be causing it he supposed it was probably just ron yet again which meant he had little to no business butting in surely hermione would tell me if anything major was happening but even so there was the small niggling doubt that refused to go away mister potter professor mcgonagall approached the gryffindor table that night at dinner professor dumbledore would like to see you all in his office tonight thanks professor harry replied politely mcgonagall nodded swiftly then turned and made her way back up towards the head table order isabelle asked under her breath probably harry agreed he did say that mcgonagall would tell us when there was one on as soon as they had finished eating the seven made their way up to dumbledore office harry opened the gargoyle that blocked the entrance and the revolving staircase deposited them in front of the imposing door enter the headmaster voice came from within and harry pushed the door open so nice of you to finally join us snape said bitingly as they filed into the room aside for the potions master and dumbledore the room also contained professor mcgonagall lupin mad eye moody emmeline vance and ronald and ginevra weasley aw heck ron groaned as mrs weasley bustled forwards an angry expression on her face what in merlin name do the two of you think you re doing signing up for the order without asking me first hi mum ginny said brightly ignoring the outburst dontyou hi mum me young lady mrs weasley said in a dangerous tone you are both in a lot of trouble molly please we have been through this already dumbledore said his beard twitching as he fought not to smile dontyou start again headmaster mrs weasley turned to glare at him i still not happy with you either mum please ron started we i dontcare mrs weasley near screeched you deliberately went against your parents wishes molly mad eye thundered and the room instantly stilled another time please he said gruffly thankyou alastor dumbledore murmured as mrs weasley glared at him but re took her seat now we have several important points to cover tonight so i d suggest we get on with it severus are you any closer to synthesising that potion unfortunately not headmaster snape stood and glanced around the room almost disdainfully i am still having some difficulty getting the mix right so as to make it not too strong but not too weak i would estimate another few weeks ought to be enough excellent dumbledore nodded approvingly remus the housing situation we ve got another few places warded and ready to go remus replied as snape sat again we ll have another two ready within a week which should get the number of people at headquarters manageable again dumbledore nodded again sooner than i had expected well done emmeline the dursley s at the sound of his relative name harry ear pricked up he had not been back to see them since dumbledore had revealed they were at the castle he had seen no particular need the wards are almost ready the stately old witch replied i would give a few more days for them to strengthen and it should be possible for the muggles to return to their home excellent work dumbledore smiled i for one will be glad to have them out of hogwarts professor all eyes turned at ginny as she stood does that mean harry will have to go back to them this summer dumbledore nodded reluctantly and harry heart sank i am afraid so miss weasley it is still the safest place for him to be the events of the summer passed not withstanding we have strengthened the wards on the house and we will be doubling the number of guards it will be perfectly safe that what you said last time ron muttered fortunately his mother didnthear him professor isabelle half raised her hand what am i going to do for the summer holidays my mother well you all know about her and my aunt was killed during the last death eater attack on london why on earth didntyou tell me alex demanded it wasntimportant she shrugged i do not know miss lestrange dumbledore said his voice troubled perhaps you can stay at headquarters we shall see as the date comes nearer what options present themselves why canti stay at headquarters too harry demanded dontbe so thick potter snape sneered severus dumbledore said warningly sorry headmaster snape said sounding anything but dumbledore removed his half moon glasses and rubbed at his eyes tiredly harry you know that while headquarters is relatively safe it still does not have any of your blood relatives living there and therefore is not as secure as your aunt and uncle house what like it was so secure before harry said bitterly ginny squeezed his hand reassuringly dumbledore sighed heavily replacing his glasses on his crooked nose the order members present were watching him carefully waiting to see how he reacted we shall see as the date grows closer harry none in the room missed the headmaster using harry first name and they both received several curious stares now dumbledore straightened in his chair and fixed his piercing gaze on the seven students in the room i have reason to believe that you have all been taking some extracurricular training this past week harry and hermione exchanged a glance wondering what to tell the headmaster isabelle solved their problem by simply saying yes sir we have i see dumbledore eyes twinkled as they turned to tonks who had removed her invisibility cloak and was now squirming uncomfortably nymphadora would you care to comment tonks sighed settling heavily into one of the comfortable seats that lined the office james she said shortly headmaster i really must protest his presence in this school emmeline vance interjected he is reckless unreliable and we still have no solid confirmation of his loyalty how do we know he is not working for voldemort on the side as he was last time a fair question dumbledore granted very well i will tell you why i have such confidence in james current loyalty out of the corner of his eye harry noticed both alex and cassie expression tighten although where cassie merely looked sad alex looked about ready to start smashing things or people early this year or possibly at the very end of last year death eaters approached james with a proposition that he should join them or suffer the consequences james being james he ignored them and the result was that his wife was brutally raped and murdered in from of his children very eyes a shocked gasp ran through the room emmeline looked about ready to be sick and moody had a very ugly expression on his face cassie eyes filled with tears and her twin leaned over to wrap a comforting arm about her shoulders his face still filled with a towering albeit tightly controlled rage he is not so much with us as against the dark lord dumbledore said gently he will do everything within his considerable power to see that he falls i emmeline faltered her usual composure temporarily deserting her i am sorry headmaster i never knew what i have told you does not go beyond this room dumbledore said looking around the room warningly of course it doesn t nothing ever does moody said in a disgusted tone i wonder if milton needs any help when he goes after that son of a bitch regardless dumbledore said with a faint smile there is still the issue of him training students without my permission what you re going to complain about him teaching us to defend ourselves harry demanded tired of all the convoluted talk of course not dumbledore said mildly i just wish he d come to me first is all i sure i could have made a few suggestions that would have benefited you all harry stared at the headmaster not quite sure what to say now he addressed the students you all have a rather full week ahead of you so i d suggest you all get as much rest as possible potter a word moody said gruffly as they stood and made to file out of dumbledore office what harry asked shortly as ginny the last in line slipped out the door not here moody muttered then turned to look at the headmaster if that all albus by all means dumbledore gave them leave and harry rather warily followed the grizzled auror from the room you shouldntbe so hard on dumbledore moody said suddenly as they reached the bottom of the winding staircase and started down the corridor harry eyes widened momentarily in shock but quickly narrowed again why shouldnti harry shot back he knew it was probably not a good idea to speak like that to mad eye moody but he was beyond caring not like he can do anything to you anyway otherwise they ll never get rid of voldemort said a snide little voice in his head because potter he the only one who actually knows what you re going through moody growled his magical eye spinning every which way as it looked for anyone who might be eavesdropping yeah right how could he harry muttered darkly because he been through all this before you arrogant little twit moody ground out or have you forgotten what happened between him and grindelwald what that got to a memory dawned on harry suddenly of reading the back of a chocolate frog card on the hogwarts express way back in first year dumbledore defeated him he said slowly yes he bloody well did moody confirmed so if you think you re the only one who ever had to go through this think again but donttake my word for it ask james after all he was there moody turned and stumped back towards the entrance to the headmaster office you might want to think about that he called back over his shoulder before he vanished up the stairs leaving harry to make his way back to gryffindor tower alone his mind whirling with questions a n next chapter the tournament begins who looking forward to seeing malfoy get flattened poll who gets to flatten malfoy the one with the most votes gets the prize a harry b ron c alex d isabelle you have about two weeks to get your votes in i so looking forward to writing this scene review responses mosleyn001 you gave me a great idea with your last comment cheers gpotter nope never got the poa dvd i cantstand the movies myself the casting is great but they changed too much maybe i just being picky but i feel like hitting things every time i see a stuff up and they made lupin look like a complete tosser grr phoenix of hogwarts oh boy i feel this needs some explanation i d like to state from the outset i have nothing against americans in fact i have quite a few american friends my problem is with the overwhelming arrogance the american nation displays in its dealings with foreign nations as well as the there no problem that cantbe fixed with liberal application of bullets and or bombs philosophy the american government has displayed since the end of the second world war as an australian i take pride in my nation and the amount of americans that talk down to me simply because i not american well it tends to piss me off fairly effectively i sorry if it offends you but i think americans as a group are generally unaware of exactly how low their international standing is the great american nation has become a bit of a joke in the last few decades but like i said my problem is with the american government not americans themselves comet moon that was more wishful thinking than anything else mrssakurapotter erm thanks i think dragonsoul indeed it is my friend although over here it was published as a trilogy magician silverthorn and a darkness at sethanon probably my second favourite fantasy series after eddings but who the heck is piers anthony the series was written by raymond fiest merusa blinks was that comment aimed at me and if so what d i do nothing wrong with being jealous of a character in a fic but would you really want to trade places dree it all cq fault the moonlight path i know what you mean but it deliberate there is method in the madness my friend trust me elmire you d think so the problem is my muses dontseem to know how to take no for an answer dontworry i used to long rambly reviews i give enough of them myself so keep them coming jwhit moony if you even think about it i swear i wontupdate for a month and i sure i can persuade cq to join me lord sauron the deciever so you beat us once did you see the game we played against pakistan absolutely

computer now let us all pray she gets said problems resolved asap so she can begin work on her next masterpiece oh yes i almost forgot two stories i beta ing have been nominated for the accio fanfiction awards big round of applause for whimsical firefly sirius choice and creativequill trust and if you haventread their stories already what more incentive do you need exactly monday dawned to find the grounds of hogwarts covered by the thick layer of white the results of a heavy snowstorm the night before classes had been cancelled for this last week of term and a feeling of tense excitement could be felt throughout the castle most notably within those who would compete in the tournament harry woke early that same sense of excitement translating itself into nervousness he wasntreally worried about his own performance rather that of those students he had taught it would directly reflect on his ability to teach and would show once and for all if he d actually accomplished something over the last few months or if he d been wasting his time his heart almost stopped when he felt something stirring beside him in bed only to realise it was ginny he didntthink he d ever get used to that the smirks of his roommates had almost been enough to send him to mcgonagall to request a private room almost he shuddered to think of what would happen if the stern deputy headmistress ever found out about their sleeping arrangements it seemed to take an age but finally ten o clock rolled around and with it the start of the tournament the gryffindor competitors left the common room to a rousing cheer from their housemates and with harry in the lead they made their way to the entrance hall where they found the slytherin and ravenclaw entries already in attendance the hufflepuffs joined them a moment later harry tried to ignore the smirk on malfoy face concentrating instead on the double doors leading into the great hall they had been told that mcgonagall would come to retrieve them when everything was ready finally the doors opened and mcgonagall emerged good you re all here she nodded curtly when you enter the hall i would like you all to go to the corner decorated with your house colours you will find your heads of house there with more instructions she turned and re entered the hall short and sweet alex muttered as they followed her making for the corner resplendent in gryffindor colours it was not mcgonagall who waited for them though she had vanished through a side door near where the staff table usually stood but now was an empty place come on hurry it up james grinned at them from the gryffindor area professor milton greg redfield asked in confusion but professor mcgonagall has other duties so i ve been appointed temporary head of gryffindor for today james informed them now get your butts into gear and take a seat smiling they all did as instructed each taking a seat on one of the chairs that had appeared at his words right we re using standard duelling format for this james said everyone know what that means yes good i ll just refresh your memory on the more salient points then no physical contact wands only nothing lethal pity harry heard alex mutter to isabelle i was so looking forward to being able to flatten malfoy again you still can james grinned at his son obviously having heard every word just not with your fists savvy alex grinned back viciously of course dear father he said innocently good james winked at him then turned back to the rest of the group right first round is standard two on two so you d best all pick your partners the first round will begin very very soon the noise was incredible huge stands had been erected around the perimeter of the hall and these were filled to overflowing with students all cheering and waving flags with their house insignia on them the middle of the room had been cleared and a standard duelling ring had been drawn on the flagstones complete with shields to stop stray curses from hitting the crowd the first match was between hermione ron and two seventh year ravenclaw students the results were fairly predictable hermione took down one boy with an incapacitator curse a spell shown to them by tonks that was an odd combination of a stunner and full body bind while ron took down the second when he managed to deflect the boy own disarming hex back on him with a well timed shield charm and followed up with a stunner gryffindor win mcgonagall magically amplified voice rang through the hall and a very pleased hermione and ron made their way back to the gryffindor corner while madam pomphrey rushed out onto the ring to tend to the fallen students most impressive dumbledore murmured aside to mcgonagall who had retaken her seat next to him harry seems to have them well educated in defending themselves he does rather doesnthe mcgonagall said with a note of pride the next match was malfoy and blaise zabini against two hufflepuffs which ended rather abruptly when one of the hufflepuffs collapsed in a heap after being hit in the back with a reductor curse the other turned to look at the teacher stand an outraged look on her face and was taken down by malfoy stunner cheater ron roared from his place beside harry as the majority of the crowd booed and malfoy swaggered back towards his housemates you cantdo that he can actually james said grimly as the girl hit with the reductor curse was stretchered from the ring a smoking hole in the back of her robes it bad form but since it not actually lethal there no rules that says he can t you all have to be very very careful against the slytherins got that they wontplay around and they donthave any qualms about hitting you when your back turned harry and ginny who were partnered and going up against a pair of slytherin seventh years in their first match exchanged a slightly worried look professor harry spoke up a moment later could you do that spell on me again the one that cuts my link to you know james looked at him closely then shook his head you gryffindors are far too noble for your own good he muttered why on earth would you give up your biggest advantage because voldemort doesntknow about it yet does he harry said with a smile no point tipping my hand before i ready is there james stared at him for a moment then threw back his head and laughed every time i think i ve got you pegged you go ahead and surprise me he chuckled fine let get started before malfoy spots anything the next match between harry potter and ginny weasley for gryffindor and megan turner and chris chambers for slytherin mcgonagall magically amplified voice carried to every corner of the hall and from his place in the ring harry tensed ginny stood beside him her wand at the ready and her back proudly straight begin harry immediately shot a stunner at chris and dove out of the way of his return spell which judging by the way it sizzled against the flagstones couldnthave been pleasant he came to his feet a few feet from the shields and levelled his wand at chris again the two traded spells for a short time and harry was faintly conscious of ginny doing the same with megan harry shield charm deflected a tripping hex from the slytherin boy and he returned with an impediment jinx that just managed to slip through chris defences the slytherin movements slowed and harry was just about to follow up with a stunner when ginny shoved him out of the way of a body bind from megan too slow potter chris yelled as he regained full movement and leapt across the ring to join megan you okay ginny muttered to harry who nodded ginny robes were torn at her right shoulder and a small amount of blood stained the edges of the rip come on lets finish these two off i getting bored right ginny helped harry up and they stood side by side the dual defence you reckon worth a try ginny smiled kneeling in front of him harry took a deep breath and levelled his wand to the two smirking slytherins what decided not to give up yet megan taunted really there no need for you be humiliated any further you know she followed her statement with a disarming hex aimed at ginny speculum she yelled swishing her wand the air in front of her appeared to shimmer and curve in on itself and when the jet of red light reached it it seemed to elongate quite suddenly the spell reversed course taking a very surprised megan in the stomach harry deftly summoned her wand before she could recover and finished her off with a stunner nice trick potter chris nodded slightly pity it wontwork twice commoveo the powerful spell blew through ginny shield and struck her injured shoulder she let out a cry as she was lifted off the ground and spun through the air landing in a heap a few yards away gin harry cried ducking a second spell from chris he half spun and sent a stunner at the slytherin boy forcing him to duck out of the way and followed up with a body bind chris barely managed to get off a shield charm before the spell hit him deflecting it harmlessly into the ground ginny moaned softly half sitting up and shaking her head to clear it ouch she muttered her whole body ached evidence of its rather hard impact with the floor she blinked hard noting blood flowing over her left eye judging by the sharp stinging pain in her forehead there was a rather large would where her head had hit the stone floor she raised her head enough to be able to see harry and chris duelling hard the slytherin ducked another spell from harry and returned with a disarming hex which harry deflected with another shield charm finally seeming to grow tired of the back and forth play harry stood his ground levelled his wand and roared praecipito chris barely had time to let out a startled oath before he was thrown violently across the floor straight towards ginny who by that time had located her wand and cleared her eyes of blood stupefy she said through clenched teeth as the helpless slytherin slid to a stop not four feet from her he collapsed in a boneless heap as her spell took him cleanly in the chest gryffindor win mcgonagall voice echoed through the hall once again accompanied by a round of cheers from not only the gryffindors but also the hufflepuffs and ravenclaws who enjoyed seeing slytherins put in their place harry didnthear the great wall of noise however he was far more concerned with ginny wellbeing he hurried over to her helping her to her feet are you alright he asked breathlessly as she smiled wanly up at him i fine harry she assured him as madam pomphrey rushed into the ring to tend the two downed slytherins just a scratch she tried to take a step but her legs buckled beneath her and if not for harry firm grip she would have slid back to the ground come on you need to sit down harry wrapped one of her arms around his shoulders you took a pretty bad hit you know yeah i suppose she sighed allowing harry to help her to the gryffindor corner james met them there a concerned look in his eyes bring her here he ordered indicating a chair harry led her to the chair and helped her sit trying not to fuss as she winced in pain james ran his hands over her shoulder frowning in concentration a soft blue glow emanated from his palms broken shoulder he murmured that spell must have hit pretty hard broken shoulder harry asked startled i didnteven notice ginny said ruefully james shook his head gryffindors he muttered under his breath hang on a minute i ll just go get madam pomphrey she ll be able to fix this up quick smart and you he pointed almost menacingly at ginny are not to move a muscle until i get back have i made myself clear perfectly sir it was now ginny turn to be startled as james stalked away his robes billowing out behind him in a very snape ish manner what was that all about ginny asked in bewilderment alex chuckled dad gets a bit overprotective sometimes count yourself lucky you have the most powerful man in england looking out for you well except for maybe dumbledore and voldemort they were silent until james returned with madam pomphrey each lost in their own thoughts once she had seen to ginny shoulder and checked her over for any other injuries she declared her fit enough and left not one to waste words is she isabelle said dryly as they watched the matron retreating back they never are james said cryptically harry was distracted from trying to puzzle out his meaning when mcgonagall called out the next match alex and isabelle verses two ravenclaws the match was pretty much a foregone conclusion between alex enormous repertoire of spells and isabelle slytherin learned cunning the ravenclaws never knew what hit them that was easy alex remarked as he and isabelle returned to the gryffindor corner although he was limping slightly where he had been hit by a stray curse dontget overconfident hermione warned but he waved her off i know hermy he said resignedly dontcall me that she said rather testily of course not hermy he replied amicably hermione dropped her head into her hands and groaned the next match was between aaron davis and greg redfield for gryffindor and two hufflepuff sixth years harry almost groaned aloud when aaron was hit almost immediately by a disarming hex and eliminated greg did alright managing to take down one of his rivals with a body bind but was stunned soon after too bad mate ron said sympathetically as the pair as they made their way back to the corner after being checked out by madam pomphrey ahh well better luck next time greg shrugged shouldnthave underestimated the puffs aaron muttered to himself probably not the best idea no alex agreed with him gryffindor won their last match of the day michael wilde and elizabeth richmond duplicated harry and ginny earlier trick and managed to stun both their fifth year slytherin opponents in one attack they were only fifth years michael shrugged off any congratulations later i d imagine seventh years would have put up more of a fight besides we just copied harry and ginny idea so we cantreally take the credit well it certainly worked better for you than it did for us ginny said ruefully moving her shoulder experimentally true enough i suppose michael granted cheers anyway for giving us the idea the final tally ended with gryffindor on four wins one loss ravenclaw on three wins two losses hufflepuff on one wins four losses and slytherin on two wins three losses harry felt a little sorry for the hufflepuffs he watched professor sprout comforting her downcast students of which eight had been eliminated in only the first round of duels poor sods ron muttered coming to stand beside harry better them than us though alex commented moving to stand on harry other side still four wins we re not doing too badly are we no i suppose not harry sighed even so he left it hanging i just happy to see the slytherins getting their arses kicked ron said in satisfaction ron hermione scolded him i ve told you this isntabout i know hermione ron interrupted her rolling his eyes in harry direction who smiled faintly i just saying is all yes well in the future dont just say hermione huffed women ron muttered aside to harry and alex hear hear alex chuckled throwing a glance over his shoulder at isabelle who was chatting with ginny using exaggerated arm movements to illustrate whatever point she was trying to make i never know what this one is going to do next you never do mate ron clapped him on the shoulder you never bloody do a n i know there a spelling mistake in there somewhere i just cantfind the bloody thing mutters under his breath about a lack of betaing and this time i promice the next chapter will be out tomorrow really review responses thanks to everyone who reviewed and voted it down to harry or isabelle so keep the votes coming dress without sleeves nice to see i can still make people break their own rules p you ve just been promoted to one of my favourite reviewers you know that it took me a solid ten minutes to stop laughing when i got that review i seriously considered deleting it but i figured i d leave it up for the entertainment value now if they d left an e mail address they d probably get a very long dissertation on the psychological reasons harry is in fact very unlikely to notice an feelings for ginny meaning that as the book is from his point of view as pointed out by mr mrs anonymous they wontbe in the books until he realises he has them whoops sorry didntmean to yell at you but the amount of people who understand the human psyche not at all and then make an idiot of themselves by making comments like that well it rather amusing to say the least and harry has plenty of reasons to fall for ginny if mr mrs anonymous actually read the books they d see that the number of hints and clues is staggering hence the reason h g is the single most popular ship in hp fanfiction erm whoops i rambling again arenti sorry and you might want to get the poor cat looked at falling out a window cantbe a good thing oh yes there is a reason cass is still single but you ll have to wait to find out what it is cass yeah i have to be the one that suffers while everyone else is off having snogging contests pouts jm hush you whimsical firefly yes i know he doesntusually do that sort of thing but in james case i reckon he d make an exception remember his past it a little more extreme than snape s terris percy coming up soon i assure you probably at christmas stayathomedad i hadntheard that one before i ll have to find a way to work it in somewhere katie i trying to put in a bit of fluff here and there but my muses arentcooperating at the moment they keep demanding more action scenes stupid bloody muses shakes fist shorty now bella how could you suggest such a thing isabelle would never accidentally flatten snape it would be entirely deliberate and he d know it too and of course i can rig it i the author so nya p perenelle a mongoose what the merusa deranged father figure i like that it suits moody as for ares i haventhad much reading time lately but it on my list of things to read discretely bumps it up a few spaces kumorikage keyword yet smirks lion of gryffindor new zealand why in merlin name would you want to go there when australia is so close bluemonkeyman nope ginny good but she not as good as say hermione whoops did i say that out loud mimiham i have to ask did you actually read my response to phoenix of hogwarts or are you just assuming because no offence but if you managed to extrapolate what you were commenting on from what i said i cantreally say much about your intelligence go back and read it again and pay attention this time yes maximillian1 vel bol natha waele klez ulu xun unrealitycheck i never said moody was right magickk erm i not really that much like james although he does have a few of my qualities i just gave him a few of my speech patterns is

faerun just so you know mutters about stupid google searches spoiling fun hmm there is a massive difference between invading someone and protecting yourself and your country think about it texasjeanette as i said to unrealitycheck i never said moody was right larna mandrea why thankee daimen darkstar cheers i ll remember that one harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n told you it would be out today is proud warning this chapter contains some underage drinking we all know it happens we all did it if anyone complains i ll bite their heads off savvy dontgo catatonic on me merusa as the undisputed champions of the day the party in the gryffindor common room was long and loud that night the second round would not take place until wednesday and since there were no classes running tuesday there were few qualms about staying up very late especially when james joined the party and in a rather blatant disregard for his duties as a professor started transfiguring innocent butterbeer into far more potent muggle drinks i not really sure he should be doing that hermione said disapprovingly from where the trio and ginny were sitting as seamus collected a glass of whiskey from the professor much to the irish boy delight ahh shut up hermy alex said as he joined them a glass of bourbon and cola held loosely in his hand he knows when to stop he not going to let anyone get sloshed it just a bit of fun so stop being such a wet blanket he took a sip from his glass besides he only serving to the fifth years and above oh so that makes it alright does it hermione asked acidly chill hermy cassie slid into a seat beside her brother she too held a glass of bourbon you know very well that people would be drinking tonight anyway and wouldntyou rather a responsible adult was present to curb excesses she grinned slyly at the other witch try some she said offering her glass you might even enjoy it i hardly think so hermione said tartly and will you two stop calling me that probably not alex said blandly too much fun cassie agreed snowball chance in hell alex said pleasantly hermione huffed and crossed her arms over her chest harry glanced sideways at ginny who was covering her giggles with a fake cough harry alex offered his glass wanna try some i dunno he said eyeing the glass warily i ll give it a go ron reached out for the glass but a voice from behind them made him freeze and just what do you think you re doing little brother come on charlie ron complained turning to face the second eldest weasley who had just climbed through the portrait hole and was now standing with his arms crossed and an amused look on his face you cantstop me i know what you used to get up to while you were at school charlie held up his hands in surrender fair enough i ll keep your secrets if you ll keep mine deal deal ron grinned he grabbed the glass from alex hand and took a long drink steady on alex laughed that my bourbon you re drinking if you want more go get your own tastes good ron stated as he handed the glass back bourbon charlie shook his head you want to try a real drink from behind his back he produced a large bottle of firewhiskey you ve got to let me try some ron begged harry glanced at ginny and motioned with his head the two of them slipped away as alex and charlie started an argument over whether bourbon or firewhiskey was the better drink alex has no idea what he getting himself into ginny giggled when they were finally in the corridor outside the common room charlie always loved a good argument he even worse than ron is i bet you ten galleons it ll turn into a drinking contest no bet harry grinned i d imagine there will be some monumental headaches by morning so where do you want to go ginny asked after a moment dunno harry shrugged there still a couple of hours before curfew we could go for a walk outside if you want i d love to ginny said warmly they made their way down through the castle and into the entrance hall and from there outside the massive double doors they turned towards the lake walking in silence except for the crunch of snow beneath their feet far to their left almost hidden from view they could see lights on in the greenhouses probably professor sprout tending to her plants full moon ginny broke the silence her eyes fixed on the clear sky yeah harry sighed softly makes me wonder how professor lupin is doing that does take a bit of the shine off ginny agreed they walked on in silence until they reached the beech tree near the lake the same tree that the marauders had been sitting under the day they had tortured snape harry spread his cloak under the branches and they sat side by side he wrapped his arm around ginny and pulled her close i used to go to the top of the hill near the burrow when i was little ginny said in a subdued voice during the full moon there was always enough light for me to see by right at the top there a clearing where i d stop and lay on the grass and just watch the moon for hours she smiled wryly used to drive mum mad although she never really had the heart to scold me harry rested his head on the top of hers when aunt petunia used to lock me in the cupboard under the stairs there was this little window that would catch the moonlight for a little while when it was at the right angle it was the only light i had so i used to sit up and wait for it if i knew it would be a full moon ginny said nothing just tightened her hold on him they sat in silence for quite a while watching the moon rise higher into the sky simply content to be together footsteps crunching in the snow alerted them to another person approaching harry right hand moved to his left wrist where zith was curled once again holding his wand and ginny drew her own from beneath her robes there you two are cassie rounded the trunk of the tree i ve been looking everywhere mcgonagall reckons you need to come inside yeah okay harry nodded pulling ginny to her feet and retrieving his cloak so how alex ginny asked innocently as they started to walk back to the castle cassie laughed completely pissed as you probably well know she said remind me to never get into a drinking contest with your brother at least when firewhiskey is involved i ll make a note of it ginny replied with a smile they met hermione in the entrance hall she was scowling in the general direction of gryffindor tower and didntnotice their approach until cassie tapped her on the shoulder oh you found them good she said absently you alright hermy fine fine hermione waved the older girl away not even noticing the use of her hated nickname cassie shot a pointed look at harry who shrugged how was he supposed to know ginny caught cassie eye and mouthed ron cassie nodded in understanding and rolled her eyes come on we d best get back to gryffindor tower it not long till curfew cassie said taking hold of hermione elbow and leading her up the marble staircase harry and ginny followed sharing an amused look tuesday went by fairly quietly harry staged an impromptu training session for the gryffindors in the room of requirement which alex didntattend owing in the words of his amused twin to a bloody roaring headache charlie who had come to oversee the session seemed vastly amused by this and spent a good ten minutes laughing with cassie about alex lack of drinking ability finally wednesday came and with it the second round of the tournament it wasntuntil the whole school had once again assembled in the great hall that dumbledore announced the terms one on one housemate against housemate he said to the suddenly silent room all entries will have a match against one member of their own house this could be interesting alex remarked as the hall erupted into noise well you didntexpect them to make it easy did you isabelle asked dryly since the gryffindors had the most entries left they went first with hermione up against ginny good luck harry whispered to ginny as she left to take her place in the ring i heard that hermione said over her shoulder harry shrugged apologetically as ginny grinned at him the fight lasted quite a while ginny agility and defensive ability playing off against hermione vast knowledge finally hermione managed to get a stunner past ginny hastily erected shield charm and the youngest weasley fell to the crowd cheers nicely done hermione james praised as the two witches made their way back to gryffindor corner after ginny had been revived by madam pomphrey sorry ginny hermione apologised as they sat harry pulling ginny close ginny waved the apology away it was a duel you were supposed to try your best she said calmly congratulations by the way you were brilliant hermione turned slightly pink at the compliment and ron grinned at his sister from over her shoulder the next match shall be between alexander milton and isabelle lestrange mcgonagall announced looks like we re up alex murmured into his girlfriend ear shall we he extended his hand to her we shall she said swatting his hand away and getting to her feet and may the best of us win oh hell harry heard alex mutter as the two of them made their way to the ring begin mcgonagall voice resounded through the hall and alex was almost immediately forced to duck isabelle opening spell son of a alex swore diving out of the way he raised his head just in time to dodge the reductor curse isabelle had followed up with he leapt to his feet pivoting the top half of his body and levelling his wand commoveo isabelle easily dodged his curse returning with a disarming hex alex blocked it with a shield charm and followed up with a stunner this continued for a while the two of them throwing curses back and forth until alex managed slip a tripping hex through isabelle defences she swore as she tumbled forwards loosing her grip on her wand in the process she half turned in the air landing on her side and rolled back to her feet before alex could move she dove for her wand scooping it up as he sent an impediment jinx at her which she used her momentum to dodge she rolled to her feet again and alex barely had time to flinch before a body bind hit him cleanly in the chest he immediately went rigid and toppled to the ground with a painful thump well i ll be damned he said when isabelle reversed the curse and helped him to his feet nice work why thankyou she said grinning impishly as madam pomphrey bustled over to inspect the two of them after alex and isabelle came harry and ron the outcome was fairly predictable but ron wasntreally sore about it hey it was harry who taught me most of what i know about defence anyway he shrugged as he took his seat beside hermione after the match he was still a bit unsteady after the rather wide range of curses harry had used against him the final gryffindor match was between the two seventh years michael and elizabeth michael was in good form using a few spells that even harry was unfamiliar with and making james whistle in an impressed tone several times but ultimately elizabeth emerged the victor ah well cantwin them all michael shrugged philosophically afterwards not against me you can t elizabeth said with a toss of her head of course michael said in a monotone where ever did i get the idea i could ever hope to defeat you elizabeth just laughed and patted him on the shoulder the day proceeded quickly after that the match between the sole surviving hufflepuffs came next with the victor a seventh year unfamiliar to harry the ravenclaws were next and finally the slytherins harry was amused to see malfoy almost lose his match against one of isabelle old dorm mates much as i used to hate the bitch the ex slytherin muttered under her breath to alex then yelled go jeanette finally it was all over with only ten entries left four gryffindors one hufflepuff two ravenclaws and three slytherins the final round will be on friday so until then i suggest you brush up on your techniques dumbledore announced before he dismissed everyone what that supposed to mean alex muttered to isabelle as the two of them made their way from the hall no idea she shrugged knowing dumbledore though it means he got something probably bizarre in store for us probably alex agreed who knows what he might come up with alex a voice called from behind them they both turned to see cassie hurrying after them come on you re needed she said when she reached them grabbing hold of her brother arm and tugging so hard he almost toppled over fair go he said pulling his arm from her grip what so urgent something private she said with a pointed look at isabelle go alex isabelle said with a sigh i ll see you in the common room later alright fair enough alex said a little dubiously allowing his twin to lead him away isabelle made her way alone up towards gryffindor tower musing idly on what could so urgently require alex attention she barely even noticed the large group of gryffindors mostly from the lower year levels until several of them blocked the corridor isabelle came to a stop raising one eyebrow as she gazed at the apparent leader a stocky fourth year boy standing in the very centre of the corridor do you want to get out of my way shut up slytherin the boy said menacingly or at least he obviously thought so isabelle didntfind him all that worrying we know what you are so why dontyou just go back to your slimy dungeons and let the real gryffindors win although she showed no outward reaction inwardly she was now seething how bloody dare he i see very little reason to listen to the bleating of an unimportant toerag who thinks to gain a reputation by attacking me she said coldly alex milton is my boyfriend you moron of course i wanted him to win but it was a contest so i tried my best and won now get the hell out of my way before i make you you dontscare me snake the leader sneered although several of the other students were shooting nervous looks between themselves i a real gryffindor oh really isabelle eyed him with contempt i wonder how harry would view what you re doing now the boy snarled in anger we know how you ve lied to harry potter and we re going to put a stop to it arentwe guys there was some fairly unenthusiastic murmuring from the other gryffindors something the matter here a voice asked mildly from behind isabelle she turned her head and spotted greg redfield and aaron davis coming down the corridor nothing wrong we re just putting a slimy slytherin in her place the leader puffed out his chest importantly oh aaron asked looking around exaggeratedly funny i dontsee any here were you just practicing for when you met a real one then the younger boy scowled at him her you moron he snarled pointing at isabelle greg walked around isabelle and made some show of inspecting the house crest on the front of her robes nope this looks like the gryffindor crest to me he said after a while maybe you need your eyesight checked hayden we know she really a slytherin spy the boy called hayden proclaimed but the rest of the students were beginning to look doubtful as a member of the quidditch team greg word carried considerable weight in gryffindor house oh really greg raised an eyebrow maybe it might pay to get a clue before you start trying to discredit people idiot she no more a spy than i am so get lost and go annoy someone else of course we could always tell harry you ve been annoying his friends aaron said slyly you do remember what happened to the last person who did that dontyou or do you need a reminder by now hayden was looking decidedly nervous run away foolish one before i really do let my slytherin side out to play isabelle said with a gleam in her eyes she withdrew her wand from under her robes and fingered it idly a wicked smile coming to her lips this isntover slytherin hayden spat then turned tail and ran the rest of the gryffindors followed a few mumbling apologies to isabelle before they left i sure it not she muttered to herself as the last of them rounded a corner at the end of the corridor all right isabelle greg asked concern flitting across his features for the first time i fine she said dismissively thanks for the help though i was getting very close to hexing that smirk right off his face we can call him back if you d like aaron said brightly isabelle laughed tempting as it is we d better not she said with mock regret i d really rather not see slytherin win the house cup this year spoken like a true gryffindor greg grinned clapping her on the back come on we d better get you back to gryffindor tower before something else happens might be an idea yes isabelle agreed allowing the two boys to lead her away a n there now that wasntso bad was it 11 pages i think that one of my longest chapter yet go me review responses merusa yes i did read the remus chapter of course i did it was rather good i thought andfairly in character oh and yes you really do need to stop that james is flattered but his ego is big enough already without you adding to it james i resent that dear lady you continue to do whatever you please oh shut up you weselan you were the only person who caught the spelling mistake cheers b a hplova22 you re right it was deliberate i typed it wrong but apparently word doesnthave any problems with it spelled that way so i left it to see how many people would pick up on it stupid spell checker shotgun it tomorrow told ya msmissprongs unfair heck you couldntget it till you turn 16 here and you d be 21 by the time you had your full licence jeaniebeanie33 really hmm i actually got the names from resident evil a combination of chris redfield and rebecca chambers meh dress without sleeves you know what the really funny thing is mia is still reading although possibly not anymore ahh well i can live with that you really need to go read her response check out the reviews for chapter 53 it in there somewhere i do like the fact that she just called more than half the greater fanfiction community idiots and yes warm and bubbly is good some of those pairings are just so so wrong harry voldemort is just warped seriously although i feel the same about d g so who am i to complain evansk colleges i not sure what our equivalent is unfortunately harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber as it was wont to do the news of isabelle encounter traveled like wildfire through the student body of hogwarts reactions were mixed and the following day alternated between people asking her if she was all right and practically spitting on her if one more stuck up son of a bitch looks down their nose at me i going to start hexing people she muttered darkly to alex after a particularly unpleasant encounter with a group of third year hufflepuffs the only reason they had escaped unscathed was because of the timely intervention of professor sinistra i might just join in alex glared so intensely at a group of approaching ravenclaws that they quailed and dashed up the nearest staircase you d think a war would help everyone get over their differences for once but no they re all too bloody self absorbed to even notice he scowled at the flagstones for a moment i think we d better tell dad about this he said finally he might be able to do something about it i doubt it isabelle said resignedly but allowed him to lead her to james office the professor listened to their story maintaining a stony silence all the while i ll deal with it he said curtly when they had finished ushering them out of his office that was productive isabelle muttered to alex as they made their way back through the halls towards gryffindor tower dontdismiss him too quickly alex cautioned if he says he taking care of it he taking care of it give him some time they rounded a corner to the sight of a furious harry potter charging down the corridor towards them who harry asked isabelle in a tightly controlled voice when he reached her she blinked who what who did it harry voice grew perceptibly louder settle down harry alex said soothingly it okay dad already taking care of it i just got his owl harry said through clenched teeth raising his fist a crumpled piece of parchment was barely visible between his white knuckles oh alex eyes widened in understanding i see thanks dad who did it harry repeated it doesntmatter isabelle sighed i ve been expecting it to crop up at some point i actually surprised it took this long i can take care of myself harry maybe you can harry granted but this is gryffindor we donttreat people like that in this house and certainly not our own he thought a moment i going to mcgonagall he said decisively no isabelle caught his arm as he turned to leave she already not that fond of me she explained if we take this to her she ll think i just trying to cause trouble or something mcgonagall not like that harry objected she fair and if mcgonagall doesntdo anything about it i might just have to take things into my own hands alex added grimly cracking his knuckles dramatically that enough both of you isabelle said sharply and both boys turned to stare at her i can take care of myself thankyou i dontneed you two to protect me so bloody well stop it and with that she turned on her heel and stalked away alex blinked a bewildered look crossing his face i dontthink i ll ever understand her he muttered shaking his head ruefully so that it harry demanded we just leave it at that not bloody likely alex grinned viciously i reckon this is a job for the marauders dontyou harry grinned back i ll find gin you find cass and we ll meet in the room of requirement in fifteen minutes dinner that evening was a fairly quiet affair most of the students were too busy speculating on the following day matches to pay attention to much that was happening around them there were of course exceptions when hayden entered the hall and sat with his friends the stocky fourth year quite obviously suspected nothing harry ginny cassie and alex shared a knowing grin the poor sod would never know what hit him unfortunately isabelle caught the grin what have to done now she glared at alex smacking him in the back of the head with her palm ouch he yelped shying away from the irate ex slytherin nothing why do i not believe you isabelle sighed if you ve done anything stupid the rest of her sentence was cut off by a loud scream from the other end of the gryffindor table hayden had leapt to his feet and was now running around in mad circles desperately trying to extinguish the flames that had replaced his hair most of the hall burst out laughing as he tripped and skidded across the flagstones still yelling hoarsely slowly almost excruciatingly so isabelle turned to face an innocently smiling alex the look dropped when he saw the look of raw fury on her face watch was all he said nodding towards where dumbledore mcgonagall and snape had descended from the staff table to aid the stricken boy a wave of dumbledore wand and the flames detached themselves from hayden head taking with them all traces they had ever been there they rose into the air now burning on nothing and began to form letters about ten feet from the ceiling isabelle lestrange is under the protection of the marauders touch her and suffer the consequences a few seconds later underneath the original lettering blue flames sprang into existence spelling out a second message you d make an excellent goat mister hayden harry was fairly sure he saw dumbledore beard twitch as the second message completed itself the headmaster glanced around the room seemingly searching out the perpetrators but when he was facing harry he gave an almost imperceptible nod of approval isabelle expression of rage had been replaced by one of disbelief as alex watched her carefully ready for any eruption her lips twitched slightly quite suddenly she broke down laughing so hard tears started streaming down her face as mcgonagall led a terrified looking hayden from the great hall nice one ron whispered aside to alex as noise erupted from the hall from what harry could hear most of it seemed centred around who these marauders were harry hid his grin behind his hand i rather thought so alex said modestly glancing sideways at the still laughing isabelle the fire was only an illusion so it didntreally hurt him but it might just teach him keep his fat mouth shut i ll pretend i canthear what you re talking about hermione said from her place next to ron you re supposed to be a prefect ron maybe you should start to act like one she paused a moment even if it was rather amusing and he did deserve it she said with a slight smile why thankyou hermy cassie said brightly hermione turned away muttering to herself ron patted her shoulder comfortingly and flashed cassie a grin alright i admit it isabelle said later when they had retired to the seats before the fire in the common room ron and hermione had disappeared after the meal harry had a feeling he really didntwant to know what they were up to that was pretty good and i d imagine rather effective of course it was alex said loftily it was my idea after all isabelle smiled faintly of course it was only you would think of setting someone hair on fire to teach them a lesson did you see dumbledore reaction to the goat comment ginny laughed i swear he was smiling under his beard handy thing to have i reckon alex mused stroking his chin thoughtfully donteven think it isabelle said flatly but alex started to object isabelle cut him off by leaning over and kissing him no more of that if there a beard to contend with she warned right forget i said anything alex said immediately i ll do that isabelle purred harry cleared his throat loudly and both nearly leapt out of their seats they had clearly forgotten they had an audience moving on harry said managing to keep a straight face what d you reckon they ll do for tomorrow matches i guessing either a grand melee or one on one matches alex shrugged that usually the way they end these things yeah but it dumbledore harry objected which means it could be literally anything i suppose alex frowned not like it matters for us anyway ginny said indicating herself and alex we ve already been eliminated remember i dontfancy going up against hermione isabelle said with a shudder i ve never even heard of half the spells she was using yesterday tell me about it ginny rolled her eyes i the one who was on the receiving end remember at least malfoy is still in which means that chances are one of you will get to pound the little shite alex said with grim satisfaction oh yes isabelle smiled wickedly i very much looking forward to teaching my dear cousin a lesson and i ll be most put out if anyone else gets to him before i do i have every confidence in your malfoy flattening skills alex grinned at her so you should she said loftily in any case i suppose there isntmuch we can do about it now harry said getting to his feet i reckon i ll head up to bed so i ll see you both in the morning yeah later harry alex smirked up at him go get your rest you ll need it if you want to beat this little hellion isabelle smacked him in the back of the head ouch would you stop doing that already g night harry ginny isabelle smiled sweetly at them as the couple stood as had become fairly standard practice ginny had harry invisibility cloak hidden in her school bag and she discretely donned it for the trip up to the boy dorms bloody hell dean nearly tripped over his trunk when ginny head suddenly appeared in the middle of the dorm i wish you d cough or something before you did that but it so much more fun this way ginny smiled at him dean rolled his eyes good naturedly before climbing into bed harry couldnthelp but chuckle it was really quite surprising how well dean seamus and neville had become adjusted to having ginny around they all seemed perfectly willing to take it in stride and none had ever complained about it being unfair they all knew what it was for ron on the other hand while perfectly able to accept his sister presence continued to shoot suspicious looks at harry as if wondering what really went on behind the privacy of the silencing charm around harry bed he really neednthave worried harry mused idly as he opened his trunk and began to rummage through it looking for pajamas nothing untoward had happened yet although if he was honest with himself he had been tempted many times he withdrew an article of clothing from his trunk and stared at it for a good five seconds before he realised what he was holding with a yelp he flicked the knickers across the room just as seamus opened the door and stepped through the irish boy blinked as the frilly things landed on the floor at his feet slowly his gaze traveled upwards to where harry still knelt at the end of his bed wide eyed i d ask but i think i already know seamus said with a sly grin nudging the underwear with his foot blushing furiously harry quickly summoned the offending garment stuffing them back into his trunk and slamming it closed he changed into his pajamas as quickly as he could all the while painfully aware of seamus smirk and dove into bed to find ginny on her back already in her nightdress and her hand pressed tightly over her mouth to stop her giggles i sorry harry she finally gasped raising her head to look at him i came up here earlier and moved some of my stuff into your trunk to save me going back to my dorm every day i hope you dontmind not at all harry said in a strained voice good she smiled impishly at him then you wontmind that i gave all your stuff that didntfit in anymore to dobby she burst out laughing at his incredulous look i kidding everything there you can check if you like a thoughtful look crossed her brow although you really really need to get rid of some of those muggle clothes honestly how you even keep them on is beyond me with a lot of twine harry said dryly well we canthave the boy who lived dressed in dudley bloody dursley cast offs now can we she smiled at him next opportunity we get i taking you shopping mister potter but harry started to object no buts she said adamantly you re going to get some nice clothes if it kills me harry bit back a sigh yes dear good now that all settled she patted the bed beside her why dontyou come over here for a while gladly harry smiled at her moving over until he sat next to her with a well practiced flip he reinforced the silencing charm stopping only to remove his glasses and place them on the bedside table a n argh awkward ending i know still it more or less says what i want it to so i suppose i cantreally complain too much next chapter will be out tomorrow and contains malfoy getting his snotty arse kicked huzzah review responses ps there are spelling mistakes in sc because wf has a bad habit of posting chapters before i get the chance to beta them doubleoducky you ll just have to read and find out now wontyou bibliophile actually my adoptive little sister is from singapore msmissprongs backward okay now i insulted also is pig latin really the best you can do shame on you i ve studied chaucer my dear cleo

completely evil either shades of grey and all that i donthave the rest of 6th year just mapped out i actually have the climax to the story written and according to my beta it some of my best stuff shameless ego flattery i know but hey should only take me about another ten chapters before i get that far if of course my thrice damned muses decide to co operate rosepetal13 glad you re enjoying it i think having likable oc is my crowning achievement there are so few in fanfiction that arenteither self insertion or mary sues i more or less went out of my way to make oc that were real people as jk does introduce new characters every book as for h g relationship theirs is a little deeper than just snogging in broom closets it annoys me when some authors have that as the only way they show affection that just shallow romulus4 there is nothing wrong with bourbon although wild turkey is my preferred poison saerry snape lol i doubt anyone could actually pronounce that ahh well it all good and anytime you need a beta you know where to find me nm is the reason i addicted to fanfiction so i owe you mrssakurapotter you had me worried there for a minute i actually surprised that no one

muahahahaha dress without sleeves you really are weird you know that not that i complaining of course merusa lol i suppose it testament to my character creating abilities if nothing else and yes malfoy gets his arse kicked next chapter squee lourdes yes i know the same laws apply here but they are ignored fairly regularly harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n ahh i really really like this chapter read on you ll see why harry awoke early friday morning feeling refreshed and ready to face the day until he remembered that today was the last day of the tournament it was around about then that a weight settled in the region of his stomach slipping out of bed carefully so as to not wake ginny he crept over to the window from there he could see the grounds and beyond to the forest bathed in a half light from the very small tip of sun that was visible over the hills he watched the scene as the light grew steadily brighter his mind running scenarios for the day to come each more absurd than the last finally as the sun slipped completely above the hills and he heard the sounds of someone waking behind him he mentally shook himself brooding would accomplish nothing and in any case he d find out what dumbledore had up his sleeve soon enough he heard a soft step behind him and half turned to see alex heading his way stifling a yawn with one hand what gryffindor resident hero not able to sleep he asked dryly pouring himself a glass of water from the pitcher on the table under the window harry smiled slightly in response i canthelp but wonder what dumbledore got in store for us he whispered mindful of the four other boys asleep not to mention ginny yeah i kinda know what you mean alex patted him on the shoulder not to worry i fairly sure we ll come out on top so to speak so long as ferret face doesntwin i ll be happy harry couldnthelp but chuckle yeah i dunno if i d like to be him when isabelle gets her hands on him amen to that alex affirmed now if you dontmind i going to stumble off and have a shower dontdrown harry called softly after the dark haired boy as he left the room receiving a negligent wave in response it was rather odd harry decided as he moved to the end of his bed to collect clothes for the day just how quickly alex and cassie had been accepted into the group he found it hard to imagine hogwarts without them both now but they had only arrived a little under four months ago it really was uncanny and harry strongly suspected the prophecy was involved it seemed to be drawing the people it needed together and to hell with the normal rules he briefly wondered if it were possible for a prophecy to have something of an awareness when a soft moan alerted him to the fact that ginny was waking he dressed quickly carefully avoiding the clothes ginny had thrown seemingly at random into his trunk whatever else she was good at it apparently didntinclude neatness when he was done he slipped out the door and headed down the stairs to the common room not long after people began to trickle down from the dorms the first of the group to emerge was cassie smiling warmly as she crossed the common room to where he sat restlessly staring out the window nervous she asked quietly seating herself next to him on the couch a bit yeah harry admitted with a sigh turning away from the window to face her you dontneed to be you know she said comfortably leaning back into the deep cushions and smiling i have a feeling this is all going to come down to you and isabelle and since you re the one that trained her you cantreally lose can you doesntmatter who wins even if it her you still win by proxy harry thought a moment yeah i guess so he said finally it just he left it hanging i know the feeling she assured him dontworry everything will be fine famous last words harry muttered cassie laughed patting him lightly on the shoulder indeed they are my friend so i wontrepeat them all you have to do it get your butt out there and win got it harry couldnthelp but smile at that yeah i got it good she said standing up and hauling him to his feet now since your girlfriend just came down from her dorm and i not even going to bother asking how she managed to sneak from yours to hers i ll scoot and leave you with her she turned to walk away leaving a bemused harry behind oh and harry she said over her shoulder donteven think about going easy on bela she ll get offended and i ve noticed she got a right temper i ll keep that in mind he called as she vanished out the portrait hole ginny reached him not long after rubbing sleep from her eyes and looking curiously after the retreating girl what was that all about she asked curiously harry shook his head ruefully still smiling they re just full of surprises it seems he looked down at ginny and saw confusion in her eyes never mind harry said taking hold of her hand and pulling her towards the portrait hole i starved let eat great now you re sounding like my prat of a brother ginny rolled her eyes playfully as they left the room a few hours later when the whole school was once again assembled in the great hall for the final rounds of the tournament dumbledore finally revealed his grand plan to an eagerly awaiting student body there will be two melee rounds consisting of five students each he announced to the silent hall the winners of each melee will take the floor against each other and the winner of that duel will also be the winner of the tournament the students crowding the stands broke into whispers as alex watched the headmaster re seat himself with one eyebrow raised well that answers that then he said finally yeah i guess so harry replied i suppose our theories were kind of right then i just hope i get put in the melee with malfoy isabelle said with a feral gleam in her dark eyes the first melee match will consist of isabelle lestrange and elizabeth richmond from gryffindor michael corner and luke wernett from ravenclaw and draco malfoy from slytherin i wouldntwant to be ferret right now ron said glaring across the hall at the slytherin in question hit him once for me would you isabelle gladly she said idly rolling her wand between her fingers so that red and green sparks shot from the end she got to her feet and trailed by elizabeth made her way out to the ring do you reckon he stands a chance cassie asked cheekily as they watched the ex slytherin take her place alex snorted hardly he said with contempt the little snot rag wontknow what hit him once she through with him harry only half listened to their conversation he was too busy glaring at michael corner his mind dwelling on the incident at the halloween ball ginny seeing where his gaze rested and guessing what he was thinking snuggled against his shoulder his arm went around her almost automatically as mcgonagall voice resounded around the hall signaling the start of the match isabelle immediately leapt forwards her wand leveled at luke wernett and a hex forming on her lips before the echoes of mcgonagall announcement had even begun to fade the ravenclaw who had immediately assumed malfoy to be the biggest threat and thus gone after him first had a shocked look on his face as the body bind took him cleanly in the back and he fell rigidly to the floor his wand rolling away from his inert form acting on impulse isabelle summoned the downed boy wand and gripped it tightly in her left hand now doubly armed she began firing hexes as fast as she could with her own wand using the other to shield herself and block you ve got to admit she got style alex said proudly as isabelle took down michael corner by leveling both wands at him and firing off twin stunners the dark skinned boy managed to deflect one while the other hit his left arm it didntknock him out but slowed him enough for elizabeth to finish him with an odd curse that seemed to take away control of his muscles michael collapsed in a quivering heap his eyes wide with fear and harry couldnthelp but feel a twinge of satisfaction with the ravenclaws down the two gryffindors turned on malfoy who until now had been only peripherally involved seemingly content to allow the girls to take away some of the competition at michael fall he sprung into action hurling hexes for all he was worth isabelle shielded herself from a particularly nasty curse with her own wand simultaneously leveling her stolen wand at the blond slytherin reducto she yelled and the half strength spell took malfoy in the shoulder while he was distracted by elizabeth hurling him to the ground he recovered quickly firing a body bind at isabelle who deftly blocked it seemingly growing frustrated with his failed attempts to subdue the gryffindors he aimed his wand at the flagstones at elizabeth feet barathrum elizabeth let out an odd surprised squawk as the ground gave way and she slid unceremoniously into the large pit that had opened up in front of her malfoy flicked his wand again and the floor promptly sealed itself over her nice trick dear cousin isabelle called stalking from side to side like a restless lion a fitting description she mused smiling so her teeth showed now i think it time to end this hmm i not going to argue malfoy smirked then leveled his wand commoveo isabelle didnteven flinch as the burst of yellow light shot towards her instead pointing her wand straight up and saying effluo she vanished from sight and the spell continued harmlessly to impact against the shields by this point alex grin was almost splitting his face in two and ron wasntmuch better off as he watched a perplexed malfoy looking around carefully trying to spot the ex slytherin cassie glanced at hermione and rolled her eyes at the pair of them suddenly malfoy froze his eyes darting nervously from side to side isabelle dropped the invisibility spell and they saw she had crept up behind her old housemate and had her wand pressed to the back of his neck you lose cousin she breathed malfoy snarled but wisely remained still this isntover traitorous bitch he said his voice near dripping with hatred big words but can you back them up she asked eyeing the back of his head wishing she could see his expression she had a feeling it would be rather entertaining no i dontthink you can i hold all the cards here and i think it time i prove that to you obsequium to his credit malfoy tried to fight the effects of the spell isabelle stood behind him grimly keeping her wand trained on the back of his head sweat beaded on his forehead and his limbs started to shake violently as his face contorted with the effort he was expending finally his head bowed and his wand dropped from his hand isabelle lestrange wins and goes on to the final round mcgonagall voice was almost drowned out by the cheers of the students isabelle smiled smugly as she left the ring and was enveloped in a bear hug by a jubilant alex when she arrived back at the gryffindor corner ha ha he crowed lifting her from the ground and spinning her around you my dear are absolutely amazing you know that of course i know that isabelle said calmly now would you put me down please alex laughed setting her back down she grinned up at him leaning in to kiss him soundly before breaking away from him and rejoining the rest of the group who were standing a little way back that was bloody brilliant ron said enthusiastically what was that spell you used at the end submission the ex slytherin smirked pretty self explanatory really just proving once and for all which of us is the stronger willed draco always been far too full of himself no arguments here a recently unearthed elizabeth joined the group still shaking dirt out of her long hair you okay michael asked her concern written over his features but elizabeth waved him off i fine or at least i will be after i have a nice long bath she wrinkled her nose congratulations by the way she added to isabelle thanks isabelle nodded you werentso bad yourself until malfoy started rearranging the floor of course the older gryffindor said dryly there is that isabelle agreed with a straight face once madam pomfrey had seen to everyone injuries which were all minor mcgonagall announced the second melee slightly unnecessary as all the students left out of the first one knew who they were the second melee match of the day will be between harry potter and hermione granger of gryffindor joseph bounds of hufflepuff cho chang of ravenclaw and blaise zabini of slytherin harry expression grew grim as he heard the list called out not only would he be up against hermione but also cho he had watched her progress through her previous rounds with mild interest and she had done quite well so far it would be an interesting match of that he was certain he turned to look at hermione nodding slightly when he caught her gaze gently disengaging himself from ginny the two stood good luck both of you isabelle said as harry gave zith to ginny the snake quite content to curl up in her lap harry nodded again in reply not really trusting himself to speak he glanced at hermione who was also looking slightly grim he didntrelish the thought of having to fight her come on harry she said eventually crossing the small space between them we d best get out there he took a deep breath steeling himself for the battle ahead and turned to walk shoulder to shoulder with hermione towards the arena a n muahahaha i love my job truly i do review responses nebulia mind gutter out they re just sleeping in the same bed jeaniebeanie33 boring boring wanders off muttering darkly blinks that it come on people hit the little button in the corner and leave a review you know you want to harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n sorry about the delay but my computer died and took all my files with it i ve had to re write this from scratch still the first version was crap so i not too worried anyway i ve been an evil bastard again and gone a completely different direction to what everyone was expecting arenti nice this particular chapter is dedicated to merusa i was reading her story brethren of ares and it inspired me to get this out so why dontyou all go thank her by reading her stuff and of course leaving reviews full of praise darkness silence ouch harry groaned opening his eyes to find himself once again in surprise surprise the hospital wing dim light filtered down through the high windows indicating it was either early morning or late afternoon his whole body seemed to burn almost as if a million tiny fires had been lit inside him as the icing on the cake he also had a splitting headache he turned his head slightly wincing as he did so to see the blurry form of isabelle sitting in a chair beside his bed her dark eyes watching him intently hey she said softly picking up his glasses from the bedside table and sliding them onto his face how re you feeling what the hell happened harry asked in a hoarse voice where ginny isabelle laughed softly one track mind i see gin just gone down to the kitchens to get something to eat she ll be back shortly she paused a minute well actually ron alex and cassie quite literally dragged her down to the kitchens but the end result is the same harry chuckled and stopped immediately when the movement made his head thump painfully what happened he repeated his earlier question when the pain had died down somewhat isabelle sighed heavily slouching down in her seat you dontremember anything harry thought a moment and came up with a blank the last thing i remember is walking out into the ring with hermione for our match where is she anyway he asked realising her name hadntbeen in the list of people that had taken ginny to the kitchens isabelle eyes raised to look at the bed next to harry s and he turned to follow her gaze the mass of bushy hair immediately identified the bed occupant isabelle harry growled turning back to stare at the ex slytherin what happened you kinda lost it a bit she said finally chewing on her lower lip nervously when blaise zabini the bloody braggart hit you in the back with a reductor curse there was this big explosion almost the crowd was protected by the shields although they almost failed but everyone in the ring was knocked out then you just collapsed is she alright harry asked his voice steady isabelle nodded slowly she fine physically it just madam pomfrey couldntwake them up any of them she gestured to the beds beyond hermione that harry now saw contained the inert forms of blaise zabini cho chang and the hufflepuff seventh year harry was saved from having to comment as the main doors crashed open and a furious ginny stormed in ron i not hungry you bloody great prat she yelled over her shoulder she stopped abruptly when she saw harry watching her a faintly amused look on his face even if you re not mum would kill me if she knew you re not eating properly ron came charging in after her also stopping when he saw harry was awake finally he said wandering over to harry bedside you ve really gotta stop doing this mate ron reaction surprised harry a little he d expected to be yelled at for hurting hermione at the very least that his friend took it so calmly was slightly disconcerting ginny finally started moving again and followed her brother she climbed onto harry bed and wordlessly enfolded him in a hug umm harry glanced up at ron nervously i sorry about hermione and all ahh ron waved the apology away not like you did it deliberately is it but if madam pomfrey cantwake her up harry trailed off not able to continue speaking his worried expression was more than enough ginny squeezed him tighter before letting go and sitting back but you will ron emphasised you always do in the end harry thought the faith ron had in him was a little misplaced but welcome all the same then i d better see what i can do about that he threw the covers back and eased himself into a sitting position aided by ginny you sure you re up for it she asked in a worried tone if madam pomfrey catches you out of bed i have to fix this harry said firmly he swung his legs shakily out of bed and ron moved forward to take his right arm ginny took his left and together they helped him stand i ll go tell dumbledore you re awake shall i isabelle offered without waiting for an answer she left with ron and ginny help harry hobbled over to hermione bedside ignoring the pain that racked his body to the best of his ability he still didntknow what had caused it in the first place not quite sure how to proceed he laid one hand on hermione brow willing her to wake for a long moment nothing happened so much for that idea harry muttered and was just about to withdraw his hand when there was a flash of green light and instantly he felt his pain vanish at the same time hermione eyes shot open and she looked around wildly calming when she realised where she was what happened she asked ron her eyes narrowed as she surveyed the room his reply was cut off as the doors swung open very nicely done harry dumbledore said as he entered the hospital wing his eyes bright and his beard twitching with isabelle trailing along behind you seem to be progressing nicely progressing nicely harry asked in confusion gently shaking ron and ginny off him with the pain gone he could stand easily enough professor i could have killed them but you didn t dumbledore said nodding decisively you merely put them to sleep which makes me believe the integration process is nearly complete integration process indeed harry dumbledore sat on harry abandoned bed flipping his long beard over his shoulder to get it out of the way there is a reason i did not start your training earlier i must say i am impressed most wizards take a full year sometimes two to reach the stage you have in mere months harry didntquite know how to respond to that so i shall speak to professor milton organise an official schedule for you to start your training next term i sure he wontmind giving you some extra tutorial dumbledore stood again his bright blue eyes resting on harry i feel i can say with absolute certainty harry james potter that your parents would have been immensely proud of you right now the headmaster nodded and then swept out of the room harry blinked as the silence in the wake of dumbledore departure grew longer but i didnt do anything he finally protested ginny rolled her eyes nodding to ron they both grabbed a pillow ron from hermione bed and ginny from harry s and proceeded to wallop him with them when harry was finally released from the hospital wing madam pomfrey had insisted on keeping him in overnight just in case he found a school that was annoyingly reminiscent of the previous year when he had been vilified and made to look like an attention seeking braggart every student he passed broke off their conversations to stare at him and began muttering in hushed tones when they thought he was out of earshot hermione who had been released at the same time laid a calming hand on his arm as she saw him scowling at a group of second year slytherins who were opening pointing at him just ignore them was her frequently repeated mantra as they made their way through the castle towards gryffindor tower harry thought she was asking a lot so who actually won the tournament anyway harry asked in an attempt to distract himself hermione glanced over at him a slightly amused smile on her face i was with you in the hospital wing remember oh right come on potter get a bloody grip hermione just laughed and shook her head when they finally reached the seventh floor corridor they were almost bowled over as cassie came hurtling towards them thank god i found you she panted sliding to a stop come on we have an emergency she grabbed harry hands and tugged him towards the fat lady which was wide open harry could vaguely hear shouts coming from within and hurried to follow cassie the scene that greeted them in the common room was complete pandemonium ron and ginny stood in the middle of the room being restrained by alex and isabelle respectively across from them stood hayden his expression smugly triumphant as he addressed the gryffindors who stood around watching the scene unfold you all saw what happened he bellowed his arms spread akimbo does a real gryffindor do that sort of thing did any of the other gryffindors entered in the contest do what he did no it was only slytherin boy potter i going to pound your bloody head in hayden ron growled twisting around to try to get out of alex grip you hayden said spotting harry as he made his way through the crowd you ve got a lot of nerve showing your face here when you re more of a slytherin than she is he spat in isabelle direction her dark eyes stared daggers at him but she didntrelease ginny whose expression was one of pure fury you re full of shit hayden a voice called from the crowd harry thought he recognised aaran voice am i hayden attempted to sneer well then why is it that potter never told us he was supposed to be sorted into slytherin hmm the room filled with mutterings at his words and harry tried as best he could to not take offence and what is wrong slytherin exactly harry asked in a quiet voice which nonetheless succeeded in instantly silencing the entire room they re no different to us except they wear green instead of red what about malfoy another voice called out every house has it bad eggs isabelle answered the question i mean just look at this moron her gaze flicked back to hayden who glared at her says a slytherin what in merlin name is going on here professor mcgonagall entered the common room and immediately silence reigned well she asked impatiently i waiting for an explanation sorry professor hayden said sounding anything but the truth must come out he served harry a glare oh and what truth would that be mister hayden hayden pointed triumphantly at harry that potter should be in the dungeons with the other snakes not here in this tower and so should she he added pointing at isabelle mcgonagall expression turned cold i see she said frostily detention for a week with professor snape mister hayden perhaps it will teach you not to speak of things you know nothing about hayden gaped at her but professor a further two days for talking back mcgonagall snapped and hayden wisely shut his mouth mister potter miss lestrange i d like to see you both in my office in ten minutes she finished curtly then left the room you might have mcgonagall fooled but you dontfool me hayden hissed at harry as the crowd began to disperse i going to prove it i really dontthink anyone going to be very interested in what you have to say after this isabelle said calmly hayden glared at her shut up snake he sad harshly i dontgive a damn what you have to say you ll speak to her with respect or you ll not speak to her at all alex said in a dangerously quiet voice his fists clenched why would i want to show that slytherin whore any respect she just the bitch daughter of a death eater alex let out an enraged roar and leapt at hayden but isabelle grabbed the back of his robes and hauled him back ron hurried over to help her restrain him hiding behind the slytherin skirts how very gryffindor hayden taunted alex cassie rolled her eyes taking a step forward hayden shut up hayden switched his glare to the older girl make me if you insist cassie shrugged before he could react she pulled her arm back and punched him cleanly in the jaw the stocky boy staggered back from the force of the blow his eyes glazed now unless you d like another i suggest you follow my instructions and shut up cassie snapped then spun on her heel and stalked back towards her twin who had been released from ron and isabelle grip and stood grinning at her nicely done he smirked clapping her on the shoulder as the group headed out of the common room away from the scene thanks she smirked back at him then raised one eyebrow at the other five students all of whom were staring at her with their mouths hanging open they d never even seen her raise her voice at anyone much less lose her temper what you just punched that little snot ron managed to get out thank you for that blinding grasp of the obvious ron cassie smiled sweetly at him now we need to find somewhere to go as i d really rather avoid the common room for a while and harry and isabelle have to meeting with our dear head of house she stopped walking as everyone continued to stare at her have i grown another head or something she asked jokingly looking herself over remind me never to get on your bad side isabelle shook her head earning a laugh from the older girl i ll keep it in mind she said an amused smile on her face when harry and isabelle entered mcgonagall office a few minutes later they found not only her sitting behind her desk but james seated next to her the two were holding a tense discussion please sit mcgonagall indicated the two chairs in front of her desk when they had seated themselves she fixed them with a piercing gaze professor milton informs me that there have been problems along these lines in the past she began without preamble yes professor there have been harry nodded keeping his expression carefully neutral why was i not informed that was my decision professor isabelle said reluctantly and why is that miss lestrange i the reason behind all this chaos she said quietly you already dontlike me much i didntwant you to think i was just trying to cause trouble in your house in a slightly uncharacteristic move isabelle lowered her head and stared at the floor i see mcgonagall gazed at the despondent girl for a long moment then sighed my dear child i do not dislike you personally you are now a member of my house and i want you to know that you can bring your problems to me and i shall listen if you do isabelle slowly raised her head an indiscernible look in her dark eyes i she started then swallowed hard thank you professor mcgonagall smiled thinly now would one of you care to explain what that little display in gryffindor tower was all about harry and isabelle exchanged a glance and harry launched into the story behind the stocky fourth year so mister hayden has threatened both miss lestrange and now you mcgonagall summed up when harry had finished speaking i ll ignore your rather unorthodox method of revenge i should have expected no less from the son of james potter but something must be done about this troublemaker i shall have to speak to the headmaster but i believe his actions might be grounds for suspension i d say so yes james spoke for the first time now both of you may go mcgonagall dismissed them harry was about to open the door when she spoke again it will be interesting to see what a new generation of marauders can do although please try to leave the school in one piece harry grinned innocently at her as he followed isabelle out of the room you know i believe the true essence of the marauders is contained within that boy she said to james who raised an eyebrow he has potter leadership black loyal streak and lupin quiet dignity you might be right james said letting out a sigh here hoping he fares better than they did a n come on everyone i have support services now so i know how many people read this and dontreview i had 2 500 hits in the first three days that my total number of reviews please leave a review even if it only to say you hated it reviews feed my muses and make them work

questions asked are answered here somewhere so without further ado this chapter is posted un beta ed because if i delay it any longer i ll probably wake up tomorrow without my head damn those pitchforks mcgonagall pretty much given us leave to declare open season on the little twerp alex said i say we take the opportunity and make an example of him the seven students that had come to be known as the core gryffindors were seated around the fireplace on the day after harry and isabelle meeting with the deputy headmistress which was also the official first day of the holidays it was just after lunch and the common room was nearly empty owing to the fact that the vast majority of students had returned home on the express that morning hermione scowled at alex you cantjust attack a student like that alex why not alex shot back you said yourself that the little snotrag deserves it that doesntmake it right hermione said resolutely ron help me here you re supposed to be a prefect hermione right alex ron said reluctantly much as i hate to say it they do have a point isabelle said thoughtfully if we just start attacking anyone we dontlike how are we any better than malfoy or voldemort for that matter oh great alex crossed his arms sullenly slumping down in his seat spoil all my fun why dontyou we cantjust let him get away with it harry protested there must be something we can do let mcgonagall handle it hermione said immediately she said she was going to dumbledore right so let him be suspended and then he ll just go home spend a month brooding and be even worse when he gets back cassie interjected maybe there something else we can do instead of pranking him why not just completely discredit him then he can say whatever he wants and no one will believe him why the hell didnt i think of that isabelle groaned burying her face in her hands you bloody gryffindors are a bad influence on me you know that but you love us anyway alex wrapped his arms around her and kissed the top of her head dontpush your luck isabelle growled swatting him away so how do we go about discrediting him then harry asked maybe we could feed him some false information ginny said slowly her eyes on the fire that burned merrily in the grate keeping the winter chill at bay then when he tries to use it we jump in and prove he an idiot isabelle finished for her her dark eyes narrowed thoughtfully it needs something more though like what alex looked at her curiously i not sure the ex slytherin frowned there something not quite right about all this it seems to be a little more than a case of house pride is all hayden doesntreally have a reason to be attacking me and certainly not harry i think it might be high time i looked into our little friend history how do you plan to do that ginny asked simple isabelle smirked pray tell enlighten us mere mortals alex nudged her shoulder how exactly are you going to get access to dumbledore files i assuming that what you have in mind isabelle smirk only widened you ll see she promised harry the map would make this a lot easier you re going now no time like the present she shrugged i ll go get it then harry got to his feet and headed for the stairs to his dorm harry and alex loitered casually at the end of the fourth floor corridor that led to the entrance to the headmaster office isabelle had led them here and instructed them to wait for her she had then vanished down another corridor the two boys had exchanged a glance and settled down to wait did anyone tell you what happened at the tournament after you were all knocked out alex asked after a moment harry shook his head i meant to ask but i got a bit distracted funny that alex agreed well when you knocked everyone else in your match out and then fainted yourself dumbledore had to declare you all knocked out isabelle won by default he looked at harry apologetically harry however found he didntfeel jealous of the girl for winning rather he felt proud of her that explains hayden last night harry realised i wondered why he wasntattacking isabelle as much as he normally did but if she just won a hundred and fifty house points he d probably be shouted down alex nodded in agreement there might be something to that maybe he figures you re vulnerable now since most of the school is afraid of you at the moment story of my life at hogwarts harry sighed pensively hermione told me about the chamber of secrets and the triwizard tournament not to mention last year alex gave him a sidelong glance seems like you re always under fire for something or another harry laughed hollowly tell me about it well not to worry alex clapped him on the back i cantsee ron or hermione giving up on you anytime soon cass and i are with you and even if she d never say it isabelle thinks you re the best thing since sliced bread i doubt she d settle for me if she thought she had a chance with you he smiled self depreciatingly you think so do you isabelle voice made them both turn to see her striding down the corridor when she reached them she reached up and slapped the back of alex head ouch what was mmph he was cut off when she grabbed him around the back of the neck and glued her lips to his harry hid his smile and turned away politely when she finally pulled away her dark eyes were sparkling as she looked up at her boyfriend who wore a rather dazed expression and dontyou forget it she nodded then turned to harry come on we d better get back to gryffindor tower i think everyone going to want to hear this with that she turned and walked away dragging alex along behind her harry followed her a bemused smile on his face so hayden senior is a death eater harry sighed they had re joined ron hermione cassie and ginny before the fire in the common room and isabelle had just reported her findings great now i have to be on guard even from my own house explains a lot though ginny said thoughtfully i always thought he was a bit too fanatical about isabelle being resorted how did you get into dumbledore office exactly ron asked suspiciously isabelle rolled her eyes ron do you remember the day we were all inducted into the order yeah but his eyes widened in understanding remembering her metamorphosis oh that brings up a point harry said wryly we probably could have just asked dumbledore for the information now we re in the order isabelle opened her mouth to speak then stopped i never thought of that she said a little sheepishly so how did you get in just because you can turn into a bird doesntautomatically get you access cassie asked curiously easy isabelle shrugged dumbledore leaves a window open for any owls to go in and out she hesitated actually harry i have a confession to make oh when i was still in slytherin i offered my information gathering services to anyone who could pay malfoy employed me several times and one of them was to look into your files that probably how hayden knew about you being almost sorted into slytherin you worked for malfoy ron sounded outraged you have no idea how slytherin house works do you she smiled almost sadly if you have talent in any area you use it to your best advantage the fact that i could offer a unique service for a price guaranteed me immunity she shrugged besides i made quite a bit of money out of it dumbledore never found out so he never tried to stop me i doubt dumbledore wouldntknow harry disagreed the portraits in his office would have seen you and even if they didn t not much slips by fawkes he knew isabelle looked astonished so why did he let me keep doing it then practice cassie said simply she got a point ginny agreed maybe he let you keep doing it so you could get experience i sure it ll come in handy at some point and it just the sort of thing he d do alex laughed delightedly lestrange isabelle lestrange shaken not stirred ron and ginny looked confused but harry hermione and cassie laughed isabelle just looked at him oddly you re comparing me to a middle aged male spy now she shook her head you do wonders for my ego alex well a young talented beautiful female version of said spy maybe alex amended what are you lot on about ron asked his expression baffled alex and cassie exchanged a look then both turned to ron and grinned impishly tell you when you re older they said in unison ron blinked ahh you make it too easy ron you really do cassie said sympathetically patting him on the shoulder are you really sure this is necessary absolutely even if he doesntknow it harry in even more danger now than he has been these last few years i need not remind you this is a very large step what if albus please no what if s i doing this with or without your approval albus dumbledore gazed over his steepled fingers at the determined man sitting opposite him james milton blue eyes flashed fire as he determinedly stared the headmaster down james please understand there nothing to understand i worked for the bastard remember i know how he operates hell last time around i helped him come up with his tactics for crying out loud i know better than anyone should exactly how his mind works he building up to something big i can feel it dumbledore was silent for a long moment then sighed heavily if you really feel it necessary i shall do all within my power to aid you thankyou james nodded curtly there is one stipulation however dumbledore continued miss weasley james frowned are you sure dumbledore nodded gravely very sure all the signs are present but they re so young james objected are you really sure it wise to involve her i do not think we have much choice in the matter i doubt harry would allow us to exclude her that true enough i suppose james sighed tapping his fingertips on the headmaster desk absently what about the other elements if we re going to include her we really need to balance it out dumbledore considered for a moment mister weasley should be suitable for fire i believe and miss granger is eminently suited to air i believe miss lestrange will fit water but i do not know who could represent earth i have a fair idea james shook his head longbottom he involved already and he does fit are you sure if you ask me that again you probably wontlike the consequences james said irritably my kids couldntdo it anyway i ll need their help they re passing familiar with old magic dumbledore let out a low chuckle settling himself more comfortably in his chair very well james i ll let you arrange the details when do you think would be the best time the full moon of aquarius james said firmly dumbledore nodded thoughtfully taking a lemon drop from the tin on his desk and placing it in his mouth the start of february it is a n apologies for the long wait but i ve just recently moved to perth and i ve only just managed to get my internet back up and running i trying to keep writing but things have been a bit hectic these past few weeks fingers crossed that things slow down a smidgen and i can go back to semi regular updates a huge thanks to everyone who reviewed and stuck with me even if real life keeps trying to interfere you all make this worthwhile harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n ducks numerous thrown objects i sorry for the delay i ve been really busy the last few months and i ve had almost no time to write things are easing up now so i at it again this is a nice long one for you all well long by my standards anyway the first week of the holidays passed quickly there were no great emergencies no signs of activity by voldemort and the school itself was near abandoned harry and his friends reveled in the rare silence spending their days outside having snowball fights and their evenings before the fire in the common room talking quietly of anything that came to mind it seemed almost like a time of cleansing a calm before the storm that would inevitably follow and they were all grateful for the brief reprieve to harry immense relief dumbledore informed him that the advanced defense classes would be taken by someone else in the upcoming term as harry would be busy training the headmaster wouldnttell them who would be taking the teaching position but he assured harry that he would approve harry had a few suspicions but decided to wait and see before he said anything christmas eve finally arrived with the usual hype that went along with it james milton quietly withdrew to his rooms as the sky darkened he saw very little to celebrate on this of all days and the general revelry that pervaded the rest of the castle seemed all things considered in very bad taste so he sat before the fire in his study slouching down into his comfortable armchair absently swirling a glass of muggle brandy in his left hand he remained there for quite some time as evening turned to deep night rising only occasionally to refill his glass he probably would have stayed there watching the fire burn ever lower had not a rather unexpected visitor arrived now what could the all powerful james milton the only known mind mage in britain be doing drinking himself into a stupor on this most irritatingly cheerful of nights snape james sighed waving his hand and creating a replica of his own chair get yourself a drink and plant that bony arse down you are not in a position to be familiar with my arse bony or not snape said waspishly but nevertheless he complied with james instructions pouring himself a brandy and settling into the armchair so what brings you to my humble abode sevvie james leveled his gaze at the potion master seemingly unaffected by the fact that he d consumed the better part of a bottle of brandy in the space of a few hours the headmaster sent me snape grimaced he seemed to think you could use some help why the damned fool chose me to give it when i d rather not have anything to do with you at all i ll probably never know ego boosting as always i not here to flatter your ego milton snape snapped his tone softened almost grudgingly albus told me what happened i ll have to speak with him about that james murmured half to himself every time i tell him something in confidence it seems that the whole hogwarts rumour mill has the story the next day the walls in his office have ears snape agreed wryly i ve long suspected those thrice damned portraits are the source james didntanswer his eyes back on the dying fire in the grate the silence began to stretch out until he suddenly spoke why are you really here snape dontsay dumbledore sent you because even if he did you d have refused if you d wanted to snape sighed absently tracing the rim of his glass with one long finger because loathe as i am to say it we need you the only reason the dark lord hasntalready leveled hogwarts is your presence here dumbledore he believes he could manage but between the two of you he left it hanging and yet he chooses to ignore the most powerful person in the castle potter snape snorted derisively i hardly think he worth the dark lord consideration dontunderestimate him severus james said seriously you saw what happened at the tournament and that was only accidentally imagine what he ll be capable of once he learns to focus it he has borrowed power no more snape said dismissively borrowed or no it still his for now at least he at least a match for your precious he of the shite anagrams voldemort and i honestly think he ll defeat him and you know that leaves you in a rather perilous position how so he hates you with a passion james said bluntly you might want to think about that when he defeats old voldie what do you think he going to do he has a very refined code of ethics and i believe he d feel almost obligated to lead the wizarding world out of these dark times he destined for the position of minister mark my words impossible snape snapped the people would never vote for that arrogant little child i think you need to stop seeing harry potter as james potter snape they are not the same much as they look alike harry is neither arrogant nor a child he has all of james best qualities and none of his worst he intensely loyal generous to a fault and he has so much nobility he gives me a headache he is far and away the best hope we have and you d do well to remember that snape said nothing but his expression was set come on snape i thought you were a better man than this granted you re a sadistic twisted arsehole thanks snape said dryly but you can also be a decent person when you want to be i didntthink you were so childish to hold onto a grudge for all these years especially when the target of that grudge is long dead snape sighed again downing the rest of his drink in one go i ll think about it he said shortly do that james recommended then fell silent again the silence stretched out once more but it was not uncomfortable finally snape spoke do you want to talk about it not really james laughed bitterly i d rather go on a rampage and massacre voldemort and every single stinking coward who follows him snape blinked you didntthink i d changed that much did you james raised an eyebrow like it or not there are still vestiges of joseph milter in here he tapped his temple i beginning to see why the dark lord is so worried snape commented he has reason believe me he has every reason were it not for for james trailed off and his jaw set were it not for andrea i would have finished this long ago i doubt it that prophecy is very specific if you d attacked the dark lord you would have failed and probably died in the attempt yes i suppose so james gulped down the last of his brandy and refilled his glass i would have done a hell of a lot of damage before i went down though he said with a slightly feral grin i dontdoubt it snape said dryly james sighed swirling his glass in his left hand and absently watching the firelight reflecting off the liquid it contained i didntwant this snape he said quietly all i asked for was to be left alone with my family lord dickless brought this upon himself when he murdered my wife i will stop at nothing and i mean nothing to get my revenge he slammed his free hand down on the arm of his chair i can understand that snape said blandly dontpatronize me snape james growled a year ago today my wife was raped and murdered before my children eyes that the sort of thing that likely to put me in a very bad mood and is likely to be hazardous to the health of any snarky bastards who are too attached to their own petty grudges to see what right in front of their faces i wasntpatronizing you milton that would be a first merely pointing out that i am fully capable of understanding the drive for revenge i am slytherin after all yes james drained his glass in one go and then in a fit of irritation crushed it to powder you are christmas day dawned to find snow sifting lightly down to cover the turrets of hogwarts in a layer of white watching the scene from a window in gryffindor tower harry and ginny sat snuggled together both holding a mug of hot cocoa courtesy of dobby it looks almost surreal harry said quietly his eyes taking in the snowbound towers of the great castle like something out of a fairytale ginny agreed whimsically playing with the half melted marshmallow floating in her cocoa with one finger loud footsteps resounded down the stairs leading up to the boy dorms and ron and alex burst into view both still dressed in their pajamas and carrying an armful of presents there you are harry ron yelled joyfully depositing a large amount of brightly wrapped parcels into the startled boy lap come on open up it christmas ronald weasley if you dontshut up i going to have to hex you isabelle growled as she entered the common room sandy eyed and surly as usual isabelle they had all noted many times was most definitely not a morning person she had thrown on a green dressing gown over her nightdress and she also carried a pile of presents which she dumped on the rug near the fire cassie and hermione followed wearing dark and light blue dressing gowns respectively in a sudden flash of insight harry realized that their choice in colours was exactly the same as the results of dumbledore light test he wondered idly if it had been accidental or deliberate alex dumped his presents on the floor beside isabelle and dropped down beside them everyone get your butts into gear and start opening presents who died and made you boss cassie grumbled good naturedly slapping her twin lightly on the head as she passed him to sit on his other side harry and ginny shared a look shrugged and dove into their presents the first harry opened contained the obligatory weasley jumper along with some home made mince pies from mrs weasley he remembered the many food hampers from the weasley matriarch he had received over the summer holidays with a smile and made a mental note to send her a thank you note at some point in the not too distant future maroon again ron said in disgust holding the offending garment up honestly she doesntlisten to a word i say just be glad the twins arenthere harry laughed remembering the time gred and forge had forced percy to wear his own jumper and had frog marched him about the common room with his arms pinned to his sides and his glasses askew the next package contained a large amount of rock cakes courtesy of hagrid and a note inviting harry to come down for a visit any time with a guilty start he realized he had not been down to visit hagrid all year with everything else going on in the castle his giant friend had completely slipped his mind well well what have we here cassie asked with narrowed eyes opening a parcel wrapped in a satiny black paper and removing a set of folded black robes she unfolded them with a quick flick and held them up and harry immediately recognized the intricate design on the back it the same he mused pulling his amulet from beneath his robes and gazing at it thoughtfully indeed the design on the back of the robes was identical i ve got one too isabelle reported the card says that it from your father she turned an accusing gaze on alex why are you glaring at me he asked in an injured tone holding up his own set of new robes i ve got no better idea than you we ve all received them hermione said as she and ron also located their black wrapped bundles she took her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and ran it over the material of her new robes a thoughtful expression on her face the tip of her wand glowed with a golden light and she frowned slightly that odd she said to herself we now pause reverently while gryffindor resident genius makes yet another dazzling pronouncement which is doubtless going to leave us all gasping for breath on the floor marveling at her magnificence alex declaimed bowing his head with mock reverence shut up alex isabelle said absently you were saying hermione i cantdivine the nature of the enchantment on the robes hermione said ignoring alex who was now doubled over with tears of mirth streaming down his face i not entirely sure what professor milton has done to them but whatever it is it must have taken a lot of power please hermione james will suffice the professor in question rolled his eyes as he entered the common room via the fat lady there arentany students left here anyway so i think we can dispense with the formalities hmm if you want prof james hermione corrected herself at the last minute excellent james clapped his hands together and the fire in the grate roared up filling the room with warmth i never did like christmas in the northern hemisphere too bloody cold for my liking at least australia had christmas in summer anyway his piercing gaze swept the group before the fire i suppose you re all wondering about the robes then yes the thought had crossed our minds alex said blandly why do i get the feeling you re being devious again cassie added i doing no such thing james sniffed anyway hermione you can set your mind at rest there nothing special about those robes bar a few protective enchantments i wove into them what about this harry demanded indicating the design on the back of his robes what does it mean that one of those things you re going to have to find out for yourself harry james said seriously i not permitted to tell you not permitted by who ron asked james gave a peculiar half smile i also not permitted to tell you that great isabelle grumbled the one professor who actually told us things is keeping secrets wonderful says the girl who been turning herself into a bird in order to sneak into dumbledore office for the last five years james returned urbanely look at it as a challenge it might even be fun finding out for yourself only if you re hermione alex retorted no offence hermy he added quickly will you stop calling me that hermione snapped alex thought a minute no he said finally probably not as amusing as this is james interceded before a fight could get underway i brought a few guests along for the party i certainly home you dontmind mum dad ginny sat up in astonishment as her beaming parents climbed into the common room what re you doing here ron demanded what cantwe want to spend christmas with our children mr weasley said defensively ginny eyes suddenly widened does that mean she was cut off by a very loud crash outside the common room and a second later fred or possibly george popped his head through the open portrait hole it was difficult to tell as he was covered from head to foot in black soot hello all george or fred said cheerfully waving to the rather bemused audience be right with you i ve just got to get fred head unstuck george head disappeared briefly and there was a second loud bang a moment later the twins both entered the common room unlike george fred was not covered in soot but in a fine green powder i think we need to work on that one fred commented aside to george as their mother bustled forward muttering about foolish tricks and casting cleaning charms on both of them thanks mum george said brightly you just watch yourself george weasley mrs weasley pointed her wand at him menacingly i dontwant any mischief this year understood yes mum the twins said in unison another voice came from the corridor outside what all this mess out here a second later charlie appeared in the portrait hole ahh never mind he said when he spotted the twins who wore identically transparent looks of innocence bill sends his apologies he cantmake it he got called back to egypt on short notice well it wasntunexpected i suppose mrs weasley sighed still at least the rest of the family is here she said brightly i think that our cue to leave james said come on you lot dumbledore setting up a meal in the great hall dontbe ridiculous mrs weasley said as alex isabelle cassie harry and hermione made to rise you re all more than welcome to stay this is all well and good ron interjected but you re interrupting the presents that our ickle ronnekins fred cooed as everyone sat obsessed with his presents george went briefly outside and returned with a medium sized sack which from the oddly lumpy shape contained various parcels this was confirmed when fred opened the sack and began tossing presents to people be careful with those george scolded his twin never know what might happen with you throwing them about like that right fred nodded and began gingerly placing each package in front of their increasingly nervous recipients i pity you isabelle said to harry with a chuckle as he carefully picked up the bright orange package turning it this way and that you have one too george said joyfully depositing an identical package in a startled isabelle lap gee thanks she said dryly and here i was thinking i was safe we couldntlet our favourite ex slytherin go without now could we fred grinned at her i the only ex slytherin you know isabelle pointed out yes well just makes the choice easier doesntit george said handing the last two presents to alex and cassie i think i ll open it later preferably from a different room alex said prudently placing the orange wrapped package as far away from himself as possible dontyou trust us fred and george asked identical hurt expressions on their faces alex and cassie shared a look no we don t cassie said pushing her parcel next to her twin with her foot wise decision ginny agreed also placing her present as far from herself as possible fred sighed they donttrust us forge he said mournfully i know gred george laid one hand theatrically across his brow terrible isntit there was a sudden commotion outside the common room and every eye turned to the portrait hole a red haired head appeared from outside sorry i late bill apologised we got held up we charlie asked one eyebrow raised i thought you said you d been called back to egypt i said i had work to do i never mentioned egypt bill shook his head we re just glad you could make it dear mrs weasley smiled at him but who is we ahh that bill head disappeared for a moment and he could be heard speaking to someone outside when he climbed through the portrait hole he was accompanied by another possibly the last person harry had expected to see a n yes i know come on it not that bad a cliffie you all should be able to guess who it is if i started to write the next scene this would never get posted expect the next chapter out much much sooner i aiming to have this finished before hbp comes out so i ll be trying for a chapter a week minimum also dontwaste your time pointing out that elements of the scene between snape and james resembles something out of this means war by the ever brilliant jeconais i ll freely admit that i stole the idea from him sue me review responses since i was so slack in updating for so long i couldnthope to answer everyone cheers to everyone who reviewed though you were the inspiration for me to get back into this fic whimsical firefly you re forgetting she was raised by her muggle aunt remember stelladreams isabelle hair is black and she has dark eyes if you do draw a scene from hpmm would you mind sending me a copy i d love to see it mionegr1000 you d be surprised how many people have asked me that question i male for the record and proud of it slycat blaze11 double checks the number of words and pages of hpmm good grief you read all that in one day i impressed sirusliveson cheers i always get annoyed at fics with no decent oc every hp book so far has introduced at least a few new characters so i tried to follow the same formula you have lupin in poa for example moody in gof tonks in ootp you get the idea if someone cantmake up a decent oc they shouldntbe writing fanfiction it all a part of the job mandrakedm why thankee making harry a mind mage would be rather pointless as he has that power and more at his disposal through his familiar if of course he ever learns to control the blasted thing the relationship between the weasley twins and milton twins is explored in a companion fic i currently working on which should be posted soon i hope as for vegemite mutters about americans who have no taste p iamari matthew hayden is an aussie cricket player i needed a name and had just finished watching the australia pakistan one day series so tadah i have no idea how long every time i think i know my blasted muses spring another plot ferret on me evansk the move is very simply explained really my girlfriend is a perthite nuff said morphmaniac i doubt hayden snr would have disowned his son

isabelle is really not one who would play second fiddle to anyone even harry potter dress without sleeves spleens good grief molly you just keep getting weirder merusa witty banter implies that there were two witty people involved p as to what james is up to he always up to something interesting you ll see harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber hmm i seem to have lost quite a few of my regulars along the way somewhere merusa cq dree joshling hah p shotgunn shorty evansk and anyone else that i ve forgotten where are you all percy ron stared at his estranged brother in astonishment harry noticed the youngest weasley male ears growing steadily redder a sure sign his temper was heating up he glanced around at the rest of the family ginny wore a set expression he d seen many times fred and george looked dubious charlie was openly smiling mrs weasley looked like she didntknow whether to laugh or cry and mr weasley expression was neutral err hello all percy said nervously go on perce bill poked him in the back hard sending him stumbling forward until he righted himself they re your family you silly twit percy glanced over his shoulder at his older brother then swept his gaze about the room helplessly finally it came to rest on harry i sorry harry he said heavily i didntbelieve you when you were brave enough to come forward and tell the truth and i sorry can you ever forgive me every member of the weasley family had their eyes on harry now waiting to see what he d do harry suddenly felt very uncomfortable he knew in a very direct way that he was responsible for percy estrangement from his family he suddenly had an image of percy in the headmaster office the previous year ink splattered all over his nose joyfully informing the minister for magic that he had dumbledore confession on record then the image was superseded by the one he had imagined earlier in his first year percy being frog marched about the common room by the twins in his weasley jumper it not me who has to forgive you percy harry said finally glancing around you didntdo anything to me that countless others haventalready done it your family that deserves an apology not me percy nodded unhappily and turned to his parents mum dad he trailed off then shrugged helplessly i an idiot can you forgive me tears standing out in her eyes mrs weasley rushed forward and embraced her son in a hug of course we can you silly boy she said as percy gratefully wrapped his arms around her welcome back son mr weasley said simply placing one hand on percy shoulder good enough for us the twins said rushing up to percy after their mother finally released him and clapping him on the back so hard his horn rimmed glasses were dislodged and nearly fell off his nose ginny didntsay anything she simply hugged him fiercely when she pulled back she gazed at him for a long moment carefully removed his glasses and slapped him as hard as she could the heavy sound seemed to echo through the common room i deserved that percy winced gingerly touching his stinging cheek yes you did ginny said with a steely glint in her eye just be grateful she didntcurse you ron advised his brother she been training with harry and she getting good i ll keep that in mind percy smiled faintly replacing his glasses so ron you re the only one left what say you charlie hasntsaid anything ron pointed out i forgave him a long while back charlie shrugged it was me who told him to send that letter to harry over the summer so little brother percy suddenly looked nervous as he chewed on his lower lip do i have your forgiveness ron stared at percy hard for a long moment then glanced at harry harry mate what do you think i think it your decision to make not mine harry replied quietly ron sighed heavily running one hand through his hair distractedly i knew you d say that he muttered alright you great prat i suppose i can forgive you thank you percy said simply group hug fred yelled pouncing on an unsuspecting percy george followed pulling ron with him and the four went down in a tangle of long limbs and red hair completely mental bill laughed as fred and george held percy and ron together by the simple expedient of sitting on them i ve missed you two ginny laughed as she pounced on her brothers do you think it was altogether wise bringing those two back to hogwarts james asked aside to molly as bill and charlie grinned at each other and joined the pile of weasley on the floor probably not she sighed watching in somewhat amused resignation as fred and george rolled free of the tangle and started to throw balled up wrapping paper at the milton twins who quickly upended a couch to hide behind and returned fire you four will never grow up will you isabelle sighed she subsequently yelped in surprise as fred and george started to target her instead she dove behind the nearest couch resisting the urge to start swearing from his vantage point alex got a clear view of her face and he suddenly laughed i hope you two have your wills organized he called to the other set of twins of course fred and george chimed good cause you re going to need them in about two seconds fred and george reply was cut off when isabelle suddenly stood from behind her couch holding her own wand in her right hand and surprisingly or perhaps not cassie in her left she aimed both at the twins and said calmly obvolvo the weasley twins had time to glance at each other before the spells hit in an instant both were completely mummified in a thick layer of duct tape they let out muffled cries as they toppled to the floor and the whole room started laughing even molly lips twitched as she fought down a smile all that could be seen of the twins as they rolled on the floor was their bright red hair and their noses there is a lesson to be learned here gentlemen alex said urbanely as he strolled across the room never attack a slytherin especially this one unless you re prepared for retaliation mo vee maverd what was that alex knelt down and removed the tape from around the mouth of the twin that had spoken i said so we gathered you know i think i like them better this way charlie grinned how about we just unwrap their heads and leave the rest of it on as amusing as this is bill interceded dumbledore set a room up for us downstairs so can we move this down there with a quick flick of his wand he removed the layers of tape from the twins spoilsport charlie grumbled good naturedly harry could i have a word harry turned to face mr weasley surprised to be approached by the weasley patriarch of course he answered and the two of them allowed the rest of the group to move ahead of them when hermione the last in the group rounded a corner mr weasley stopped harry with a gentle hand on his shoulder i need to speak to you about ginny he began seriously harry eyes widened almost unnoticeably then narrowed he d expected a talk along these lines sooner or later he d rather hoped however that it would have been later now dumbledore has informed molly and myself of the circumstances surrounding your relationship so i can understand why it necessary i do need to know however that you re going to be responsible with this of course harry said instantly i d never do anything to hurt her or take advantage of her he suddenly had an odd sinking feeling in his stomach arthur weasley was a man he certainly didntwant to be on the bad side of being ginny father and he found himself desperately wanting the man approval he waited apprehensively almost fearing what the response to his heartfelt statement would be his fears proved unfounded however when mr weasley clapped harry on the shoulder good man in that case and i ll hold you to your word by the way i have no issues with you dating ginny he smiled a bit indulgently you have my blessings harry and also my sincere wish that you are both extraordinarily happy with whatever events lay ahead for you thank you mr weasley harry said sincerely a wave of relief washing through him mr weasley chuckled harry my boy call me arthur i not going to call you mister potter so i see no need for you to call me mister weasley all the time thank you arthur harry smiled the pleasure is mine i can assure you arthur beamed i can think of no better match for ginny than you now we d best catch up with the others before the twins completely destroy everything fred and george or alex and cassie both arthur said wryly molly and i spent some time at grimmauld place with james and his children after you left last christmas they re almost as bad as fred and george they stayed at grimmauld place harry asked curiously this was news to him arthur nodded after james house in australia was raided by death eaters he relocated to england to work for dumbledore who gave him the provisional position of defense professor this year looking forward to the removal of that umbridge woman i sure he had nowhere to stay so sirius offered them sanctuary at his house until they managed to find a place of their own the milton twins spent quite a bit of time with my twins they even worked at weasley wizard wheezes for a time to earn a bit of money on the side i never knew that harry said quietly sobered slightly by the thought of his godfather dumbledore had collected the black dog that now housed his consciousness some weeks ago and harry had not seen hide nor hair of him since the headmaster had said it was necessary and harry had decided to trust him but he was beginning to worry as harry and arthur neared the room dumbledore had set up for them hermione suddenly bolted out the door and sprinted down the corridor towards them harry she gasped out of breath after her mad dash come on you have to see this she grabbed his arm and tugged hard almost pulling him over in his haste harry stumbled after her wondering what on earth had her so worked up as they entered the room harry suddenly stopped his eyes wide the room was a fair size as large as a fair sized classroom and a long table ran down the middle of it a fire burned merrily in the fireplace doing it best to stave off the winter chill a large decorated tree stood in one corner and several as yet unopened presents rested underneath seated on the back of an oversized lounge chair by the fire sending a calm gaze around the room was a large royal blue phoenix harry blinked ah mister potter there you are the phoenix said in clipped english i ve been waiting a long time for this moment you have harry natural curiosity overcame his amazement and he edged closer to the bird indeed the magnificent creature cocked its head slightly and almost seemed to chuckle you ll forgive me if you re not quite what i was expecting from all i d been told i was expecting someone larger i not that short harry objected the phoenix gazed at him quite right you re not forgive me if i seem impolite but i am for the most part unfamiliar with your kind on the other side of the room ron was staring at his best friend with a look of stunned incredulity on his face he leaned closer to ginny is harry having a conversation with that bird he asked in a hoarse whisper all he could hear was the trilling song of the phoenix but harry seemed to be answering it when he spoke seems that way ginny agreed not looking the least bit bothered her last encounter with a phoenix had meant both harry and herself had survived the chamber of secrets and she was curious to see what would come from this one ah harry floundered not entirely sure what he should say why are you here i suppose it might be best to explain myself at that the phoenix nodded a curiously human gesture some time ago i was approached by a man who claimed to be the headmaster of a large wizarding school that school was hogwarts and the man was dumbledore harry finished a thoughtful frown on his face quite the phoenix agreed to make a long story short he told me of a prophecy that had to be fulfilled and of my role within i was skeptical at first i had no real reason to trust the word of a human even one so powerful as albus dumbledore but he eventually convinced me to come to hogwarts to meet the receptacle of the prophecy which would be you yourself but why harry asked confused what role are you supposed to play that i cannot tell you i afraid the phoenix cocked its head to the side studying harry intently you are fit it said finally i agree to the terms your headmaster offered terms harry struggled to keep up with the information the phoenix was giving him what were these terms again you are not permitted to know what you can know however is that you have made a powerful ally today mister potter you have but to call and i will come call how do i do that my name will suffice mister potter simply call my name aloud and i will hear and come to your aid and your name is the phoenix seemed almost to smile i am known by many names but my true name is hermes so saying there was a flash of bright blue fire and the phoenix vanished harry stared at the place the phoenix had been sitting his mind struggling to understand what had just happened the encounter had lasted only a few minutes but it had seemed to raise a few thousand questions which he intended to get answers to harry hermione asked tentatively after a long silence snapping the raven haired boy out of his reverie huh he blinked oh sorry got a bit distracted we noticed isabelle said dryly so what the heck was all that about exactly i not sure harry frowned i need to talk to dumbledore i sure that can wait harry dear mrs weasley said this is supposed to be christmas you can speak with the headmaster later yeah i starving ron announced big surprise fred muttered to his twin at the same instant a mass of food appeared on the table which creaked alarmingly under the sudden weight christmas breakfast is provided the milton twins said together in a monotone fred and george exchanged a mournful look we re being replaced forge fred said placing one hand over his eyes dramatically a n this is the revised version of this chapter as the previous version was very weak in several places i much happier with this one review responses mssrblaze sirius will make his return next chapter doggstarr cheers for the nice comments hopefully this should stave off your withdrawal symptoms p marvinismyidol if i read the books anymore than i already do i d never get anything done the problem is i dontwrite either ron or hermione very well so out of necessity they take a bit of a backseat i trying to bring them in a bit more but it not easy as to your suggestion hmm that could be entertaining evil grin potterbrat none taken tadah why is everyone threatening to kill me for that cliffie it wasnteven a big cliffie and you re perfectly welcome shell that an interesting question as you know you cantapparate inside hogwarts grounds so i assuming they usually go to hogsmeade to learn with the threat of a death eater attack i really cantsee dumbledore authorizing that lourdes nope not abandoned i aiming to have it finished by the time hbp comes out but i cantsee it happening i figured out the other day i have about 30 more chapters to go charmingly holly blinks ahh right where to begin you re supposed to hate hayden that the entire point i made him annoying little shite isnthe just be glad you werentreading through that particular cliffie i left everyone hanging so long i had a mob of pitchfork wielding reviewers laying siege to my house gods i love my work p as for the cake i quite partial to cheesecake actually magickk mean evil bugger wagger you re lucky it you and not someone else who called me that sister dearest tabasco heh cheers jenni it annoys the heck outta me when i read stories with constant spelling mistakes so i try my best to minimize them in here glad you re enjoying it saerry snape that a bit rich you cantaccuse my cliffies of being evil i did read nm almost from the start remember some of those drove me nuts waiting for an update so at least i can return the favour p priestess of dan you d be surprised how often i get that still i suppose it understandable the ratio of guys and girls on this site is something like 10 90 still i thought the name james milamber gave it away apparently not iron spirit thanks although i cantreally take credit for it it a modified version of something from one of jeconais stories dress without sleeves nutter msmissprongs you re as bad as her points upwards larna mandrea aww come on admit it you still love me p harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n for those of you who dontalready know i posted a revised version of chapter 60 the other day i d suggest you read it it much improved over the previous version mostly in the conversation between arthur and harry and the very end thanks to everyone who gave honest criticisms you helped make the chapter much better imho also i have a new beta since creative quill seems to have at least temporarily left the world of fan fiction behind and i know i for one am greatly saddened by one of the finest writers on this site i have been compelled to find someone new three cheers for dress without sleeves of course she just gone away for five weeks with no internet access so it kinda moot for the moment but still of course the obligatory shameless plug she brilliant at everything from the weird and wacky to deeply emotive stuff although mostly one shots anyway go read her stuff i command you go my minions after you ve read this chapter of course harry wasntexactly sure when he dropped off to sleep it seemed to happen in an instant between one breath and the next he had a brief flash of pure darkness before he opened his eyes again only he was no longer sitting in gryffindor tower with the others it was the same room the one he had seen months ago in his dreams at privet drive the distinctly serpentine form of lord voldemort sat on his massive granite throne gazing imperiously at several death eaters gathered in the room we are almost prepared my lord one of them said smoothly a couple of months to refine and counteract anything the old man might come up with and we shall be ready to begin voldemort smiled humourlessly excellent i must applaud your efforts williamson it is nice to finally see some competence among those who serve me several of the other death eaters visibly winced as the one called williamson bowed sinuously i live but to serve you my lord i can only hope your loyalty is contagious voldemort stared pointedly at the assembled black robed men what news on the traitor my lord harry recognised the silky voice of snape as he stepped forward and bowed we have made little progress so far although there are a few leads i am currently investigating harry couldnthelp but be amused at the irony of the traitor being appointed head of the inquiry to locate himself voldemort nodded slowly i have every confidence in your abilities severus do not disappoint the dark lord gestured dismissively and the death eaters left the room make sure malfoy knows what is required of him he said to williamson who alone of the group remained in attendance it will be done my lord the death eater bowed again i shall see to it myself harry blinked as his eyes snapped open revealing not a cold room somewhere in voldemort lair but the welcoming red and gold of the gryffindor common room it was rather late and the younger members of the earlier gathering were taking advantage of the fact that the adults had all retired for the night he was half laying on ginny whose fingers were absently stroking his hair as she talked to charlie no one seemed to have noticed that he had not been awake he debated with himself briefly whether he should say something of his vision but decided against it he would speak with dumbledore first maybe the headmaster would have some information about the plan voldemort was concocting where fred ron asked suddenly looking up from where he d been watching hermione and isabelle talking quietly he was here a minute ago george shrugged for that matter where cassie isabelle narrowed her eyes dunno alex replied with slightly exaggerated casualness bollocks isabelle gave a very un ladylike snort you always know where she is just as she knows where you are now where are they alex and george glanced at each other and both shrugged we have no idea they said in unison do i detect a whiff of collusion percy said with a faint smile just then the fat lady swung outwards and fred and cassie climbed through as they made their way over to the fire harry blinked in surprise the fact that they were together was not all that unusual they could have been out pranking someone what was unusual and drew the attention of everyone in the room was the fact that they were holding hands what cassie asked quizzically as they approached the fire have we suddenly sprouted another head or something she checked herself and fred over zaphod beeblebrox alex said with a grin everyone bar cassie who instead returned the grin turned to stare at him with blank incomprehension i really must introduce you lot to the wonders of douglas adams he said with a sigh so i take it you found the cupboard handy then very fred smirked it was only then that harry noticed cassie lips were looking rather swollen so were fred s for that matter he couldntquite stop the smile from crossing his face ron was spluttering incoherently what but fred as verbose as every ronnikins fred rolled his eyes would you mind sharing what you were up to before ron has a fit hermione asked pointedly cassie and fred glanced at each other you know for a genius she remarkably dense sometimes fred said conversationally i ve noticed that from time to time cassie agreed alex grinned at the bushy haired girl if you cantguess what they were doing then quite obviously dear ronnikins has been sorely neglecting you both hermione and ron turned bright red and harry had to fight down another laugh beside him he clearly felt ginny shaking in silent giggles bill and charlie were grinning openly and even percy was smiling i thought you were going out with angelina ron protested to fred just because i was going out with angelina when i left hogwarts doesntmean i was going to marry her ron fred said coolly but ron spluttered alex rolled his eyes at the redhead ron seriously do you want to be the target of the next six months of pranking shut up while you re still ahead or have a head so are you two an item or what charlie asked an odd twinkle in his eyes oh i think i can put up with him cassie said with exaggerated nonchalance she has her moments fred grinned isntshe too young for you ron tried another tack for some reason he seemed to be rather against the pairing now it was cassie turn to roll her eyes ron you moron i ll be seventeen in february fred is only nineteen in april you know that less than two years but you ll be stuck at hogwarts how are you even going to see each other what is this the spanish inquisition isabelle asked one eyebrow raised leave them alone ron ron threw his hands up in the air fine he crossed his arms across his chest muttering to himself under his breath besides fred said smugly to his younger brother she a great kisser of course i am cassie said loftily i a milton does that mean alex is a great kisser too bill asked a smirk crossing his features oh absolutely isabelle grinned at the eldest weasley linking her arm with alex possessively can we please change the subject ron pleaded harry looked at him quizzically wondering what on earth had him so against the match he afraid they ll start using him for experiments ginny breathed in his ear seeming once again to read his thoughts he seen what they re both capable of and if you put both sets of twins together she left it hanging harry had to wince alright new topic isabelle said as cassie and fred sat the former almost on top of the latter fred didntseem to mind i think it time for another explanation from gryffindor resident super genius what the bloody hell was with that phoenix hermione straightened in her chair and harry immediately recognised the signs of her lecture mode according to legend hermes was the messenger of the greek gods who were actually very early wizards supposedly he was a handsome athletic man who flew through the air with winged sandals and carried a herald staff given to him by zeus the leader of the gods the story might have been twisted along the way somewhere charlie said i ve never seen that sort of phoenix before but i ve read about them unlike normal phoenixes like fawkes the royal phoenix can continue to regenerate itself indefinitely it immortal alex translated charlie nodded supposedly they were all hunted centuries ago apparently their feathers made nearly unbreakable quills this would seem to disprove that theory isabelle said dryly it would make sense for early wizards to use a phoenix as a messenger harry put in thoughtfully they can travel instantaneously to anywhere they want i ve seen fawkes do it it would be much quicker than owls and probably even apparition hermione nodded her agreement so if we re correct this phoenix would have to be at least five thousand years old maybe much more bill let out a long low whistle that an old bird he noted i have to admit i ve seen pictures in old tombs in egypt that might be the same thing they re always of a blue bird with parchment in its talons surrounded by fire i never really took much notice until now so both the egyptians and the greeks used these special phoenixes as messengers harry summed up so why would one appear at hogwarts now hermione shook her head i dontknow you should speak with professor dumbledore the phoenix hermes said it was asked to come by him so he must know maybe it has something to do with this second prophecy harry shrugged non committedly he had so far been unable to draw the prophecy out of james who seemed to be the only one besides dumbledore who knew it there one other thing hermione added the herald staff i mentioned was also called caduceus it was a winged rod that was often depicted with two serpents entwining the shaft representing the primordial elements of order and chaos harry that what on your amulet startled harry withdrew the piece in question and studied it as hermione had said the winged rod caduceus formed the centre of the amulet only it had the basilisk wrapped around the shaft instead of two snakes the twin emerald eyes of the serpent glinted in the firelight yet another question that needed answers you seem to have this thing for attracting weird animals mate ron grinned seemingly over his earlier sullenness first the snake then padfoot and now a bloody phoenix ron dontswear hermione scolded slapping him lightly on the arm snake percy asked apprehensively harry nodded at ginny who rolled up the sleeve of her left arm to show the small bright green snake wrapped tightly around her wrist and lower arm i keep forgetting she there she admitted with a small smile she percy voice shook slightly her name is zith ginny extended her arm so her brothers could get a good look charlie seemed fascinated leaning forward to get a closer look while bill watched interestedly percy pulled back almost unconsciously staring at the serpent wrapped around his sister arm with caution clearly written on his face she wontbite perce ginny rolled her eyes at her brother how do you know because i asked her not to that why silence greeted her remark oops did i forget to mention i a parselmouth how forgetful of me the silence grew almost palpable of all her brothers only ron was unaffected he had been around in the weeks where harry and ginny had chased off all the students flocking to the boy who lived by holding extended conversations in the speech of snakes he had grown used to it fairly quickly gin harry said reprovingly tucking his amulet away stop teasing your brothers secretly he was far happier than he let on the fact that she could joke about her gift was an indication she had come to fully accept it typically it was charlie who recovered first being around dragons all day tended to remove your fear of anything unusual how long have you been able to speak parseltongue gin gin since about last summer ginny lied easily she wasntabout to tell them the real source of her so called gift dunno where it came from hermione eyes widened in shock briefly obviously wondering why she wasnttelling her brothers the truth she shared a quick glance with ron who shrugged almost imperceptibly percy on the other hand had an odd look on his face isntthat about the time you ahh got together with harry ginny eyes narrowed dangerously and just what are you implying percy she asked icily her tone quite plainly said that she hadntentirely forgiven her brother despite the encounter earlier ron also glared at his brother percy looked at her helplessly i just saying gin dontyou think the timing is a bit peculiar you dontknow all the details so butt out ron said bluntly if you hadntbeen out gallivanting around with the ministry you d probably know you dontneed to rub my face in past mistakes ronald percy said stiffly i am fully aware i blundered both of you shut up bill said wearily pinching the bridge of his nose ron stop attacking percy percy butt out if gin says it fine it fine i never thought to ask is she poisonous alex asked harry i have no idea harry admitted i not about to have her bite someone so i can find out one happens to be quite deadly master zith hissed almost proudly it takes but a minute for my venom to still the heart of my target be he man or animal she says she usually kills something in about a minute harry translated that pretty deadly charlie noted zith raised her head and regarded the red head through dull serpentine eyes does this one honestly think one would be sent to be guardian for the light one if one was not equipped to protect him sent sent by who ginny asked curiously one may not say mistress zith shook her head in a peculiar gesture from a snake i hate it when they say that ginny muttered slumping back into her seat fred and george shared a look and both turned to harry translation she said she was sent to protect me but wouldntsay who sent her harry said with a slight frown isabelle scowled more riddles she said sourly what you were expecting them to just come straight out and tell us anything alex snorted that would make things too easy well while this conversation is absolutely fascinating cassie said as she rose to her feet and pulled fred up after her i have some important business to attend to mind if i steal one of your brothers gin go ahead the youngest weasley smirked although why you d settle for one of those prats i ll never know aww she loves me fred pretended to cry as he was dragged through the portrait hole by his new girlfriend i knew it george sobbed throwing himself across the room and hugging ginny tightly harry had the sense to dive out of the way before he was swept up too our ickle sister wuves us george ginny tried to scold her brother but it was somewhat marred by the fact that she was trying very hard not to laugh get off me you great prat harry help me out here oh no harry shook his head i not getting involved traitor ginny pouted as she shoved george away from her bill chuckled as george fell to the floor with a dull thump well i dontknow about you lot but i going to bed we have a big day tomorrow we do harry asked curiously yes we do bill said firmly now everyone off to bed before mum comes down here and starts yelling that caused a scurry from the weasley s bill charlie and george left the common room via the portrait hole destined for the rooms dumbledore had set aside for their use isabelle and hermione climbed the stairs to the girls dorms after saying good night to their boyfriends while harry ginny ron and alex headed up to the boys dorms nice to be able to do this without an invisibility cloak ginny muttered in harry ear as they entered the dorm just be glad mum hasntfound out about this ron said sourly she d have your head you know both of you ginny waved him off airily dumbledore told me that he already told mum about it she wasnthappy but she knows it necessary her eyes hardened besides if she thinks anything is going to stop me she sorely mistaken ron held up his hands in surrender i just saying is all he said placatingly alex nodded approvingly finally ron you re getting the idea ron hurled his pillow across the room at the other boy who simply laughed and threw it back when they were all firmly ensconced in their own beds and ginny had drifted off to sleep harry lay awake for some time reflecting over the odd day he had hardly expected percy appearance or sudden turnaround even if charlie and bill said it had happened some time ago a small part of him remained suspicious but percy had seemed genuine enough and then of course there was the phoenix and the odd dream vision he had thought ginny presence was supposed to block that link evidently this was not entirely the case the one thing that made this one stand out above all the others though was there had been no pain involved at all some hours later he finally drifted off into a restless sleep his mind whirling with questions and no answers in sight a n and finally cassie is paired up i hadntreally intended for that to happen but you ve all been quite insistant that she get with someone so i decided to change things a bit gods can you imagine those two together for that matter can you imagine the weasley and milton twins working together hogwarts doesn tstand a chance review responses marvinismyidol twisted ways of my mind i think i can take that as a compliment worry not i not abandoning hpmm any time soon i ve put too much work into it to stop now compulsivereader sorry i didntanswer your question before sometimes i miss things the elements have nothing to do with the prophecy you ll find out more about that in a few chapters and no the milton are not going to replace gred and forge even they arentthat good things are about to change very drastically for the milton

mandrea i getting quicker kinda dress without sleeves of course it doesn t mcgonagall wasntaround harrypotterfan777777 hermes has one very special task but you ll have to keep reading to find out harry potter and the mind mage by james milamber a n apologies for the exceedingly long wait but i ve just moved again and we ve only just had internet installed on the upside we re now living on 18 acres of aussie bushland score the rest of the holidays went by quickly once the weasleys had left and soon enough the halls were again filled with students harry had questioned the headmaster about his strange encounter christmas day but dumbledore had simply told him that such an offer was made only once and he should not abuse it hermione had immediately gone into research mode spending the vast majority of each day poring over musty old tomes in the library looking for any references to the royal phoenix as charlie had called them classes started once again and harry was glad for the distraction there had still been no word of padfoot although dumbledore assured him again that this was a necessary step of his rehabilitation harry just wished he knew what his godfather was going through it couldnthave been easy to be returned to life stuck as a dog permanently he did have to wonder though why after almost two whole months of being back the headmaster had seen fit to take him away the first lesson of the new year was defense against the dark arts james entered the classroom looking rather distracted and something of it lingered about his eyes as he addressed the class right he said in a no nonsense tone that hushed the near silent room still further the last thing i taught you before the break was how to harness raw magic even if not many of you could do it right away i assuming you ve all been practicing there was a chorus of yes from the class right then today we ll be going more in depth into that and learning a bit about the origins of such magic can anyone besides hermione tell me where raw magic was first employed in everyday use hermione blushed slightly as she lowered her hand from where it had been frantically waving in the air harry shook his head wryly some things never change it was originally used by the ancient greeks blaise zabini supplied james nodded and harry ears perked up hadnthermione said hermes was one of the greek gods he sat forward in his seat and paid close attention to what james was saying he had a feeling he might need the information in the future the original greek wizards and witches set themselves up as gods with the use of raw magic james explained back then magic was much easier to control because there were not as many people around who could tap into it as i sure you all already know what we call magic is just our way of quantifying the elemental forces that govern life itself through the use of certain items and ritual phrases we can harness this power to do our bidding the confused looks shared by most of the class confirmed that they had not in fact been aware of this james assessed their expressions and shrugged not important it might be a bit beyond some of you he said dismissively the point is the less people who actively use magic the easier it is to control it a bit like flying a broom it very easy to keep the same course when you re the only one in the sky but when there are fifty people in the air with you it can be a lot harder they interfere with your flight path get in your way magic is the same which is why in modern times we use wands to help us channel the magic he paused well most of us anyway he amended now to business james clapped his hands together sharply and an illusion appeared in the air in front of him a large white and red cross the knights templar who knows anything about them a group of christian knights that fought the saracens during the crusades hermione answered immediately although she looked slightly puzzled by the abrupt change of topic they were greatly feared for their skill in combat and their dedication to their cause a text book definition if you happen to be a muggle james nodded in actual fact they were a group of wizards who took up the sword to fight in the holy wars it was they who rediscovered the methods the greeks used to harness raw magic which accounts for the battle prowess hermione mentioned it very easy to win a lot of fights in a hurry when your sword weighs next to nothing and your armour is completely impervious he clapped his hands again sharply and the cross vanished it is thanks to their efforts that we have the knowledge of raw magic we have today no one knows exactly where they found that knowledge some speculate it was buried in a crypt under jerusalem although how on earth it got to jerusalem from ancient greece we ll probably never know the remainder of the lesson was spent taking notes on the various uses of raw magic which also included accidental magic harry remembered with a chuckle the boa constrictor he had inadvertently set free at the zoo he wondered briefly if it had ever made it to brazil next lesson we ll start to go over how to actually use this magic to aid your spells james told the class as the lesson drew to a close dismissed harry a word as the rest of the class filed out harry made his way to the front of the classroom instead we ll start your training tomorrow night seven o clock right here james said without preamble do i need to bring anything harry asked james shook his head just yourself harry nodded and swung his schoolbag onto his shoulder i ll see you tomorrow night then as harry left the classroom he glanced around looking for ron and hermione instead he found a nervous looking blaise zabini leaning against the wall a few feet up the corridor potter blaise said hesitantly can i have a word harry was immediately on his guard just before the holidays blaise had been one of malfoy biggest supporters apparently things had changed the slytherin held himself as if ready to run at an instant notice and harry noticed his hand in his robes where it was quite obviously wrapped around the handle of his wand harry nodded slightly in answer then followed blaise as he headed up the corridor to an empty classroom they both entered and harry closed the door and cast a silencing charm over the room blaise glanced nervously at the door then prudently added a locking charm to the door what all this about zabini harry asked coldly look potter i ll be frank blaise drew in a deep breath and let it out with a sigh i sure you re already aware that my father was a death eater harry blinked this wasntexactly what he was expecting he d also caught the past tense was he was killed over christmas blaise said shortly killed by the dark lord himself why harry watched the slytherin closely his expression was bitter with an intense hatred seething just below the surface the dark lord gave my father a mission my father failed that mission failure is not tolerated within the death eater circles blaise lowered his gaze to the floor why are you telling me this harry asked curiously because potter i want revenge on the bastard that killed my father blaise looked up and harry saw the fire burning within his dark eyes this summer i was supposed to take the dark mark myself there is no way in hell i going to do that now way i figure it you can help me and i can help you you want to take the dark lord down and i want to help you do it no one screws a zabini and gets away with it what makes you think i can help you harry asked carefully blaise snorted dontplay dumb with me potter the dark lord fears you for some reason i might not know why but i do know there something different about you dumbledore wouldntsingle you out so much if there wasn t now do you want my help or not harry didntanswer right away just studied the slytherin sitting opposite him intently blaise matched his gaze not actively hostile but rather fierce and determined come with me harry said finally standing and canceling the spells on the room he left the room and headed down the corridor with blaise following towards the great hall he was in luck he found the person he was looking for as she was about to enter the hall for lunch isabelle harry called and the girl in question stopped and turned sighting harry her expression flickered for an instant when she spotted blaise but she was slytherin enough to keep any outward show of surprise to herself that was exactly why harry had gone to her she was still a slytherin regardless of everything and she knew how their minds worked what is it she asked we need to talk privately of course she nodded lead the way the three of them made their way up to the seventh floor to the room of requirement isabelle kept blaise back around the corner while harry went ahead and opened the room when all three were inside the replica of the gryffindor common room harry had blaise repeat his story isabelle was frowning by the time her ex housemate had finished you say your father failed a mission can you tell us what that mission was blaise seemed to fight internally for a few seconds obvious dislike for isabelle written on his features when he answered it was grudgingly i dontknow he admitted i only know it had something to do with gringotts makes sense isabelle mused if voldemort can gain control of gringotts he d control most of the money in the wizarding world at that point i d imagine most of the official resistance against him would collapse blaise shrugged i suppose so he said indifferently so potter now that your tame little slytherin he curled his lip mockingly has given me the once over are you going to let me help or not isabelle harry looked at her inquiringly ignoring blaise tone his story is genuine as far as it went she shrugged it in keeping with the way voldemort operates and my contacts in slytherin told me this morning that the zabini name had fallen into disfavour whether he can be trusted she trailed off and shrugged it your call harry i knew you were going to say that he grumbled he gazed thoughtfully at blaise what are you going to do get revenge blaise said flatly we gathered that isabelle said patiently how did you intend to do that exactly any way i can i disappointed in you zabini isabelle said mockingly a slytherin with no plan shame on you blaise scowled at her i donthave to put up with your shit lestrange he said coolly if you want the help of a slytherin well placed to pass on information smuggle materials into the castle or out if you need it then you can have it if not then stop wasting my time isabelle smirked firstly zabini remember that you came to us secondly we can already do all of those things and far more reliably than you can now do you have anything of value to add or shall we leave isabelle harry said reprovingly he wants to help that all sure he does she muttered but fell silent look blaise harry started it not like i wouldntappreciate any help i can get but there are risks for one it was hard enough for the other gryffindors to accept isabelle never mind someone who has openly associated with malfoy for years ron especially wouldntbe happy we d have to keep any agreement a complete secret am i supposed to care what weasel thinks blaise sneered harry scowled at the slytherin boy that exactly what i mean sorry blaise but my answer is no i not going to risk everything on the chance you might actually hold to your word fine blaise said shortly standing and walking swiftly for the door a second later and he was gone harry and isabelle shared a glance and the latter smiled wryly that went well she said i dunno harry sighed standing and beginning to pace did something about him seem off or is it just me when isabelle nodded to confirm he went on i believe his story about his father but i dontthink that why he came to me perhaps he trying to prove he worthier than his father by infiltrating the order when everyone else has failed isabelle hazarded a guess could be harry granted i think you d better keep an eye on him he hesitated a moment something was telling him to tell her about the vision he d had over the holidays he d only told dumbledore so far and the headmaster had asked him to keep it to himself he had a distinct feeling that it was relevant to blaise sudden reversal have you ever heard of a death eater called williamson he asked isabelle brow creased into a frown it rings a bell she admitted i cantquite place the name though seems to me i heard malfoy talking about someone with that name once he was bragging as i recall when is he not harry said dryly isabelle flashed him a grin i think he was one of the death eaters that escaped azkaban with the imperious plea she said thoughtfully why do you ask oh no reason harry said with slightly exaggerated casualness come on we d better get to the great hall if we want anything to eat harry james potter isabelle said flatly standing and placing both hands on her hips i am far from stupid you know what arentyou telling me harry winced he should have known it was silly to try to hide anything from her of all people i had a vision over the holidays i saw voldemort talking to a death eater called williamson saying something about him being competent and dumbledore told you to keep it quiet isabelle said flatly at his reluctant nod she threw her hands up in the air more bloody secrets for the love of god does it ever end they were talking about being almost prepared for something harry added and that they needed more time to make sure dumbledore couldntinterfere i dontthink dumbledore wanted it made public that he knew about it so they donttake even more precautions or something which is fair enough but how in merlin bloody name are we supposed to be ready for whatever it is if he sits on the warning isabelle answered crossly harry held up his hands to pacify the irate ex slytherin dontask me it was dumbledore idea he said hastily harry harry are you in there oh hi isabelle ginny stopped abruptly as she noticed the expression on the dark haired girl face what alex done now isabelle gave her a startled look and then laughed nothing i aware of she said with a smile in that case he waiting in the great hall for you i d better go down then she nodded at harry and quickly left the room what was that all about ginny asked harry worming her way into his arms nothing important harry shook his head just something ginny gazed at him levelly that is a singularly unenlightening response mister potter she said flatly just a little problem with a slytherin harry said carefully nothing isabelle canthandle ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically obviously not believing him but she let it slide in that case are you coming down to lunch or not if we hurry we can still get something to eat you haventeaten he asked as they left the room of requirement ginny shook her head snape made me stay behind and clean up in potions she said with distaste sounds like fun harry deadpanned not really she laughed softly she frowned slightly as they made their way down one of the moving staircases to the lower floors he was acting a bit odd though he kept looking at me weirdly like he wanted to say something but couldn t probably trying to figure out the best way to insult you harry snorted maybe ginny expression turned thoughtful i did hear him muttering about professor milton james at one stage maybe he said something to snape we could ask him i suppose harry shrugged not really all that interested in snape odd behaviour as far as he was concerned the dour potions master could go jump off a bridge that afternoon was the first advanced defense class for the new year dumbledore had still not told harry who would be taking the classes in his stead and so it was with as much anticipation as the rest of the students that he headed for the classroom right after lunch a space had been left clear right up the front of the room for harry and his friends and they sank down to sit on some of the numerous bean bags that had mysteriously appeared all over the room by the time the class was due to start fully two thirds of the upper years of hogwarts students were present there was even a fair smattering of slytherins in the group blaise zabini sat staring stonily ahead completely ignoring harry although no one noticed anything odd as indeed there was nothing odd about this at all finally a door on one side of the front of the classroom opened and the new teacher strode in a wide smile on his slightly worn features harry stared at him for a long moment and then a massive grin formed on his face professor lupin hermione gasped in the flesh lupin chuckled obviously amused at the various reactions most of the room was staring at him with shocked expressions now let clear a few things up right now yes i am a werewolf professor dumbledore has invited me here to teach you extra curricular defense material which makes this class completely voluntary anyone who is uncomfortable being taught by me should leave now near the back of the room malfoy stood immediately and headed for the exit ah mister malfoy i am sorry to inform you that prefects are still required to attend these classes lupin said pleasantly stopping the platinum haired slytherin in his tracks with a sharp glare malfoy stalked back to his seat no one else would like to leave lupin asked mildly no one moved excellent in that case we ll start by going over some of last year curriculum just to be safe harry could i have a hand please harry ginny ron hermione isabelle alex and cassie stood and began to help lupin divide the students into their year groups by the end of the lesson using a combination of practical testing and harry and his friend foreknowledge of the students he had separated them not by year level but by ability the weaker and newer students were on the left side of the room gradually getting stronger and more skillful as they moved along to the right now i d like you all to remember what group you are in lupin instructed as the class was coming to a close you will practice with the students in your group and i would like to see you all putting in some effort out of class the more practice you get the more likely you are to be able to protect yourself dismissed as the majority of the students left the room harry stayed behind his friends stood by the door making sure all the students left and then quietly exited ginny was last throwing an indecipherable look harry way when the door finally closed harry enveloped the last marauder in a hug it good to see you professor lupin he said finally pulling away from the bemused older man please harry i have a name when we re in private i d like you to use it but calling you remus sounds odd for some reason harry winced moony then lupin offered indicating that they should head for the great hall with a motion of his hand better harry smiled holding the door open then closing it after himself and lupin i must say it good to be back at hogwarts lupin glanced around the corridor fondly obviously reminiscing i never did feel at home anywhere else i know what you mean harry said softly lupin glanced at him sharply but stayed silent waiting for him to continue i suppose i have the weasley s but even so he left it hanging lupin didntsay anything for a long while but he did wrap his arm about harry shoulders in a fatherly fashion when he finally did speak his voice was even quieter than usual harry i know i can never replace your father or sirius and i certainly have no desire to what i can do however is be here for you now he sighed heavily and harry felt his arm tense about his shoulders i reacted badly to sirius death lupin continued after a moment as they turned a corner and headed down a flight of stairs by now they were walking very slowly and lupin was gazing off into the middle distance i wasntthere for you and i sorry i d like to make that up to you now if i can harry said nothing he didntreally feel the need lupin was in the castle obviously at least partially recovered from the loss of sirius he was back on reasonably good terms with dumbledore james was helping him develop the skills he would need to defeat voldemort once and for all sirius was back although he was still missing for the moment and of course there was ginny somehow everything seemed right again a n and that quite enough of that for those of you who are interested i ve begun re posting an edited version of hpmm in my yahoo group review responses dress without sleeves nutter msmissprongs maybe if you d say something worthwhile i d reply to it p larna mandrea one does one
