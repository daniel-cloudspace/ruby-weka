they belong to jk rowling and this fic is for entertainment purposes only i also dontown the show the bachelor and am not affliated in any way to the creators of the show or abc harry potter was a tall young man living alone in an apartment in england he had just gotten back home after a long walk outside and he sees a light on his answering machine indication he had a message he played it to check for messages hi this is the executive producer of the show the bachelor and we are pleased to announced that you mr harry potter have been selected to be this season the bachelor this season you are also able to pick a female friend of yours to act as a spy for you as well as pretend to be one of the 25 woman contestants on the show we ll be sending you all the information that you need in a couple of days once you have made your decision on who is going to be the spy then let us know so that we can get you set up thanks for your cooperation and congratulations harry potter answering machine bleeped what in hell was that i never even applied harry wondered confused and as if on cue he heard a knock on his room hey harry how are things going for you ron asked cheerfully something really strange has happened harry responded what do you mean did something bad happen ron asked feeling worried because with harry working as an auror he saw a lot of bad things happening around him no ron nothing like that harry answered realizing what ron meant then what is it ron asked relieved listen to this message harry replied simply and played the message for him so what ron asked curiously what do you mean so what i never entered the contest unless you had something to do with it harry asked raising his eyebrow surprised harry now dontget all pissed at me me and some of the guys decided to enter you into the show we didnteven know if you would get picked ron explained ron you know i hate the attention you re supposed to be my best friend why would you ever sign me up for those things harry asked i am your best friend harry i did this for your own good ron answered how do you figure that harry asked exasperated think about it this way it has been quite a few years harry you re 25 you have hardly dated and there have been dozens of women who would have loved to go out with you in our world ron explained they just want to date me because i famous they dontknow me harry explained defensively exactly which is why some of the guys and i decided to apply for you think about it this is a muggle television show and nobody would know who you are you would be just a regular guy and they could get to know you its just what you need to help you just get out there and give it a shot ron explained i dontknow about this this situation is kind of weird and how did you hear about this show harry replied a friend told me about it because he heard a lot about it when he walked out into muggle england and decided to check it out i did too and i got hooked look on the bright side one of those women would be someone that you know and trust you really should give it a shot ron added but it a muggle show ron where am i supposed to say i went to school and what about my job harry asked i didntreally think of that ron replied with a shrug you should have thought of that before you entered me harry responded turning around how were we supposed to know you would actually get picked huh this really is an opportunity of a lifetime think about it 25 beautiful woman competing for your affections it would a dream of mine ron added that part does sound kind of cool but its actually 24 ron one of the woman can be a friend of mine and spy on the other woman for me harry admitted that sounds pretty good they could help you see what they re like when they re not around you you re going to ask hermione right ron asked of course dontknow if she d want to do something like this though harry answered so are you going to do it it ll be great harry i can feel it ron asked excitedly well if i can get hermione to go too then i guess i will try harry answered after a moment of thought great ron said slapping harry on the arm then thought i hope hermione does go because i think harry needs this hermione phone rang and she picked it up and groaned hello hermione its me harry said who me hermione teased with a smile you know who it is harry teased back no i going to hang up now then me hermione responded back okay okay its harry harry answered as he rolled his eyes harry who i cantseem to remember knowing any harrys hermione said pretending to think long and hard harry potter you know one of your best friends harry said playing along oh its you hermione answered in a disappointed tone of voice i had some really important things to tell my best friend but now i think i going to find a new one harry answered back with a grin oooh you dontplay fair mr potter hermione answered back look who talking harry replied with a grin harry what up hermione asked quickly while rolling her eyes well ron apparently signed me up to do the reality show the bachelor harry explained really that git doesnthe know you dontlike that kind of attention hermione replied laughing now that i think about it he does have a point i mean the program is a muggle one so all those woman wouldntknow mean as being famous and maybe they could see me as the person that i am harry went on that part is true but this is muggle program harry there will be a lot of things that you cantsay about yourself hermione added i know but those things could be worked out i mean i could just be more general about certain things like i just went to a boarding school in europe that kind of thing harry answered well you better check and see what ron and the others wrote about you then just to be safe hermione answered practically you re right what would i do without you harry asked well you probably wouldntdo very well would live in like a dump and probably wouldnthave graduated hermione answered you know what to say to hurt a guy dontyou harry asked i do my best hermione answered smiling so do you think i should do this harry asked well if this is what you want to do then i ll support you hermione replied cheerfully even if that wasntexactly how she was feeling i glad you said that because you know how they can get a friend to act as a spy for them well you re the lucky one harry added i not going to go on that show harry it not something i would normally do hermione protested it not something i would normally do either but it sounds fun and it always good to try something new right harry asked okay i did say that but for more important things then this hermione protested this is important hermione its about who i going to spend the rest of my life with harry answered but you know what usually happens in these shows they usually break up and dontlast meeting people like this usually doesntresult in a long lasting relationship hermione added if it doesntlast than fine but isntit worth it to try the right person for me could be there there nothing wrong with giving it a shot is there harry asked no there isn t but why me you could ask ginny or someone else hermione asked because you re my best friend you know me better than anyone else because you re the only one i could possibly trust to help me make the right choice of who i could possibly spend the rest of my life with there is no way i could make the right choice without you do you want me to pick someone that is absolutely wrong for me please hermione harry pleaded hermione groaned this is not fair he knows that i cantsay no to him when he begs fine harry i ll do it but you have to promise me that you will listen to my advice of course you re the best hermione harry responded happily now that he knew his life would be in good hands i know bye hermione replied hanging up what have i got myself into how can i do this i can i tell him to fall in love with someone other than me can i really be there and watch him with all those other girls well granger you re going to find out so how did it go with hermione ron asked anxiously it took some persuading but i knew she would come through she always does harry answered with a smile tbis is going to be so great harry just wait and see ron replied i really hope so ron harry answered the next few days were a whirl wind of activity as he head to pack meet with the producers of the show who gave him all the information and instructions as well as rules they answered all of his questions except for the one he knew that he couldntask wonder what they would think when they found out that he was a wizard but since it was a muggle tv show he knew that he couldntmention it the only comfort that he felt was that he knew that hermione would be there he still hadntseen her for a few days because he had been really busy he was really nervous this was the day he was going to meet the group of woman on the show that could help him find the person he could spend the rest of his life with he really hoped he would find that person he took a deep breath as he saw the limousine that carried the woman arriving a n

bachelor abc does chapter 10 which one do you want to play chloe asked how about the one where we each say something that we have never done and someone who has done the opposite has to take a drink allie suggested that game this would certainly make things interesting sue replied i ve never actually played this game before how does it work hermione asked you haventplayed before dontworry about it pretty easy chloe told her with a smile so we re just going to take a sip of our own drinks right christine asked of course so who wants to start allie asked i will i ve never cheated on a test before sue said after thinking for a couple of minutes everyone turned to see who would take a sip of her drink and saw that jennifer did jennifer when did you cheat chloe asked surprised it definitely isnta big deal i was in the 4th grade and it was just a little math quiz i wasntlike planning to or anything but the answers were right in front of me jennifer explained how did the answers just happen to be in front of you sue asked well i happen to be called out of class during the quiz because the principal had to talk to me so since i always was a good student i was able to stay after class to finish the test and i was able to hand the test in on her desk with the others when i was done because she had to leave the room for a little while i dontknow why and the answer key was just right there on her desk and as i handed in the test i could see it jennifer explained likely story chloe responded it true jennifer answered back with a grin giving chloe a jab in the ribs okay chloe said with a laugh jennifer why dontyou go next allie asked i ve never gone skinny dipping before jennifer replied before looking around her to see who would take a sip of their drink allie and christine both took a sip of their drinks spill sue and hermione responded why dontyou go first allie chloe asked well it was just a dare that one of my friends put me up to a couple of years ago allie explained did the dare involve someone else jennifer asked you know that this game doesntactually involves explanations right allie explained yes but you re the one that wanted everyone to get to know each other chloe answered yes jennifer nobody forced you to explain yourself right allie asked no jennifer replied see if you dontwant to explain then you donthave to alright allie asked sure i mean you guys understand that there are some things that are meant to be private hermione answered with a smile because she couldnt tell them about being a witch or knowing harry before i guess you re right hermione chloe answered after a moment so how about you christine allie asked let just say it was on a weekend getaway with my last boyfriend while i was on tour christine answered with a smile that must have been nice to see him chloe responded with a smile it must have been fun jennifer added oh it was christine responded with a slight smile and a sad look in her eyes i cantbelieve you three haventgone skinny dipping yet we ll have to fix this later on allie replied with a sly smile what do you mean chloe asked well i think that you sue and hermione should be given the chance to go skinny dipping allie responded with a smile how are you going to do that hermione asked just wait and see allie answered with a secretive smile christine why dontyou go next chloe asked sure i ve never saved someone life before christine responded after a thought hermione gulped and took a sip of her drink hermione really when jennifer asked surprised a friend of mine was hurt and i just helped them out hermione answered honestly in a sad tone what was your friend doing allie asked it not something that i want to talk about hermione responded truthfully when did this happen allie tried again seven years ago hermione responded in a calm tone what happened allie pressed on it not something i want to talk about okay hermione answered in a slightly annoyed tone of voice it not like a big secret or something is it allie asked again dont you understand that i dontwant to talk about it hermione asked angrily back off allie you did say no explanations were necessary chloe added what is your problem she already said that she didntwant to talk about it jennifer responded okay but it not like any of you guys werentcurious either allie retorted back maybe so but you were the only one you kept on pressuring her for an answer when she obviously made it clear that she didntwant to answer christine replied thanks guys allie i just dontunderstand why you cantfollow the rules you made up yourself hermione replied look i was trying to help you out allie said how hermione asked while raising her eyebrows well it just seems like it brought back unhappy memories and i hear that talking about it makes you feel better allie responded well thanks for your concern but it wontbe necessary hermione told her look i sorry if i offended you but i really was just trying to help allie answered what is with her weird 180 degree mood change with allie hermione asked herself no problem hermione said with a forced smile i ll go next i ve never had a secret that i couldnttell anyone allie responded sue christine and hermione all took a sip of their drinks really can you tell us anything chloe asked intrigued well since it a secret what do you think hermione asked with a twinkle in her eye well it must be something important if you re still keeping it a secret allie commented nice try allie but i not telling you anything hermione responded how about you two allie asked sue and christine well it not exactly my secret but i still promised that i wouldnt say a word to anybody about it sue answered with a shrug mum the word christine answered you guys are no fun allie commented come on allie if you had a secret you wouldntwant to tell us it either would you chloe asked her i guess you re right but sometimes i think you re holding back on us hermione allie added what do you mean hermione asked well i feel like you dontreally want to get to know us allie replied why would you think that hermione said you keep to yourself a lot and you dontexactly hang out with us a lot allie explained i ve just never been good with people that i dontknow hermione explained but you seem to be really comfortable around harry though allie added i just feel comfortable around him that all where are you going with this hermione asked you and harry just seems really close if i didntknow any better i would have thought that you two were really good friends allie explained that good to know harry and i get along really well hermione answered i dontsee a problem with that chloe piped up i was just wondering if there was anything you wanted to tell us allie asked looking at hermione no there isntand i tired of you pointedly asking me questions look i have a few things that i need to do so i going to head back now i ll see you guys later hermione replied angrily looking at allie but smiling at the rest of the group look what you did allie christine said what allie asked innocently you were bombarding hermione with questions like you were suspecting her of something chloe replied i have some suspicions allie answered do you have any proof sue piped in none that is why i was asking her questions allie admitted but you didnthave to pester her like that when she obviously didnt want to answer chloe replied dont you guys think that she keeping a lot of secrets from us allie asked no and even if she was i sure she has her reasons for it christine answered yeah come on let go chloe said and she left with sue christine and jennifer hermione had returned to the mansion still a little steamed at the way that allie kept on asking her questions she then picked up the phone and dialled harry number hello harry said into the phone hermione smiled at the sound of his voice and said are you free right now come on down he answered see you in a few she replied and hung up hermione put down her bags and grabbed a few items from her room before heading over to where harry was staying harry was waiting patiently for hermione to come on over and tell him what it is that she wanted him to do he was getting more and more nervous about what he would have to do knowing hermione as well as he did he was sure that it would be very interesting a minute later there was a knock on his door and he opened it and saw an angry and upset looking hermione what happened he inquired nothing hermione answered it doesntlook like it want to talk about it it might make you feel better harry asked forming a small pout with his lips hermione smiled and said there this one girl whose been getting on my nerves she been hounding me with questions that i cantexactly answer and i couldnthave made it any clearer that i didntwant to talk about it but she kept on pressuring me to answer them oh i know what you mean there have been so many questions that they can ask us and we cantreally answer them because we canttalk about certain things he responded that is part of it but we were playing this game where we had to say something that we never did and we get to see who has done it she explained oh they must have asked you about that harry replied sadly quickly catching on and he quickly wrapped his arms around her i know that it was a long time ago but the memory is still so clear in my mind hermione murmured in his arms as her mind drifted back to what had happened about seven years ago flashback hermione was looking around at the ongoing battle scanning for any sign of harry or ron at first she didntsee either of them but then she saw a flash of black hair pass by her she went in for a closer look that was when she was sure that it was him she then saw a flash of movement out of the corner of her eye and she turned to see who it was that was when she saw a death eater creeping up behind him harry look behind you hermione cried out when she saw that harry didntnotice the danger that he was in she knew that she had to act quickly she had her wand ready and ran quickly towards harry and pushed him out of the way and managed to produce a shield charm just in time to protect herself when she turned around she noticed that bellatrix was just a few feet away from her wearing a very evil smile on her face i ve been wanting to do this for a while now you little filthy mudblood bellatrix hissed she then raised her wand arm and started the incantation avada hermione could scarcely hear her as all her thoughts began to be jumbled and she saw a light emitting from her wand and before she had time to react she felt herself being pushed away she broke out of her trance as she heard grunts of pain and saw viktor muttering in agony viktor why hermione cried out with tears in her eyes end of flashback hermione it was not your fault it was his choice harry told her in a firm tone yes it is because he was trying to save me she replied between sobs if that is the case then the whole thing is my fault because if i had been more careful you wouldnthave had to save me and then krum wouldnthave been killed he countered it not the same thing and you know it hermione retorted pulling away from his arms how is it different harry inquired it is besides your explanation is based on too many what ifs i mean how are you supposed to know that i would see you being attacked from behind and i sure that other people would have done the same thing that i did for you she explained exactly you had no idea what he was going to do either and i highly doubt that you could have stopped him either even if you did know but the bottom line is that you didntknow so it wasntyour fault he responded i know that you re right about this anyways hermione said with a sigh of course i am and look at it this way he didntdie for nothing we did defeat voldemort after all harry answered with a slight smile no harry you did it she automatically corrected him maybe it was mostly me in the end but i couldnthave done it without you he added drawing her back into his arms because he missed her warmth hermione buried her head into his chest and as she relished this feeling f being in his arms and had to smile he always knew what to say to make me feel better thanks harry hermione murmured no problem feeling better now harry asked yeah it time for you to find out what i want you to do she said brightening up what you re asking me to do must be pretty bad if you re smiling like you are he said jokingly you know that i would never ask you to do anything too horrible hermione told him sternly i know that hermione so what exactly are you asking me to do harry asked okay i think that you have waited long enough all i want you to do is to say whatever i want you to say she told him with a mischievous grin okay but when do you want me to do this he asked carefully tonight which includes your date hermione replied in a nonchalant tone what no you re going to embarrass me in front of them arentyou he exclaimed in an accusing tone look harry i sure that they would appreciate your honesty she answered sweetly i knew it you really do want to embarrass me i dontthink that the producers would be too happy either harry added harry you re going to do this whether you want to or not i promise that i wontembarrass you too much and this gives me a great opportunity to see which girl is the right one for you hermione pleaded with him okay but i only doing this because it you he relented in a begrudging tone thank you she exclaimed happily and gave him a big hug you re welcome but how is this going to work i canthear you from the mansion to where we re going on the date harry inquired after breaking away from the hug harry have you forgotten that i a witch and you re a wizard hermione whispered you re right i didnteven think about doing it that way you donthave to whisper because they canthear us harry answered that is smart maybe that why you were head boy she teased him takes one to know one doesntit head girl he teased her back so in case you re wondering i found this spell that can be used to enchant an object to be somewhat of a microphone but without wires hermione explained so i can hear you speak to me but can you hear me harry asked that the beauty of this spell i can hear and see you perfectly but they canthear me she exclaimed happily so if i talking to you they ll think i talking to myself he asked yep so you d better not talk to me that much or they ll think you re a little crazy hermione replied with a grin i suppose that if they did think that you would be happy about that harry inquired well it ll serve you right for all those times i had to talk to you when you were wearing the invisibility cloak she admitted yeah i guess so i did do that a lot he commented yes and i hated it because people kept on giving me pitiful looks when i was talking to you and i truly never knew if i was actually looking at your face hermione added well i ve never actually noticed that because i think you did a pretty good job harry answered with a smile really hermione asked blushing with a pleased look on her face yeah it was like you could somehow sense where i was he answered with a grin it is extremely unlikely that anyone can develop that kind of sense about someone but it would be nice if i did she answered why harry inquired well it would be nice to know where you were so that i could stop you from doing something stupid hermione replied when did i do something stupid he demanded do i have to list them out for you how about when you were going to save sirius hermione asked i wanted to make sure that he was safe harry answered firmly what about when you were going to the midnight duel with malfoy she asked i was eleven and it was malfoy he defended himself it was still stupid how about when you left you uncle and aunt house in the middle of the night hermione responded okay that was a little stupid harry answered a little bit flushed how about the time she started fine fine you ve made your point how about we get back to the topic at hand he asked pointing toward the enchanted object okay so i guess you want to see how this works huh hermione asked that would be nice harry answered with a grin hermione took out her wand and wordlessly enchanted a small pin and handed it over to him so i just have to pin it on and you and i can hear each other he inquired why dontyou try it out upstairs she told him okay harry nodded quickly and went upstairs can you hear me she asked harry was pretty amazed at the clearness of her voice and responded very loud and clear hermione told you that it would work she answered i never really thought that you couldntdo it he replied but hermione pressed on well you sound really loud and clear to me so i not really sure how other arentable to hear you harry asked why dontyou try it out yourself she asked how and where he inquired you can go and apparate to ron flat and check it out hermione answered in a know it all tone what time is it over in london harry asked well london is about 8 hrs ahead of us so that would make it around 11pm i think he should still be up she answered you dontthink he ll mind if i just pop in unannounced do you he asked of course not you re best friends hermione reminded him with that harry apparated quickly to ron flat and noticed he didnt see his red haired friend harry proceeded to work towards his room and he bumped into someone watch where you re going said a familiar voice i sorry he apologized who are you ron demanded getting is wand ready it me harry answered standing up harry what are you doing here ron asked surprise apparent on his face cant i come and visit you for no reason he asked of course you can but i thought you were doing the show right now and it is strange timing ron explained well you can blame that on hermione harry replied i heard that hermione said knew you would harry shot back in a whisper who are you talking to harry ron asked tell him nobody hermione instructed nobody harry answered with a sigh okay so how the show going ron asked with a shrug not bad harry replied tell him that you have something to tell him hermione said mischievous tone ron there something i want to tell you harry said what ron asked curiously tell him that there has been something that you have been wanting to tell him for quite a long time hermione instructed there something i ve been wanting to tell you for awhile now harry said nervously awaiting hermione next instructions tell him that you think that he the biggest git you have ever met and that if he knew you at all that he shouldnthave signed you up for the bachelor you also should mention that you should have known better considering what happened at the triwizard tournament hermione finished what harry whispered just say it remember you lost hermione replied ron you are the biggest git i have ever met if you knew me at all you wouldnthave signed me up for the bachelor but i should have known that you didntafter what happened at the triwizard tournament harry replied what where is this coming from i thought you were having a good time on the bachelor and the triwizard tournament that happened so many years ago ron exclaimed angrily the truth hurts doesntit harry replied after listening to hermione response i apologised harry and you accepted after everything that happened i cantbelieve you would bring this up again ron shot back it just something that i had to get off of my chest harry answered i sorry you feel that way i canttalk to you right now so just leave ron answered okay harry you can explain now hermione said quickly why dontyou do it it is your fault harry asked because it my flat ron replied quite puzzled okay i coming hermione told harry i wasnttalking to you harry explained quickly who then ron asked hermione harry added how ron asked puzzled let hermione explain it harry answered just as hermione apparated next to him i enchanted this pin for harry so that it would work like a microphone hermione answered a microphone ron asked puzzled i ve explained this to you before ron it a muggle device that records your voice so that the person on the other end can hear you hermione explained quickly okay so what does this have to do with anything ron asked well the things he had just told you were things that i told him to say hermione replied why would you do that ron asked harry harry lost this bet and he wanted to test this out for tonight hermione answered cheerfully what did you lose at ron asked she won paintball harry answered grumpily you mean that game where you shoot others with paint ron asked that the one hermione answered great job hermione ron exclaimed hermione won but only because she cheated harry added i didntcheat i won fair and square hermione answered that what she saids harry murmured to ron ron gave him a knowing look and asked so what exactly did you win harry has to say exactly what i want him to say on his date tonight hermione answered cheerfully is that why you said those things to me ron asked curiously yea it was all her doing harry answered pointing at hermione this time it was me hermione explained so you admit it harry asked if it was me then i ll admit it hermione answered oh harry you re going to be in loads of trouble tonight ron commented hermione promised me that she wouldntdo anything too embarrassing didnt you harry asked hermione dont worry harry i wontdo anything to completely jeopardise your chances with them hermione responded rolling her eyes a n hey guys i thought that i wouldntlet some of you suffer the long wait but i really hope to get more reviews before i post the next chapter the more reviews i get the fast the next chapter will be posted hope you guys enjoy disclaimer i dontown harry potter or abc the bachelor chapter 11 harry sat down anxiously as he waited for his date to begin he had always been nervous before his dates but he was especially nervous today because he didntknow what hermione was going to ask him to talk about with the other women just then the phone rang and harry picked it up and heard dontworry about it so much harry relax because as i told you before i wont do anything too horrible to you hermione said if you were me wouldntyou be worried too he asked maybe just a little but i would at least trust that one of my best friends would know what they are doing she retorted i do trust you but i canthelp but be nervous harry replied dont be so tense you re no fun when you re nervous and i bet that the other girls will think so too hermione advised him i cant relax when you re telling me to relax harry answered fine do you remember the time in third year with neville boggart she asked after a while harry had to laugh at the thought of seeing snape in a dress and replied that was definitely a sight that i wouldntwant to miss you re more relaxed now arentyou hermione asked i am thanks hermione he answered no problem now remember to wear that pin i gave you she reminded i wish that i could forget harry muttered to himself what did you say hermione asked harry quickly sat down to keep himself from sounding nervous and with a big smile answered no hermione just shook her head and smiled that knowing look of hers and added dontworry about forgetting to wear your pin because i will definitely make sure that you will have one to wear i knew i would always be able to count on you he replied with a sigh hermione just laughed and said why dontyou just go on and get ready for your date i ll talk to you later harry replied and hung up hermione was sitting on her bed with a smug smile on her face she walked over to her mirror and looked at her reflection she looked presentable but she found herself wanting to look nice for harry even if he would only see her for a couple of minutes she decided to change her shirt she then after a second thought changed into a skirt and a blue blouse then she quickly brushed her hair and put on some lip gloss she then looked at her watch and smiled and quickly grabbed the extra pin she had enchanted just in case harry pretended to forget his pin then she proceeded to slowly walk down the stairs a few minutes later she heard the doorbell ring and she went to open it when she saw him she gave him a quick hug and asked are you wearing it why dontyou see for yourself harry whispered back hermione just gave him a tiny smile and slipped something into the palm of his hand and then walked up the stairs into her room harry quickly looked into the palm of his hand and saw a folded piece of paper he opened it up and saw her neat handwriting on it and smiled she wrote dontlook so scared harry this is going to be fun and you trust me dontyou of course i do harry said i glad that you do or i would have to knock some sense into you hermione replied with a sly grin i hurt that you would think that i such a terrible friend harry whispered making a sad face dont you even start that mr potter you know exactly what i meant hermione replied back with an amused look on her face harry couldnthelp but smile and answered i do okay so now you re satisfied that i wearing it now arentyou well i knew you werentgoing to back down hermione answered with a little chuckle what so funny harry asked well you ve never backed out of any challenge even if it was stupid or dangerous hermione answered i dont remember any of them being stupid harry retorted back come on the one during first year hermione asked it was malfoy and it wasntstupid because it was about my honor harry answered you could have been killed or expelled and honestly it wasnteven necessary hermione answered back i would have gone if it wasntfor you harry answered well someone had to stop you from doing something stupid hermione responded you ve always been there for me but we werenteven friends then why were you there harry asked i ve told you before i just felt like i knew something about you from reading and i couldntjust stand by and let you do something stupid when i knew about it it didntfeel right hermione answered quickly well i can believe that hermione you always did want to help others harry answered back now remember not to talk to me too much during you date hermione reminded him why harry asked because nobody knows that you re talking to me so they ll think you talking to yourself hermione explained with a sigh oh yeah that was one of the things i was worried about before harry whispered back sheepishly what am i going to do with you hermione teased him you ll be there for me right harry asked of course but you might not always want me around hermione answered mumbling the last part harry caught on and said i ll never be too busy for you hermione remember that i here for you if you ever need me thanks hermione replied in a happier tone i ll talk to you later i think they re coming harry added i know i can hear footsteps outside my door have fun hermione said with a laugh do they sound excited harry asked anxiously you will find out when they come down a little impatient arentwe hermione asked amused a little harry admitted dont be you re a very likeable guy hermione told him well this time it different first o all these are muggle women and i not sure they like me harry answered all women basically want the say personality features in guys the only difference is that they know nothing about magic and they wouldnt about your life before which was what you wanted right hermione asked i do but it also hard because magic is a big part of my life and there are just some things that i canttalk about and i get stuck on topics to discuss harry admitted you have nothing to worry about then if you ever run out of topics to talk about i can help you hermione assured him that right you will be able to help me wontyou harry said and he brightened now there you are you are so much cuter when you smile hermione commented you know i still find it weird that you can see me harry commented well i think that it is a good thing that i can though hermione added why harry asked curiously because if i couldntsee what you were doing i wouldntbe very much help to you would i hermione clarified that true did i tell you i glad you re here harry asked yeah but i always happy to hear that i hope you hold on to that thought later on too hermione teased him harry physically paled hermione just giggled and said they re almost near you so look happy harry took a deep breath and turned his head towards the staircase the ladies came out one at a time in semi formal clothing and gave harry a kiss on the cheek as they reached him rather to go ladies harry asked as he went over to open the door the ladies nodded enthusiastically as the followed him out to the door and into the limousine once inside harry asked so do you have any guesses to where we are going tonight not really sue answered well you didntgive us many hints allie pointed out you note was incredibly broad but if i were to venture a guess would be our location would be down town somewhere christine replied after a though now that a good answer hermione commented to harry harry just smiled what are you smiling at chloe asked curiously i just happy to see all of you harry answered quickly really smooth hermione said watching with a smile harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes hermione saw this and giggled again and decided to save him from looking like an idiot for much longer said harry tell them where you are taking them okay i decided not to keep you in suspense any longer we re not doing anything fancy but we are going into a nice uptown bar where there is a great japanese chef will cook for us and afterwards we can just talk and play a game of pool harry revealed that sounds fun christine replied with a smile i do love japanese food chloe commented allie and sue nodded in agreement harry grin broadened and answered i glad to hear it it would be horrible if any of you hated japanese food it does sound fun harry good choice hermione told him and then after a thought decided to tease him again i mean this place is casual and not that many people are around so it ll be a great place for you do your dare hermione watched harry visually tense up and she had to stifle her giggle are you okay sue asked concerned harry put on a smile and said i fine he whispered to hermione what did you mean by that what did you say sue asked i just said that you have nothing to worry about harry answered you d better be more careful or they re going to think you re talking to yourself hermione warned him teasingly harry wisely chose to heed her advice and decided not to respond let the games begin hermione added to herself with a smile a n sorry for the long wait i hope that you will enjoy the next chapter i will update as soon as there are 5 reviews thanks disclaimer i dontown anything this fic is for entertainment purposes chapter 12 as they entered the club they found that it was a very large and very comfortable place with shimmering lights dangling above the floors were put together in a classic marble black and brown design filled with a couple of pool tables sofas tables and chairs there were also candles on the tables to create a romantic atmosphere harry headed towards the front of the room where the waiter greeted him hello mr potter a young man stated hello it great to meet you harry replied with a gigantic smile i hope that all of you like to eat japanese food the manager said i sure we will chloe responded flashing a dazzling grin to the manager that good to hear we have brought a well known japanese chef over here from japan to cook some of his famous teriyaki noodles and sushi as well as some other specialties the manager added pointing over to the older japanese chef in the white outfit he looked very professional and hermione noticed that his hands contained scars displaying his long hard work and skill as a chef he looks like a great chef i think he looks familiar have you heard of him hermione asked curiously i have no idea harry whispered back softly did you ask me something christine asked i was just wondering if you knew who the chef was harry replied quickly that the world renowned japanese chef ken tsuenko he has won numerous awards and medals in japan christine explained surprised why are you looking at me like that harry asked curiously it just that he was on the news and television screen very often these last couple of years he hard to miss so i was wondering that it kind of strange that you haventheard of him that all christine replied oh that why he seemed familiar i remember mum watching him on the television screen she really would have loved to have a chance to go eat some of his food hermione explained to harry after thinking for about a few moments actually it just that the name sounded familiar but i just never had been that great with japanese names harry explained sheepishly dontworry about it i have never been great with foreign names myself i just knew this name because i ve heard it so many times christine replied reassuringly harry smiled and was about to say something when allie touched his arm and started leading him over to another table are you okay allie asked concerned she is such a faker hermione muttered under her breath what did you say harry asked puzzled hermione brightened after a moment and replied it time to have a little fun tell her what do you mean are you okay what do you mean are you okay harry asked allie allie almost choked on the drink she was sipping and turned and said what do you mean by that you re just looking a little bit sick today so i just wanted to know if you were okay hermione told him quickly with a large smile on her face as she saw her reaction you re just looking a bit sick today so i just wanted to know if you were okay harry repeated with a smile i do i sorry to worry you then but i really feel fine excuse me while i go to the ladies room allie replied flustered for a few seconds i cantbelieve you made me say that harry muttered back i was doing you a favour i dontthink you want her to know what was really going on do you hermione asked no harry answered back harry why dontyou come on over and play some pool with us chloe asked sure harry said with a smile do you know how to play pool hermione asked skeptically i might not be the best player in the world but i can hold my own harry answered back in a whisper well i cantwait to see how well you do then hermione replied with a smile i haventplayed pool for quite a long time so i might not be very good chloe told harry with a smile dontworry i not an expert myself harry told her reassuringly there are just a ton of rules so its hard to become an expert in them what do you want to play 8 ball chloe asked sure if that alright with everyone else harry asked it doesntreally matter to me christine answered while allie nodded sue looked a little apprehensive so harry spoke up just to make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding the rules i will go over them once and they are the ones that we will follow i sure we all have learned variations of the rules from other people sue smiled appreciative at harry and that caused hermione to smile and said that was very observant of you harry to notice that sue wasntfeeling very comfortable i impressed harry smiled widely and continued eight ball is a call shot game played with 15 balls and a cue ball they are numbered 1 through to 15 one player must pocket the balls that are number 1 7 which can be seen as the solid coloured balls and the other player must hit the rest which are in stripes whichever player pockets their group first and then pocket the 8 ball wins the game if the player pockets a ball then they continue until they miss their shot now i just want to know if you guys want to play in teams or one on one against me well i think we should play it round robin style just because there are only 5 of us all together and it would be much more fun allie commented well that sounds fine but how often has everyone played harry asked well to be honest i haventplayed very often or lately but i d say i can stand my ground sue replied i haventplayed in years but i think i can remember how the play christine added with a smile i actually just started to play recently so i have no problems with playing it tournament style chloe added so how well do you play hermione asked harry curiously just wait and see harry murmured to her okay then that means we ll play one on one so who wants to play first harry asked i ll try sue interjected nervously great harry replied with a smile okay so let me see if i remember my feet and shoulders should be the same width apart and i place the cue between these two fingers and my position must be stable right sue asked nervously harry took a look and before he could say anything he heard hermione say tell her that her cue should be out about another inch harry raised his eyebrows in response but told sue just the same so hermione spoke up i doing some research on the game just so i understand it better okay why dontyou start first harry asked so i hitting the striped ones sue inquired sure go on ahead harry replied shrugging his shoulders sue took a deep breath leaned in and aimed the cue to strike the white ball at the center and managed to pocket one of the striped balls great job harry commented thanks sue replied with a flush to her cheeks sue began to look at the setup of the rest of the balls and moved over to the spot where she thought was the easiest for her to pocket another ball she took a deep breath and leaned forward and aimed the white ball in the direct that she wanted to hit she knew that she needed to hit it at an angle to allow the impact of the strike to get the ball to head into the direction of the closest pocket she took the swing and managed to get the ball to land really close to the pocket but it didntgo in that was a tough shot but you did a great job harry commented thanks it your turn sue replied with a smile are you sure you know what you are doing i can help you out hermione added in amused tone of course i do or else i wouldnthave suggested it harry calmed stated back okay but if you need me you know where i am hermione told him with a smile harry looked at the pattern of the balls that were facing him and noted the position of each of the balls and thought of the best strategy for him to take on in order to be able to continue on he was actually a very good billiard player and he smiled as he knew that hermione did not know this he expertly knocked two of his targets into their respected pockets great shot allie replied enthusiastically you obviously played this game before haventyou hermione asked harry just nodded his answer and continued on to his next shot he hit three more balls in the pocket before finally missing you are definitely a very good pool player do you have any advice for beginners sue asked well it does take a lot of practice to be good at this game and where you hit each ball is very important as well as the angle of your swing harry answered so basically we just need to practice christine interjected yes that is basically it but i could always give you guys tips if you want harry answered with a slight smile that would be great i always wanted to learn to play better allie replied with a giant smile hermione watched this while shaking her head that girl will say anything to get to spend more time with harry i will be happy to help out anybody who wants to learn more harry answered smiling at all of the girls why dontyou propose that you will give a free lesson to the person that wins the tournament hermione suggested i would love to help out all of you but there just isntenough time so how about i propose that i will give the person who wins this tournament a free lesson harry added it is true that it would take too much time to help out each and every one of us so i think that it is a great idea christine replied thoughtfully i also think that it a great idea chloe answered with a grin well let finish this game first then allie responded sue then proceeded to knock three more of her target balls into the pocket you definitely improve very quickly harry commented well i always strive to improve myself sue responded with a smile that i think is a very important quality in life harry answered with admiration i have always had to work really hard to get to where i am so i have learned to be a very quick study sue answered before she finally missed putting the target into the pocket that was a very great run harry complimented sue thanks sue responded brightly hermione was watching this scene with a slight smile on her face but she felt a slight twinge of jealously which she quickly shook off before deciding to ask the question that has been on her mind for the last few minutes when did you learn to play pool excuse yourself by asking to go to the rest room excuse me for a second i need to use the rest room harry excused himself that wasnttoo hard now was it hermione asked giggling but guys dontuse the term rest room harry said slightly embarrassed well i thought that it would be less awkward then if you said that you needed to use the powder room hermione responded gleefully you wouldntask me to say that would you harry said physically paling then stop complaining it not an embarrassing word and please answer my question hermione told him i have been playing for a few years now i actually just stumbled upon this game once while i was working undercover and i found my way to this muggle bar and the person i was assigned to watch was playing this game and he asked me if i wanted to play and i did and i didntdo so well but he apparently liked my form and asked me if i wanted to meet him again another time after i had some time to practice so i couldntgive up this opportunity and i learned how to play pretty well harry explained so all those times that you said hermione began i was practicing playing pool harry finished for her you should have told me and i could have learned with you hermione answered you want to learn how to play harry inquired surprised yes i do is it that surprising a lot of people know how to play this kind of game so i wouldnthave thought that it would seem so strange to you that i wanted to play hermione explained i would love to teach you the basics of this game harry said with a grin you would hermione asked of course i would it would it would be a great honour to be able to teach you anything harry said in a teasing tone i know that you re just trying to bait me with that comment so i going to take it as a compliment hermione responded with a slight shake in the head you re no fun harry commented what is that supposed to mean hermione prompted him it means exactly what i say why didntyou just humor me with a response harry asked so you rather that instead of making no comment that i bite your ass off hermione asked with surprise in her voice not when you mention it like that harry commented looking slightly flushed that what i thought i think you should head back or else they will think you have a strange bladder problem hermione said looking at the time while laughing i think you re having a bit too much fun with this and dontyou think that the others will wonder why you are laughing harry inquired dontyou ever listen to what i tell you i put at sound blocking charm around this room so they canthear anything that i saying to you hermione replied in a exasperated tone of voice oh right i remembered that you mentioned that harry replied sheepishly just hurry up and get back to the girls hermione told him quickly harry walked very quickly back to the room where the girls smiled as they saw him you were out there for quite a while we were starting to get worried allie spoke up i sorry if i worried you guys harry replied apologetically oh we were getting worried that maybe you had fallen in sue commented hermione just giggled in response to that one and said ask her if she would have saved you would you have saved me harry asked raising his eyebrows i definitely would though i think that people would wonder why i running into the men room sue responded with a smile it good to know that i in safe hands harry answered with a large grin i couldntleave you stranded could i sue answered with a grin harry replied with a smile and said why donti finish the game cocky now arentyou sue teased him i wouldntsay cocky just confident in my own abilities harry answered after a thought no i d say you were cocky you ve always been cocky hermione interjected to harry well we ll see about that wontwe sue answered smiling harry eyed each of the balls and confidently and quickly pocketed them winning the game well then now at least i know your confidence is well warranted sue answered quickly harry just offered a grin and offered his hand as a sign of a good game it was fun wasntit sue remarked it really was harry answered back and turned around and walked a few spaces away before asking why did you think that i never said that you werentgood but it doesntmean that you arentcocky hermione answered with a slightly amused tone in her voice well what can i say i know what i can do harry replied with a smile you do know that attitude of yours could have gotten you killed a bunch of times hermione added in a knowing voice operative word almost i didntdie now did i harry replied very quietly but you almost did look i know that right now it harmless but in the end it could cause trouble hermione asked quietly why are you bringing this up now harry asked with a sigh i sorry harry i know that it not a big deal but it just brings back some bad memories hermione said quietly no hermione i sorry i should have realized that it would you were there when it happened you saw everything that happened you were just worried about me harry responded thanks it been such a long time now i really okay though you know anyways i also should point out that not all girls like cocky guys we like confident guys but not cocky guys hermione reminded him thanks for the reminder hermione do you really think that i that bad harry inquired no you re not sometimes you are but most of the time you aren t you have a lot of other qualities make up for it hermione replied softly is there anything that i can do to make you feel better harry asked softly harry then felt a hand on his shoulder and he turned around harry christine asked yes christine are you ready to play harry replied quickly i am but are you sure you are okay christine asked concerned okay then tell her that you were crying because you were thinking about how your godfather died and that you couldntdo anything to save him hermione told him i okay i was just harry started i want you to tell everybody you did say that you wanted to help me feel better right hermione added looking at his hesitancy harry then said do you mind if we sit down first of course not christine answered with a look of surprise but followed him to the tables where the rest of the ladies sat as i was just about to say that it is just not a great time for me right now because i was just thinking about how my godfather died and it makes me feel really sad because i wasntable to save him harry told her you should feel so bad harry i sure that you were not responsible chloe told him in an understanding tone if you dontmind me asking but what happened sue asked softly hermione noticed that harry looked a little puzzled as to how to answer so she decided to help him out and said dontlook so shocked harry you donthave to give the details but just say how it happened generally tell them that you got some information and went to go check it out and somehow your godfather got wind of the information and came to help you out but he ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time and by the time you found out you were too late it alright i got some information from someone and i went to go check it out and somehow my godfather found out about it and he came to help me out but he ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time and when i found out about it i was too late to save him harry answered there is no way that you would have known about that sue commented dontbeat yourself up over it it was an accident there is no way you could have prevented it christine told him giving him a hug i kind of know how you feel not exactly but it really was more my fault than anything it was my brother and we got into this argument and i just ran off really upset being the great brother that he was he came after me and because of it he was hit by a car and he died allie said quietly allie i am so sorry that must be a horrible feeling sue said giving her a hug allie wow i so sorry to hear that but there was no way you knew about the car so it was not your fault harry told her with a understanding look everyone told me that it wasntmy fault that it was just an accident but i just canthelp feeling that it was my fault allie said to harry i know the feeling you didnthave to tell us that you know harry replied walking over to allie and gave her an affectionate squeeze i know but i felt like that it was something i needed to get off my chest and thanks to you i felt like i could allie responded giving him a slight smile and a hug what is she up to i cantfind anything on her and this would be something that the police would keep record of i dontlike how she seems to be getting closer to harry hermione thought to herself but she couldntget the voice out of her head saying that maybe there really is nothing wrong with her and this was all because he liked allie in a way that he could never like her a n hello everyone i would like to start off and thank all of my readers and reviewers it means a lot that you guys reviewed i so sorry for the long wait between updates thanks for your patience please review and read until the end cause there are some questions at the end i would like you to answer disclaimer i dontown harry potter jkr does and i dontown the bachelor abc does this fic is for entertainment purposes only chapter 13 hermione sighed as she continued to watch everyone continue to give allie their regards she still did not know what she should do about the whole situation and she was worried that if she mentioned to harry that he would just get mad at her and overreact like he did before so she needed to get some firm evidence and then proceed from there just then she heard some footsteps outside her door so hermione quickly put away her computer and turned down the volume of her mike before magically unlocking the door and seeing who was outside jennifer did you want to ask me something hermione asked it is the strangest thing i did want to talk to you about something and then when i got up here i just realized that i needed to do something else jennifer answered sheepishly that alright i was heading downstairs myself hermione assured her i hope that you werentbusy jennifer replied oh i was just listening to some music so what up hermione asked with a smile oh we were actually all kind of bored and i kind of got annoyed with stephanie downstairs so i thought i would come up and see what you were doing jennifer told her what did stephanie do now hermione inquired she was just being her nosey and annoying self asking us all tons of questions and of course mentioning her great career as usual jennifer told her as they walked down the stairs that does sound like stephanie hermione commented as the reached the kitchen well look who decided to grace us with her presence stephanie commented hello to you too stephanie hermione said rolling her eyes hey hermione callie and lisa called out hey guys what are you guys up to hermione inquired actually we were just planning to watch something on the tv callie answered how well do you guys know allie hermione decided to pipe in not too well but we have talked lisa answered did she ever mention any family that she had hermione asked carefully actually when i really think about it we chatted but she hardly ever mentioned anything about herself lisa replied after pondering for a moment are you sure hermione asked yeah i am i mean whenever i asked her about her she would change the subject but she did ask a lot about you lisa replied what about you callie hermione asked i only chatted with her a couple of times but i get the impression she doesnthave much family or something but we never did talk about it but she did ask me questions about the rest of you though callie answered why are you asking callie asked hermione puzzled she just one big puzzle to me and i guess i was hoping to figure her out hermione admitted that is something i definitely agree with the strangest thing is how interested she seemed in you though lisa commented she was hermione asked yes she did and i agree that there seems to be something that is quite strange about her but if you would like i could check her out for you if you want callie told her i wouldntwant you getting into any trouble or anything hermione told her pouring herself a glass of grapefruit juice oh it wouldntbe besides if you re worried about the producers dontworry i can be very discreet callie told her i have some valuable sources that could help in this situation if you want stephanie piped in it totally alright stephanie i dontwant to make this that big of a deal but um thanks anyways hermione told her after a moment she so just needed to be the center of attention lisa whispered to her hermione stifled a giggle and quickly finished her juice and looked at the clock on the stove and realized that she needed to get back to watching the date i going to take a quick nap upstairs hermione announced okay then hermione talk to you later lisa said with a wave hermione hurried quickly upstairs locked the door magically and turned up the volume on the microphone and the computer and now saw that christine and harry were playing pool i back hermione whispered into the microphone harry turned around quickly and murmured i was getting worried about you are things okay yeah everything is fine i just heard some footsteps outside the door so i went to check that out and i had to make an appearance outside of my room so the other girls wouldntbe so suspicious hermione explained hermione watched quite fascinated at the precision of christine shots and how easy she made it look i thought that you didntplay much harry asked i a really quick study and it depends on the definition of much christine added well then i quite impressed harry answered with one of his dazzling grins christine looked dazed for a moment then missed the next shot that was not fair you distracted me she said good naturedly concentration is a very important part of the game harry said with a sly grin harry you did that on purpose hermione said sternly but was holding back a grin i was giving you some important advice harry told christine oh you were well then what kind of advice was that christine asked intrigued that concentration is really important in this game you shouldntlet anybody distract you harry answered slyly sure i dontbelieve that but i letting you get away with it this time just because what you said is true christine added harry expertly did some angle shots and finished it off with a shot behind his back impressive christine replied with applause you were an amazing opponent harry told her with a great smile as christine as walking towards harry to give him a hug she suddenly out of nowhere tripped on a small piece of rock harry rushed over to help her up i so embarrassed christine replied flushed dont worry about it it could have happened to anybody harry reassured her helping her on her feet tell her about the time that you tripped during graduation and ripped your pants hermione instructed i ll let you on a little secret not really a secret but i ve been embarrassed worse it was during my graduation and i was heading up to receive my diploma and as i got up my robe got caught in the chair and it ripped of course i had no idea until i was up on the stage and realized that my pants were ripped and everyone could see in the audience include my fellow grads harry explained that would be pretty embarrassing thanks for sharing it christine giggled and gave him a smile can you ask her how she tripped hermione asked no problem i was just wondering if you knew what exactly happened here harry inquired well now to think about i have no idea how it happened it was like the strangest thing it was like that rock came out of no where and now look at my shoe christine said as she stood up stumbling can i take a look at it harry asked christine shrugged and took it off and harry examined the thin silver pump and he found that the heel had been broken that heel is definitely broken but not in the normal way hermione commented as she saw how the heel seemed to be scorched in some way and not broken off in the normal way harry looked puzzled so hermione shook her head and said ask her if her shoes were already breaking hermione told him were they breaking off before harry asked no in fact they are actually quite new christine replied with a sigh offer to fix her shoe hermione urged him i can fix it for you if you like harry offered i dontwant to be a bother christine told him dont worry about it i ll be back before you know it harry replied harry walked over to an area where he knew nobody would be watching and took out his wand and said reparo and the shoe became as good as new hermione what is going on harry asked i just wanted to understand the situation because the fact that she tripped is very strange considering how there could be a object that size in the bar was a little strange hermione commented that is true so have you come up with anything yet harry asked was allie anywhere near by hermione hesitantly asked well she was watching the match why do you want to know harry replied just trying to gather all the facts hermione exclaimed i was just wondering how you girls walk in these thin hilled shoes harry asked all of a sudden why are you asking hermione asked curiously i have never actually seen one of these up close and i ve always wondered that harry explained well it takes a lot of practice and its just a matter of balance hermione answered it must be painful harry said noticing how high the heel was the cost of beauty hermione said with a smile okay i think i going to head back now the shoe should be dry by now if i had done it used glue harry added with a wink harry walked back pondering what hermione had told him here is your shoe harry said handing her the shoe christine smiled gratefully and put it back on wow it almost like it was brand new i have some really strong glue harry replied sheepishly allie are you ready harry asked as ready as i will be i quite nervous allie confessed there is no need to be this is just all for fun harry told her allie nodded and proceeded over to the pool table do you want to go first harry asked actually i was wondering if you would start the game allie asked taking in a deep breath are you sure harry asked i sure i want to watch you first allie replied alright then harry answered a little surprised harry started off the game with a nice shot that spread out the balls even and managed to knock one in the hole he continued making great shots until the last ball that seemed to stop just right before it was about to enter the hole it your turn now harry replied did you happen to miss the last shot on purpose allie asked curiously why would you ask that harry asked i thought that maybe you wanted to give me a chance to win allie commented as much as i would love to say that i did i was actually surprised when the shot didntgo in i guessing that this is your lucky day harry answered sheepishly i guessing that it is allie replied with a smile her first shot was pretty shaky but she managed to get the first ball into the hole as she got in shot after shot her confidence grew and said i guess that i haventloss all my skills after all i guess not harry answered with a smile watching her using the cue with such ease last shot allie replied flustered good luck harry replied standing off to the side allie took a deep breath and slowly began staring at the layout of the ball in front of her trying to figure out the best way to go about it it looked like she was muttering something from what hermione was saying but she could not make it out allie then took the last shot and managed to knock it into the hole allie came out looking incredibly happy and exclaimed oh my god i cantbelieve i made that shot it looks like i win doesntit yes you do congratulations harry said giving her a hug a kiss on the cheek congratulations christine and sue chimed in great job chloe responded with a tight smile so when do i get that free lesson allie asked probably another time after the show but i doubt that you really need much help harry answered great then that means we will still see each other after the show is done allie replied with a smile harry grinned back and heard hermione clearing her throat i getting a bit hungry how about we get something to eat harry asked sure the girls exclaimed they walked over to the table where they there was a lot of food placed on the table at least 25 types of sushi some tempura some noodles and miso soup were placed on top of the table and the chef was preparing some of his specialty dishes right in front of them the group ate quickly chatting quickly about the game and asking each other different types of questions so chloe i was wondering what you think of the food so far harry asked the food is just amazing and i think that it really very tasty but i no expert chloe answered okay i have a question for all of you guys how important is your moral standards to you in everyday life harry asked well i think that is one of the most important things in life for me i think that the most important thing is that that you can do everything you can to do your best but only to the point that you feel like you did nothing wrong and can live with yourself christine replied thoughtfully i agree with that as long as you have no qualms about what you are doing then it should not be a major problem chloe added i agree to a point but sometimes i think that yes it is wrong for people to lie but sometimes isntit best not to tell people the absolute truth because it would hurt their feelings and sometimes a little white lie wonthurt anyone sue added after a thought i agree with all of you guys on this issue being able to have no qualms about what you are doing is really important but sometimes i totally understand that there are so many things in life that other people wouldntwant to know or things you just dontsay because the rules are just the way they are allie answered quietly i understand what all of you guys are saying i ve always lived by one thing one of my best friends told me to believe in yourself and to listen to your heart it ll tell you what the right thing to do is harry replied in your line of work dontyou have to lie sue asked we do when we have to but we do try to lie as little as possible and answer truthfully most of the time most of the job just involves doing our jobs and revealing who we are harry explained i assume that you usually have to separate your personal lives from when you are working or else that could cause problems allie commented tell her how you ve haventhad a long relationship in years hermione commanded yes it is i mean i haventbeen in a long term relationship in years harry said embarrassed i dontreally believe it but it would make sense or else you wouldntbe here would you chloe replied thoughtfully yeah like i told you guys before i didntthink i would be on this show either but i have my reasons harry answered with a slight smile whatever they are i just happy that i have got a chance to meet you sue added ditto chloe and christine added here to a great end to the night harry said with a gigantic grin and rising his glass after they finished eating the girls returned in high spirits back to the mansion allie was extremely happy and the girls were happy but not quite as happy as her good night harry hermione told him as she turned off the microphone wait a minute hermione harry said what is it hermione asked i was wanted to say that i had a nice time tonight and enjoyed having you around it was nice to have your input on the evening harry told her softly so i see that it wasntas horrible as you thought it was hermione teased him i know that you could have done a lot worse but you didntand i wanted to thank you harry said with a smile well i wouldntwant the producers to start asking too many questions and i didntwant to make you look like a complete idiot hermione answered with a smile i know i ll talk with you later have sweet dreams harry whispered to her sweet dreams to you too harry hermione answered with a smile and turned off the microphone and slid back in her chair as she decided that she would re watch some of the strange events that occurred during the evening she had saved it to her computer using a simple conversion spell she first watched christine missed shot at first there wasnt anything that deemed special attention to but then she noticed that she seemed a little dazed sure harry smile was incredible and very charming but he could never do that even if harry ego would say otherwise she thought to herself with a giggle there seemed to be something unnatural about her dazed look so she zoomed in and in the back ground she saw a small movement very difficult to detect she zoomed in on the dot and saw that allie had moved on up she didntseem to be doing anything special though she just looked like she was walking about she re watched it a few times but couldntfind any new leads so she decided to watch the part when christine fell she watched the floor very closely and in a split second she noticed a slight spark and in there was a small object on the floor near christine feet that she never noticed before she was about to check again when she heard a knock on her door she quickly closed that program and said come on in allie came in and she forced a smile and said hi allie how are you doing i doing great allie replied with a smile how was your date hermione asked well it went amazingly well we ate japanese food and played pool which i won against harry and he going to give me a free lesson as a prize allie answered that awesome allie arentyou tired hermione asked pointing to the time i a little bit tired but i really excited over the win allie told her i ll expect that how did the other girls do hermione asked quickly christine did the best after me but she missed the last shot are you using your computer allie asked um i was just checking on some e mail from friends hermione answered quickly do you think i could check something really quickly it ll only take a few seconds allie asked sure hermione replied not knowing how she could say no hermione watched her closely as she quickly checked her e mail with a slight turn of her head when she looked at hermione i sorry you must have been in a hurry to use your e mail it okay as long as i get it done really soon it ll be okay hermione answered oh too bad not the e mail i was looking for thanks i think i ll head to bed allie said with a yawn see you tomorrow hermione said you too allie said heading out as soon as she left she opened up back the program and watched it again and noticed that the small object had been there for quite a while that is strange my eyes must have been playing tricks on me hermione muttered to herself in disbelief maybe allie did something but you were watching her the whole time she just checked her e mail hermione argued with herself hermione yawned as she looked at the time and decided to ponder it more in the morning so the next chapter is the rose ceremony which three girls do you want out it time for your input is it stephanie christine allie sue jennifer chloe lisa or callie thanks a lot for answering the question a n sorry for the long delay in the update i will try to update sooner for the next chapter things just came up and i wasntable to finish writing this chapter thanks so much to everyone who reviewed oh i want you guys to vote onto which groups of girls you want to go on a date together with harry and who gets the individual date now i know who most of you probably want to get the individual date so i do have a plan for that and yes there will be some lovely h hr loving in the next chapter i promise you disclaimer i dontown harry potter it belongs to jkr and i dontown the bachelor which is owned by abc this fic is for entertainment purposes only chapter 14 after quite a stressful morning harry decided to take a quick nap before he had to get ready for the show harry woke up to a knock on the door and quickly got up and answered the door with a yawn good afternoon mr potter kevin the producer responded hello kevin what are you doing here harry inquired inviting him inside i just wanted to see if you were okay kevin replied walking in what do you mean harry asked you didntsee quite yourself last night kevin explained oh about that i wasntfeeling quite myself that way but i assure you that i feeling much better today harry answered that really good to hear we were getting a little worried about you kevin explained worried harry asked nervously we were worried that maybe all of this pressure might have gotten to you kevin explained dont worry i really fine harry assured them that good tonight the next rose ceremony kevin reminded harry i haventforgotten about it dontworry about me you will see that i am fine harry answered okay then just so you know that after the ceremony one of the lovely ladies remaining will be receiving an individual date from you kevin told him great i wontforget thanks harry told him hermione this is entirely your fault harry muttered to himself as he closed the door hermione had spent most of her morning in the studio doing some commentary for the episodes that have not aired yet and would be added when the episode aired on the television she then decided to check out the video she had saved on her computer from the night before she played the footage from last night again and scanned it for anything mysterious and noticed that the object has been there for quite some time before she tripped she reviewed the tape a few times and didnt come up with anything new except that her eyes had been playing tricks on her before and the other possibility would be hard to prove since she had absolutely no idea how allie could have changed whatever happened on the screen unless she wasnta muggle either but she never heard of any spell that could have been done that would work on muggle technology but she was determined to find out if there were any spells that were written for this particular purpose she quickly walked on over to area of her room where she had hidden all of her books on spells and and other books that she used for her work that she didntwant the other girls to find she then began to search through the chapters of the books to find if anything that might be related to using it against muggle technology after searching for a few hours and coming up with nothing she closed her book in frustration as she heard a knock on her door she quickly hid the book away and said come on in jennifer and chloe entered the room and said hey hermione what up hermione asked with a smile i just nervous about the rose ceremony tonight jennifer answered i am a little bit too chloe admitted you guys shouldntworry too much you guys seemed to have a good time with harry on the last date hermione reassured them i hope so but you never know what a guy is thinking chloe responded that is true hermione admitted i dontthink that you have anything to worry about though hermione chloe noticed what do you mean hermione asked nervously it just seemed like you and harry got along pretty well so it doesnt seem like he would pick to kick you off jennifer explained i hope so but as you say with guys you never know what they are thinking hermione added yeah isntthat the truth chloe added sitting down how was your date last night jennifer asked chloe it went nicely for awhile until allie went up chloe explained what happened hermione asked as if she didntknow well nothing really except that she was the only who won at the game of pool chloe explained what did she win jennifer asked well harry was going to give a free pool lesson to whoever did the best at the game of pool chloe answered i guess you guys must all be so disappointed that she won did anything else happen hermione pressed well nothing unless you count on christine tripping chloe answered when exactly did christine trip jennifer asked actually it is kind of funny because she tripped right after she had played pretty well she was actually the closest one of us to almost win the game of pool chloe explained oh that must have been embarrassing jennifer said with a laugh it was you should have seen her face i dontmean to be mean but i am glad that it wasntme chloe commented chloe we all have felt that way so it is a very normal feeling jennifer told her with a smile yeah i sure that the others felt the same way you did but out of curiosity what exactly did christine trip on hermione asked her i not exactly sure what it was but it looked like a rather large rock or hard object chloe replied after some thought oh so was there any other reason you were looking for me hermione asked we were just wondering if you wanted to eat something with us before the ceremony jennifer asked i ll be down in a minute i am a little hungry hermione said with a slight smile yeah we have noticed that you were up in your room for quite some time chloe commented what were you doing jennifer asked curiously i was catching up on some stuff that i needed to do for work hermione answered quickly you re very work conscious arentyou chloe asked hermione well i dontwant to miss out on too much work hermione replied sheepishly i know how you feel but it was nice to have a break from everything jennifer commented it is hermione said with a smile we ll see you downstairs then chloe replied with a wave i will be downstairs in a few minutes hermione replied with a little wave as she watched chloe and jennifer walk down the stairs hermione quickly put away her book and closed her laptop and gave the room a quick glance to make sure that she did not leave anything suspicious out for anybody to find and headed downstairs to meet the other girls harry stood pacing back and forth in front of the board where he placed the pictures of all the women remaining as he thought about his experience with each of them and made his final decisions for which girls to remain his eyes lingered on hermione as he thought about how amazing she was and happy that she was there to help him out he walked out to the dining hall where the ceremony was going to take place the roses were in place matthew walked in a few minutes later and greeted harry with a smile how are you doing matthew asked a little bit nervous and sad about having to say good buy to three more girls harry replied with a shaky grin well this is the last round you have to get rid of three girls at one time from the next ceremony on it will be one by one matthew replied that good news i t will make the decision making process easier harry added with a grin so you sure you made the right choice matthew asked looking at the clock as well as i can be harry said matthew you re on in a minute the camera man told them mathew nodded and quickly looked over his notes and put them down as the camera man signalled for him to start it that time again for the rose ceremony where mr potter has only 6 roses remaining to hand out to the 9 remaining women which six will he choose matthew asked as the 9 women walked down the stairs in formation matthew gestured for harry to step forward and take his first rose i d like to say that it getting harder and harder each and every time i have to do this and i had a great time getting to know each and every one of you harry spoke and took a deep breath and called out chloe would you accept this rose chloe stepped up and answered yes i would love to harry smiled and gave her a hug christine will you accept this rose harry asked it would be my pleasure christine answered and gave him a kiss on the cheek hermione stood nervously as the number of girls beside her dwindles down she put on a smile for the cameras what if he decides that he doesntwant to stick to the plan any more she thought to herself she knew that it was possible since the number of women remaining was decreasing and he obviously could never think of her in that way stop thinking like that you donteven want him to think of him this way she told herself harry smiled as he watched her squirm and finally called out hermione would you do me the honour of accepting this rose yes i will hermione replied with a smile and turned to whisper in his ear you enjoyed seeing me flustered didntyou i couldnthelp it because you look so adorable when you are flustered harry whispered back i should slap you for that hermione told him giving him a hug you couldntslap such an adorable face harry whispered as they broke apart you re the only person that i would ever let get away with a comment like that hermione whispered back while pretending to kiss him on the cheek and she walked back to her place the women who did not receive a rose please take a moment to say your goodbyes and you have a few minutes to pick up your things before you have to leave the house matthew announced stephanie walked up to harry first and said it was nice getting to know you i guess that we didntclick as well as i would have liked us to it was nice getting to know you too our personalities didntmatch well enough for it to be a long term relationship harry replied with a slight smile you know i a straight forward person and everything and because its part of my nature to get to the truth so i was just wondering if your decision had anything to do with what other people have been saying stephanie asked you donthave to worry about anything like that because i do make my own decisions based on what i see and of course how i feel which of course cantbe changed by other people harry replied with a slight grin realizing now that he had definitely made the right decision in not giving her the rose that good to know maybe i ll see you around stephanie asked giving him a hug you never know we might run into each other again harry replied with a slight grin next walked up was sue and she replied i really glad that i had a chance to get to know you i wish we would have more time to really get to know each other i had a good time getting to know you too i would love it if i had a bit more time with everyone but i did do the best with the time that i had harry replied goodbye sue said with a wave harry nodded with a small smile last of the group walked up jennifer who gave him a hug and whispered i glad that we have met and i hope that we can be friends she told him we are already friends harry responded with a smile jennifer smiled back and headed over to say goodbye to hermione and chloe hermione i going to miss you jennifer said dont worry we will definitely keep in touch hermione said giving her a hug there is no doubt about that we re going to miss you chloe told her also giving her a hug as hermione turned to say good bye to sue she saw stephanie looking a little bit shocked over being kicked out she looks pretty upset with being kicked off chloe commented to hermione not to mention bewildered sue commented with a slight grin stephanie best of luck to you lisa walked up to her i have no idea why he would decide not to give me a rose i mean it totally his loss stephanie muttered out loud i cantbelieve she has no idea why i mean its pretty obvious because she like conceited callie commented to hermione and chloe hermione giggled softly and walked over to join the rest of the girls and they each grabbed a glass of champagne here to us harry said looking straight at hermione with a slight wink hermione smiled back with a grin and lifted her glass to join allie lisa callie chloe and christine chimed as they tapped glasses hermione woke up the next day feeling quite refreshed after a good night sleep she was looking forward to the new day and the activities that the day may bring as she left the room to go to breakfast she heard a beep on the computer signalling that she had a new e mail she eagerly checked to see if she got any information on allie she read the e mail eagerly to find out if there was any new information inside she didntfind anything truly interesting she found that allie seemed like a pretty normal girl who liked to read and was quite and liked to help others the only thing that is odd is that she seemed to have quite a lot of money for someone of her age and nothing much is know about her parents her lifestyle and habits were similar to her which wasntanything shocking but felt a little bit odd to her that was a point that hermione was very interested in looking into she smiled now that she had a plan of action and walked downstairs to grab some breakfast good morning chloe and christine hermione replied cheerfully you re in a good mood this morning christine commented did anything happen last night chloe asked curiously nothing happened canti be in a good mood for no reason hermione asked of course you can we were just curious that all christine replied with a smile hey girls callie and lisa said as they walked in to grab some orange juice good morning hermione said as she poured the milk you seem cheerful today callie replied with a smile why does everyone ask me that am i normally not cheerful hermione asked sheepishly that not what we mean at all you just seem extra cheerful today you re normally very bright and pleasant christine assured i feel cheerful myself with a certain person out of the house lisa said with a grin who cheerful allie asked walking into the kitchen nobody just enjoying the fact that we donthave to share the house with three other people chloe answered ah you re enjoying the peace and quiet without stephanie allie added so you must notice that too callie answered well it is quite obvious that she wasntvery popular around here allie answered quietly reaching for the milk you re having cereal today hermione inquired yes do you have a problem with that allie asked of course not it just that you usually have toast or eggs in the morning hermione replied i felt like a time for a change allie answered nonchalantly looking her straight in the eye why were you asking about her eating habits christine asked her curiously no reason i just like to ask whatever question is on my mind hermione replied a little flustered and uneasy after the last comment from allie just then the doorbell rang and lisa ran out to see what it could be and came back with a tiny jewellery box that looked very old made from wood and was decorated with tiny jewels and a tiny key did you open it yet chloe asked eagerly not yet are we all here lisa asked yep we all are hermione answered they all waited anxiously as lisa opened the jewellery box and found inside a miniature rose and two letters what does it say christine asked softly the first note explains that this would be the first time that mr potter will be able to pick which girls he would like to go on the first group date and it also tells us that the date for tonight will be a cultured night of fun lisa explained scanning the note cool what does the other one say chloe asked it explains that one lucky one of us will be picked to get the first individual date with harry and will be picked by the producers using some sort of poll measure lisa explained what kind of poll hermione asked it doesntreally explain anything but it probably more like a popularity poll or something chloe pondered seems quite likely but maybe it is just by luck of the draw callie asked i just excited that harry is going to choose some of us for tonight now we can see who he really likes allie commented that is a very good point chloe explained smiling now i wonder who got the individual date chloe wondered aloud a n thanks to everyone who has read and reviewed this story it means so much to mean that you guys have stuck with me on this this chapter was sort of hard to write in a way and i hope that you enjoy it i had to take some time and read up on some dances for this chapter and i really hope that you enjoy it this has some of the h hr fluff that you guys have been waiting for now what happens here i wrote because it needed to happen to move the story along and i really hope that you guys continue to enjoy this update and continue to review disclaimer i dontown anything see chapter 1 chapter 15 all the girls nervously got ready to meet harry in the foyer anxiously awaiting his decision for the first group of girls for an afternoon date and then an evening date with one individual girl hermione was quite on edge herself because she was quite unsure of whom harry was going to choose to go on this group date with him she was really hoping that he would choose her to be part of this group date because that would mean that it was possible that he might actually have feelings for her she was pretty sure that she would not be picked for the individual date because her part in the show was to play the spy and that was all she could be harry walked into the foyer with a nervous heart because he never wanted to hurt anybody feelings but it was the way the show worked and was greeted by one of the producers hello mr potter ken responded it good to see you too harry answered with a smile i wanted to let you know there has been a schedule change and that you will be having the individual date only today and the group date will be set for tomorrow ken explained do the women know yet harry inquired we will explain it to them in a moment there has been a scheduling conflict so we had to move one of the dates i hope that doesntcause you any problems ken replied of course not i quite excited to see who the individual date is with harry said with a smile i sure that you will be quite surprised ken replied with a grin good afternoon ladies there has been a change in schedule and the group date will be set for tomorrow but you will still find out his choices for the group date today matthew replied as he entered the mansion the girls were disappointed but they would at least know who he would choose for the date they all stood anxiously awaiting harry decision mr potter will choose three girls to receive the first group date but before he makes his decision we would like to announce which one of you will receive the individual date tonight matthew replied matthew passed out some envelopes to the six remaining ladies and then said would the individual who received the date please step forward i am hermione replied as she stood forward harry noticed that she looked quite shocked and in a way so was he chloe and christine smiled and congratulated hermione with a smile and a quick hug as they stood back into place now mr potter will announce the three women out of the remaining women to go on the group date tomorrow night matthew answered my choices for the group date are christine allie and callie harry announced after taking a deep breath christine allie and callie smiles grew larger as they heard their names announced congratulations to each of you and now it is time for the individual date to being matthew announced shall we harry asked offering his arm to hermione hermione smiled slightly and took his arm as they walked out of the mansion you look lovely harry whispered in her ear hermione blushed in response as she looked down at her blue halter style gown with layered chiffon and a cut down the thigh of her leg showing off strong legs and accentuating her skinny waist and shapely arms where are we off to today hermione asked i have no idea but i see that you were quite surprised to be chosen harry added of course i was the producers know who i really am so i wouldnt think that it would make any sense to chose me at all hermione explained i wasntas surprised harry told him why hermione inquired because of how lovable you are and since the decision is based on a popularity poll it is highly likely that the audience would like you harry explained well when you put it like that it does seem to make sense but i guess i would have thought that the producers wouldnthave let something like this to happen but then again the audience does not know who the spy is at this point in time and they wouldntwant them to get suspicious if i did happen to win the poll hermione replied now there the confidence that i like to see harry added as they entered the limousine once inside they found an envelope containing a note telling them to turn on the television and play the video it a good thing that we know all about muggle devices or else things could get really complicated on the show hermione commented i agree harry added with a chuckle and played the video the video showed a magnificent building with marble halls and two beautifully dressed dancers announcing that that they were going to teaching the both of them how to dance the tango i ve always wanted to learn to dance the tango did you know that the tango originated in montevideo and is formed from a mix of different cultures african indian latin and argentina influences to form a new popular music it originally was a dance used to communicate emotions sexual energy and contained suggestive motions in the early 1900 it evolved to become less vulgar and gained popularity in high society hermione replied eagerly i had no idea you know so much about the tango harry replied amused i happen to know a lot about many other things that you dontknow about hermione replied in a teasing tone that i am not surprised by harry said laughing hermione hit him on the arm playfully and replied what is so funny about that nothing i was just picturing you during 7th year completely hidden behind all of your books harry answered after a moment i did not have that many books hermione replied in a defensive tone you were a complete bookworm harry interjected i happen to enjoy reading there is nothing wrong with that hermione answered sitting back i never said that there was anything wrong with it i just thought that it was an amusing memory that i like to hold on to harry explained with a smile why would you want to hold onto a memory like that hermione asked it was during a happy time in my life when i met you and ron and i like to have something that i can make fun of you for harry replied playfully hermione just punched him lightly in the arm and then said we re stopped we must be here the limousine stopped in front of a large building with many windows and the driver quickly opened the door to let the two of them out harry and hermione walked into the building to be met by a very elegantly dressed woman and man you must be mr potter and ms granger my name is alex and this is my partner johanna we are here to teach you the argentine tango alex greeted them with a smile thank you harry replied shaking alex hand i ready to learn thanks so much for teaching us hermione replied as he kissed her hand the tango basic step is one of the most recognizable steps so it is very important to remember to take all of your steps in the direction that you are traveling alex told them okay so first of all harry you will be taking heel to toe steps on the first beat step forward with your left foot slowly and on the second beat step forward with your right slowly on the first half of the third beat step forward with your left foot quickly on the second half of the third beat step slightly forward to the right side with your right leg on the beat four drag your left foot up the side of your right leg joanna explained now hermione you will be taking toe to heel steps on the first beat step back with your right leg slowly and on the second beat step back with your left leg slowly and on the first half of the third beat step back with your right leg quickly on the second half of the third beat step slightly back and to the left side with your left leg and on the fourth beat drag your right foot up the side of your left leg alex explained johanna and then alex proceeded to show harry and hermione what the basic step looks like slowly and the quickly why dontyou try it out by yourselves they asked harry and hermione stood facing each other and took a quick breath and listen to the beat before harry started to follow the instructions at first harry kept on looking at his feet and stepped on hermione toes as she was quite a quick study sorry hermione harry said embarrassed it alright you were never a very good dancer hermione replied with a slight smile that was just that one time harry exclaimed when we were first practicing you were horrible at dancing but after some practicing you were quite good hermione explained after a moment i will master this quite quickly harry said with confidence and then he stumbled causing hermione to giggle it not that funny this is actually hard harry muttered glaring at her i told you that your ego would cause you problems hermione said laughing hard alex walked towards them and offered his hand to hermione and turned to harry and said let me show you again alex expertly place his hand on lower back and showed harry his steps again and hermione followed not as fast at fast but soon was able to follow his steps that was great hermione you re a natural alex complimented hermione blushed at his compliment and replied it because i have a great teacher harry felt a twang of jealousy as she saw hermione blush at the handsome teacher and decided to step in i think i can try again harry added taking her arm and walking a bit away what was that about hermione asked curiously what was what harry asked innocently the whole grab my arm and walk away thing hermione replied nothing i just wanted to practice harry responded you didntwant me around him do you hermione replied her eyes twinkling why would i care harry answered looking away because you re jealous of him because he a good dancer and a handsome man hermione explained you think he handsome harry asked anybody with eyes would ay that about him harry hermione said rolling her eyes well i am not jealous harry replied firmly okay then well i think you re better looking hermione whispered in his ear harry instantly began to relax and a smile crossed his face which hermione noticed but decided not to comment on after about another half an hour of practice harry seemed to have gotten the hang of the basic step good now we can proceed to the next step harry on the first half of the first beat step forward with your left hand and then as you are taking the step give a small pull on the follower back with your right hand which tells your partner that you are leading the hesitation instead of the basic on the second half of the first beat then bring your right foot up beside your left foot and then lightly tough the left foot to the floor during the first half of the second beat step back with your right left and the guide your partner towards you with your right hand during the second half of the second beat bring your left foot beside your right by lightly touch the foot to the floor give a slight lean with your should into your partner left hand so they can sense the change in direction on the first half of the third beat step forward with your left leg and on the second half of the third beat step slightly forward and to the right side with your right and on the fourth beat drag your left foot up to the side of your right and hermione you just do the opposite alex explained harry nodded and slowly began to follow the instructions and placed his had behind the small of hermione back and proceed to step forward and back and leaning in when he wanted turn and was amazed at how well hermione responded to his change in direction it was as if she could sense what he wanted to do before he was going to do it you two are doing very well the two of you have a good partnership alex commented as he watched them now harry please pull your partner towards you with your right hand behind her back hermione place your left hand of harry upper arm just above his biceps and push against him but both of them should be done gently johanna explained hermione followed the directions and felt a tingle crawl up her spine as they touched and continued to dance quite closely and turned their heads to step forward and to the side in a four beat pattern the cheeks touching for a few minutes as they changed directions they turned the hands and locked hands once again they continued practicing like this for about an hour the two of you are doing amazingly well why dontyou try putting it all together now and start dancing for yourselves alex responded and gave harry and hermione a hug it great to meet the both of you johanna answered with a smile and gave harry and hermione a hug and kiss on the cheek before they both left the two of them alone harry and hermione nodded and turned to face each other as they waited for the music la rosita to start about and then the faced each other and raised their arms up in their upright positions and harry led quickly for a first step and hermione mirrored his actions perfectly and pretty soon harry had forgotten that there was anyone else in the room and couldnthelp but think about how soft her skin felt against his and how good it felt to hold her in his arms when they turned to face each other again and their eyes met and he noticed how beautiful she looked and she dragged her leg up and placed it up against his torso as she lightly ran her hand against his tight abs he then slid his hand up her thigh lightly before dipping her backwards and brought her back upward and lightly stroked her cheek at that particular moment all he could think about was how soft and luscious her lips were and how it would feel to kiss her he leaned down and after a moment of hesitation his lips touched hers and he kissed her softly at first hermione was surprised at first but after only a moment of hesitation she kissed him back while running her hands through his hair and relished the feel of his hair and this moment harry deepened the kiss as his hands pulled her closer to him causing hermione to lose her balance and tumble to the ground dragging harry down to the floor with her since their legs were intertwined they both landed on the floor with harry on top of her they stared at each other in the eyes until they heard some voice asking if they were alright they quickly untangled themselves and knocked harry out of his reverie and said i sorry it not a big deal you didntmean to land on top of me did you hermione replied reassuringly that not what i meant harry said softly what are you sorry about hermione asked nervously i let myself get carried away by the music and i shouldnthave i shouldnthave kissed you like that i mean you re my best friend and i shouldnthave taken advantage of you harry explained you didnttake advantage of me wait a minute are you saying that you re sorry that you kissed me hermione asked quietly i sorry that it happened harry said softly afraid to look up okay so if you had another chance you wouldnthave kissed me hermione asked again with tears threatening to leave her eyes harry nodded hermione slapped him hard and said loudly i cantbelieve you did this to me she then turned around and ran off harry ran after her yelling hermione but she wouldntlisten to him and she couldntreturn to the mansion for fear of questions harry was really mad at himself for hurting her it wasntthat he didnt want to kiss her because he knew that he did the truth was that he believed that she didntfeel that way about him he needed to do something to get her to forgive him he had never seen her so upset before and he couldntbear to see her hurting like this was he really falling for her harry was beginning to believe that he really was but he wasntsure maybe he really was just caught up in the moment hermione was walking around aimlessly with tears in her eyes as she thought through the events of the night the whole evening had been going so well and she could feel the connection between them growing and they were having tons of fun she couldntbelieve that she let it get so far why did she let him kiss him and kiss him back why did she let herself believe once again that harry might actually return the feelings that she had for him which she now knew that she had them moment that their lips met she knew that it was right she thought that he had felt it too but now she knew that he could only see her as his best friend and nothing more she was angry at herself for making such a big deal out of what had happened now she would have to explain to him why she was mad at him the truth was that she wasntreally angry at harry she was angry with herself she should have stopped it but she knew she needed to stay angry at harry in order for her to stop thinking about other things the fact remains the same he really shouldnthave kissed her like that if he didntmean it by the time she got home into the mansion it was really late and all the other women were asleep so she went up to her room really quietly without saying a word to anyone she didntfeel up to any questions tonight since she was emotionally exhausted and went into in dreamless sleep the next morning hermione woke up nice and early and once again she was glad because she still needed some time to think before she could face any of their questions of her fellow housemates she decided to go out for a walk in the morning to clear her head when she opened the door she found a bouquet of roses and lilies which were her favourite flowers harry hermione muttered to herself and was about to walk back inside when she felt someone grab her arm hermione please harry said as he pulled her towards him what is there left to say hermione asked him coldly hermione just listen to what i have to say okay harry pleaded with his puppy dog eyes because he knew she could not resist them hermione heart softened and said okay i ll give you 5 minutes i couldntsleep well last night after what happened between us all i could see was your face and i just couldntlet it stand like that i didntmean to hurt you i sorry that i was such an idiot it not that i didntwant to kiss you or that it was bad because you re not bad at all i mean i just dontwant it ruin our friendship harry blabbered on what are you trying to say hermione asked raising her eyebrows quite confused look what i trying to say is that i dontwant to lose you as a friend you re too important to me is there anything i can do to make it up to you harry asked softly you wontlose me you could never lose me i just need some time to myself okay maybe it for the best if we forgot that it ever happened hermione suggested with a sinking heart as she realized that he didntwant to be with her the way she wanted to be with him if that what you want harry replied earnestly it is hermione replied softly as she turned inside are we okay harry asked with a desperation in his voice hermione turned and looked into his eyes and she saw regret desperation sadness and hope and replied yes i mean we will be as harry watched her walk back inside he felt a tiny tug in his heart as if he was losing something very important to him he had felt that way especially after hermione wanted him to forget that the kiss ever happened she obviously didntfeel the way that he did about the kiss for him it was something that he could not forget a n thanks again to everyone who reviewed and i really glad that you guys are still enjoying the story i hope you also enjoy this chapter it was fun to write and i hope that the poetry i put in

you guys would help me out with something thanks a lot and please review and vote on who you would like out as usual disclaimer i dontown harry potter jkr does and i dontown the bachelor abc does this fic is for entertainment purposes only chapter 16 hermione had steadily avoided the other women in the house most of the morning by casting a simple repelling charm around her room she didnt want to answer any questions until she had a chance to keep her emotions in check because she knew that she couldntbe act like she was upset or hurt because otherwise the other women may get suspicious about her relationship with harry and that would definitely not be a good thing for the two of them she needed to stay in the mansion in order to help harry pick the women of his dreams and keep him away from allie there something about allie that seemed all wrong and she had to stay in the mansion to figure it all out she could never let harry choose someone that she thought was all wrong for him if she could help it she had to keep her emotions in check and think about the first part of the evening because before the end of the date took place she really had been happy she looked at her watch quickly and decided she needed to talk to someone about her current situation with harry she decided to talk to ginny about this because she would be the only person that would understand or could understand she quickly apparated outside of ginny flat back home and knocked on the door in order to give her friend some privacy she did not want to repeat what had happened the last time she had apparated into her flat without giving her any warning she had apparently walked in while ginny and draco were in the middle of well she saw way more than she ever wanted to see although it wasntexactly the worse sight she could see draco was quite good looking and fit but it wasntsomething she wanted to see again she couldntlook him in the eye for weeks suddenly the door opened and ginny opened the door and exclaimed hermione what are you doing here it good to see you too hermione replied with a grin come on in ginny replied leading her inside i just really needed to talk to someone hermione told her as she sat down tell me all about it and dontworry draco is out with some friends for most of the day ginny said as she was boiling water for some tea that good to know hermione said with a flush to her cheeks i cantbelieve you re still embarrassed about that i have forgotten all about it unless you actually want to see my boyfriend like that ginny replied teasingly of course not hermione exclaimed so you think he not good looking is that it ginny asked in mock anger that is not what i mean at all wait you re just teasing me arent you hermione asked looking at ginny who was holding back her laughter of course i am if i didntknow you were totally into harry i would be worried ginny replied after she stopped laughing i not into harry hermione protested come off it hermione everyone who knows you can tell that you are totally into him least of all me ginny exclaimed as she sat down is it that obvious hermione asked only to your friends so what did you want to talk about ginny told her reassuringly hermione explained the whole date and the dancing and the kiss and what happened afterwards he kissed you ginny exclaimed happily yes he did hermione responded with a smile finally so how was it ginny asked curiously what do you mean by finally hermione asked well it obvious to me at least that you ve had feelings for harry for ages and i was always sure that he had feelings for you as well but never admitted it it definitely about time so how was it ginny asked it was incredible amazing and felt so right hermione replied with a smile as she thought back to that moment yesterday ginny grinned as she got up to pour the water for the tea and replied i glad about that but what happened afterwards that you needed to talk to me about he said that he was sorry that he kissed me and something about not wanting to wreck out friendship but i think that maybe it was just a cover up so that my feelings wontbe hurt hermione explained sadly he is such a total prat i cantbelieve he even said that but seriously do you really think that he doesnthave any feelings for you ginny asked earnestly i dontknow i mean i thought he may have felt something but i so confused what do you think hermione asked sounding frustrated i think that honestly that you may have been thinking about things a little too much and that he really does have feelings for you and that he really is just too afraid to admit it because he doesnt want to lose you as a friend ginny responded slowly you really think so hermione asked i really do and he would be a total idiot not to know what an incredible person that you are but i pretty sure i am right because i have known you and harry for quite a long time and i sure that he is not a total ignoramus and that he will come back to his senses and admit how he truly feels ginny added thanks for your vote of confidence hermione replied with a smile and gave ginny a hug no problem why dontyou stay for a cup of tea ginny asked well i can stay for a little awhile or else they will notice that i am gone the charm that i put outside my room should be wearing off soon hermione said looking at her watch how long do you actually have ginny asked well about 15 minutes but i did strengthen the charm with another charm which should give me a few extra minutes which i added for safety purposes since i am living with muggles right now hermione explained brilliant as usual ginny replied handing hermione her tea with a tiny grin tugging on her lips of course i am hermione answered and received a napkin flown at her face and the two just burst out laughing by the time hermione got back to the mansion she was in a much happier mood and was smiling again and she once again checked her e mail to see if her friend had any more information on allie she was in luck because she just received a new message from one of her friends contacts whose name was chuck dear ms granger here is the information that you have requested regarding ms allie renshaw i hope that you find something of use concerning your friend she attended rutheford high school during her last year and went to college at nyu where she excelled and earned her science and teaching degree very quickly yours truly sergeant charles piper this is very interesting where did she go to school before the senior year in high school and how did she finish her degree so quickly i need to chat with the principal of her high school hermione thought to herself as she checked on her laptop for the phone number of the school she was looking for after a few minutes she found the number on quickly jotted it down and was about to call when she looked at her watch and realized that she needed to go and make an appearance downstairs before they will start looking for her she made her way downstairs after making sure that her notepad and computer were hidden away just in case anybody decided to do any snooping around hermione we were just going to check up on you chloe replied with a smile ahh i knew that was going to happen you want to know how the date went hermione answered with a knowing smile of course we do but only if you want to tell us christine replied it alright i can tell you about it we learned how to do the argentine tango in a beautiful hall and we had two great teachers whose names were alex and johanna they were both really talented and it didnt hurt that alex was but definitely not as cute as harry was hermione explained that sounds fun lisa replied did you have a good time callie asked i had an incredible time i love to dance and it was awesome to learn such a great dance that has been around for such a long time and open to interpretation and it was very romantic and sensual dance hermione replied with a grin and a dreamy look in her eyes as she thought back you are so lucky hermione you sound like you had an incredible time and i happy for you christine added with a sigh thanks christine hermione replied with a smile so you had a really good time allie asked suddenly appearing in front of her i really did what are you trying to get at hermione asked surprised nothing really it just that well i would have thought since you had a great time and all you would be more vocal about it in the morning but you haventbeen around it just doesntmake all that much sense to me allie replied in a soft serious tone well i wanted to keep those feelings for myself for awhile and i didnt want to be so vocal about it because it would seem like i was rubbing in your faces and i didntwant to do that hermione answered smoothly and a little bit disturbed by her questioning that was really nice of you to do for us chloe answered with a smile as walked past hermione to grab a bottle of water i guess so then but if you dontmind me asking where were you most of the morning allie asked after awhile what do you mean hermione asked curiously it just that as i was heading upstairs i noticed that you werentin your room and i was just curious as to where you were allie asked sweetly with a look of concern on her face i was just up in my room for a while and i took a walk for a bit but did you actually go inside my room hermione asked actually now that i think of it i was going to but than i just didntbut your door was open and it looked like you werentinside why are you asking allie explained well i do value my privacy but that was not the reason why i was asking you it just happens that i was in my room most of the morning and i didntsee you so i was just curious hermione answered quickly okay then where do you often take your walks allie asked allie stop bugging hermione i want to hear more about her date lisa piped in what else did you want to know hermione asked how well did the two of you do with the tango lisa asked we learned quite a lot and alex and johanna did say that we were doing quite well with it hermione replied you will definitely have to teach me how to tango later on cause i ve always want to learn how to do that callie added i could definitely try but i dontknow if i would be able to teach you very much hermione answered honestly i positive you will be able to teach me something even just the basics would be really great callie answered with a smile i could probably show you some steps sometime if you would like hermione said after she thought about it for a couple of minutes that would be really great of you callie said with a smile i could help you out as well chloe piped in you know how to tango hermione asked i do a bit i learned awhile ago but i am a little rusty chloe commented any help you could offer would be great callie responded with a smile so you guys excited about your group date hermione asked changing the subject away from herself i really am because it like the first time he actually picked some of us to go on it with him christine replied with a smile i am to and i cantwait to see where we are going to go callie added dont you have to go and get ready now hermione asked looking at the clock you re right he coming to pick us up in an hour allie replied immediately heading back upstairs callie and christine quickly followed suite and headed upstairs as well they really are something arentthey chloe commented yep they really are i have to return a quick phone call to my friend i ll see you later okay hermione replied sure i ll see you later today chloe answered back with a wave see you in a while then lisa said with a wave hermione headed upstairs and quickly silently cast a sound shielding charm around her room to prevent anybody from over hearing her conversation hello i was wondering who i could speak to chat with you about former students of yours hermione asked which student are you talking about because we have talked so many students over the years and we only stay in contact with a few of those students so it is highly likely that we wontbe able to hope you a women voice answered her name is allie renshaw hermione replied you re in luck because we still keep in contact with her but we havent spoken in over 6 months you can speak to our principal about her do you know an officer named chuck piper he was just asking about her as well the woman informed me actually i do know him he is a friend of mine hermione answered well that makes things easier when can you come to the school she asked when was it convenient for the principal hermione asked can you come in about an hour principal pierce would be available here what is your name the women asked it jane hermione replied after a thought well jane i ll see you in an hour and please ask for carolyn carolyn replied thanks you so much that ll be great i ll see you then hermione answered happily as she hung up she then looked around her room and went through her box of potions that she had brought just in case she ever needed it she had learned that being friends with harry could get pretty exciting but dangerous as well so wherever she went she had packed a few potions that she found could be useful in almost any situation to keep her friends and especially harry safe she began looking around and found that she had a tiny bottle of veritaserum left and decided to take some just in case she needed to use it she also had some polyjuice potion left which she decided might actually be useful as well and put it in her pocket before long she heard the door bell ring which signalled to her that harry had arrived and decided not to see him yet because she still didnt really know how to behave around him she also wanted to make him nervous about the whole situation harry had walked into the mansion and looked around to see if hermione was around he was hoping that she had completely forgiven him and would see her smile at him once again it was really unsettling for him to think that she has still mad at him and even though she said she was okay it seemed as it maybe she really wasn t hey harry callie called and greeted him with a hug callie you look wonderful this afternoon harry replied so do you callie commented christine you look fantastic harry added as he saw her walk up to him thank you christine replied with a smile harry continued to look around the stairway hoping to catch a glimpse of hermione and was disappointed not to see her at all harry allie called allie you look really great harry complimented on how good she looked in a modest yet not over revealing way thank you i really appreciate it allie replied looking down you guys ready to go harry asked taking one more glance upstairs before leading the ladies out the door they all nodded with a smile and walked outside the door and got into the limo after a few moments of silence allie turned to harry and asked are you okay excuse me harry asked i was just wondering if you are okay you seem a little preoccupied about something allie responded oh it nothing that you need to worry about harry answered maybe if you talked about it i could help you allie encouraged him harry if you dontwant to talk about it you donthave to but if you ever feel like you want to talk you know that we re all here for you christine piped in noticing harry uneasiness in allie questioning harry smiled in response and mouthed a thank you to christine which she returned happily i really sorry if i seemed pushy it just that with teaching i always found that talking about problems allie started to explain looking down hey allie i know you didntmean to it okay look at me please look at me harry told her as he leaned in closer to her allie looked up and as he was looking at her he suddenly felt a little bit lighter as if his problems disappeared are you okay harry allie asked concerned i good i must have just spaced out for a moment harry replied with a grin are you sure christine asked concerned i really fine harry replied touched by her concern where are we going callie asked we re going to a poetry reading harry answered with a smile i love poetry readings they can be quite fun allie commented is it going to be like an open mike kind of thing christine asked curiously i pretty sure that it is i thought it might be fun if we all tried to write one and perform it in front of a crowd it will be a nice chance to get to know each other a bit better harry explained that is true it could be really fun especially if we all write about something we know allie responded i have always wanted to attend one of these things so this will be great callie added it great that the three of you are looking forward to the poetry reading harry commented with a smile i think we will need to start thinking about it now then christine replied i agree that i will have to take a while to think about what to say as well allie added will there be a beat or is it music that we are going to be speaking with callie asked there will be someone playing an accompany string player harry explained that sounds really nice callie responded i agree christine added they all spent the next little while thinking up ideas for their poems and before long they arrived at the club we re here harry said looking outside the woman already i not ready yet to perform yet callie replied dont worry about it you donthave go up right away we can take some time and just chat together and listen to the other poems harry told her with a smile they walked into the club and saw that it was very nicely decorated with trees and small lamp shapes creating a calming environment and sat down at a table near the front and ordered some coffees then the host the event named ej walked up on the stage and said welcome to everyone who came here for the poetry reading today and let give a special welcome to the bachelor mr potter who is here today the crowd cheered as they shone a light towards their table on the table and they all gave a wave and smile now who would like to go up first ej asked a young lady went up onto the stage to applause and spoke coffee tastes bitter and strong but works like a charm to keep me awake when i need it most she then put down the mike to cheers and snaps what did you guys think harry asked not bad it very truthful and i love the music in the background allie responded who is up next ej asked once again christine decided to go up next and walked up to the stage to the sound of cheers this is called life away from home christine spoke into the mike life at home was a real drag i dreamed about the day that i would be free independent when that day came i was jumping for joy the words responsibility bills never crossed my mind until it came knocking on my door it was then i realized that life away from home is not all it hyped up to be that life is hard and to treasure what right in front of you christine got up and received great cheers and rounds of snaps she walked back to their table with a huge smile on her face that was great christine harry replied warmly why dontyou go up harry allie encouraged him go for it christine and callie commented it looks like we have a volunteer why dontwe give him a round of applause ej said harry got up and proceeded onto the stage at the crowd insistence this is my first time doing this and it going to be called family harry spoke into the mike nervously home family terms i did not understand it wasntuntil i met my friends that i realized that i had a family who cared about me and a place i could call home harry heard cheers coming from his table and around him and he grinned as he walked off the stage great job harry did you really have such a hard childhood callie asked my parents died when i was a baby so i never knew them harry answered that must have been really hard did you have to go to an orphanage christine asked i actually lived with my aunt and uncle harry answered quickly oh that was nice of them callie commented i guess was harry replied christine noticed his response and decided to change the subject and asked allie you want a chance to go up sure i ready allie said as they waited for the last speaker to finish allie then went up on the stage and cleared her voice she spoke as follows loneliness cant be escaped you feel alone even when you are surrounded by the ones you love you start to think does anyone understand does anybody care when will this feeling end wow i didntknow that she felt that way we may be more alike then i previously believe although a bit morbid harry thought to himself that was um good but a little bit morbid callie replied life unfair most of the time and since we re supposed to write about what we know i thought that was a good topic to write about allie responded nonchalantly that is true are you ready to go up callie christine asked as i ll ever be callie replied we have time for one final performer who wants to go up ej replied callie walked up onto the stage and took a deep breath and said this poem is called unpredictable every day you wake up go to work got to school and you come back home life is good until one day everything changes your perfect world is broken things happen that can never be forgotten things can never be the same again that life unpredictable the crowd was silent for a moment and then there waves of snaps which showed their appreciation and silent cheers great job harry told her with a smile great poem christine replied nice job allie added with a smile callie smiled in returned and took a sip of her drink let toast to a great afternoon christine suggested they all chimed glasses to signal the end of the date and sat down chatting quietly for few minutes before it was time for them to head back to the mansion a n i really sorry once again for the long wait i ve been quite busy and i glad that you guys are still with me and being patient it means so much to me thanks for all the reviews you guys it really means a lot to you any feedback is great and i d love to hear about your ideas about allie and what should happen thanks again and please review disclaimer i dontown anything this fic is for entertainment purposes only chapter 17 rutheford high school looked like any ordinary high school with a pretty large campus and seemed to have quite a bit of money in its budget since the school seemed relatively new hermione was quite nervous about her meeting with the principal and she did not know what to expect and hoped that they would not ask her to many questions about why she was interested in allie hermione took a deep breath and entered through the main entrance where there was a very clear sign indicating where the principal office was located she walked up to the front desk and rang the bell hello may we help you a nice looking woman in your early 30 replied yes i have an appointment with the principal hermione explained were you that young lady that called you hear asking about allie she asked hermione nodded and replied so you re carolyn yes i am then you must be jane carolyn answered with a smile it nice to meet you hermione answered principal pierce will be with you shortly carolyn answered with a grin and quickly picked up the phone your next appointment is here carolyn said into the phone quickly and then listened and nodded jane why dontyou have a seat the principal will be out shortly do you mind asking why you re asking about allie carolyn asked of course not i was just doing some research for an article that i writing hermione answered smoothly just then the phone rang and carolyn excused herself hermione breathed a sigh of relief as she did not want to answer any more questions because she was never someone who liked to lie just then an older yet distinguished looking man came out and greeted her thanks so much for taking the time to speak to me hermione replied with a grin it not a problem especially since you are friends with an officer we love to cooperate with the police and we assume then that you can be trusted principal pierce answered i like cooperating with law enforcement myself hermione answered with a smile so what would you like to know about allie renshaw he asked first of all i d like to know more about what kind of person she was at school hermione asked well allie was sort of a quiet individual who didnthave that many friends but she was extremely gifted she was really smart and excelled in her studies and she joined a lot of clubs and especially enjoyed helping others she was always the first to volunteer whenever we start any new projects principal pierce replied she sounds like a wonderful person hermione answered slowly i wouldntsay that i knew her personally at all but we did talk a few times principal pierce answered what did you guys talk about hermione asked curiously is it going to be off the record he asked of course hermione answered quickly well we really never talked about anything really important but just how she seemed to talk about these big dreams that she had these big dreams of being respected and where she would be remembered and recognized for who she was i told her that she was a smart girl and that i was sure that she would achieve her dreams she seemed kind of lonely because her parents were not around much while she was growing up or that is what she told me and i have found no reason to question that he explained that is quite fascinating i think that she may be well on her way she got into a great college hermione commented we were very proud of her as well when we heard that pierce replied i was wondering if you knew anything about the school she went to before this one hermione asked actually we didntknow much about the school but from some research we found that it is a well known boarding school and we read such good things about the school normally we didntaccept transfer students in their last year of school so we gave her placement tests to see for ourselves if she was up to our standards she aced all of the tests that we gave her and due to her great school record we didntto accept her and we ae glad that we did he answered why were you glad that she was accepted hermione asked curiously she has helped gain some attention she won numerous contests against other schools in the area principal pierce answered that great what was the name of the school hermione asked i believe the name of the school was faerway academy for the gifted principal pierce answered that is a school i haventheard of but it does sound special hermione commented jotting it down is there anything else you would like to know principal pierce asked what kind of classes did allie take hermione asked let me take a look principal pierce replied grabbing a folder from inside his desk and opening it here we are allie took a wide variety of classes this included ap chemistry and english drama criminology psychology history art writing photography and cooking principal pierce answered i d say that would be a lot of different classes hermione commented we were asking her that at first when she first picked those classes but she told us that she wanted to try out all the different types of classes and that she always took all these different classes at her old school so we decided to let her do so as long as she managed to do well in her required classes then we will let her do as she pleases principal pierce answered do you mind if i take a look at that hermione asked i sorry but it is still confidential and i cantlet you he replied apologetically i understand hermione replied disappointed do you have any other questions principal pierce asked have you heard anything interesting from the rest of the students regarding allie hermione asked do you mean if they talked about her why do you ask principal pierce asked i wanted to be thorough and wanted to know how her peers felt about her hermione answered smoothly i dontnormally know what the other students say unless i hear it in the form of a complaint which i never received he answered that okay is there anything you remember happening during the year she was here at school hermione asked alright then um well now that you mention it nothing really unusual but we did seem to have more strange occurrences at the school during her last year here principal pierce replied thoughtfully could you be more specific hermione prodded well we have a very low accidents rate at the school but there seemed to be more accidents during that year overall it was still a very small number but enough to catch my attention there was that one particular chemistry accident that occurred early on in her year during her class which was somewhat unusual we re still not sure what happened but nothing else happened besides that one incident in her class that we kind of forgot all about it at the end of the year he answered what kind of incident was it hermione asked actually i hardly remember it at all i just believe it happened during one of the labs principal pierce replied apologetically no thank you you ve been very helpful is it alright if i spoke to any of the teachers here hermione asked that no problem at all but none of the teachers that taught allie still teach at this school he explained not even one hermione asked quite shocked a lot of the teachers transferred to another school or moved away principal pierce answered is that normal hermione asked teachers transferring schools is definitely something that happens quite a bit but usually such a large number of teachers transferring from one school is not something happens ordinarily he answered did they all transfer after that year hermione asked not all of them a few each semester until all of them were gone i was actually quite surprised about a couple of teachers retiring i had no idea they wanted to retire but of course they had been teaching for quite a long time and deserve the time just to relax and enjoy life he answered thanks so much principal pierce hermione replied you re welcome jane he answered i trust that some of the things said will be kept away from the press principal pierce added dont worry you wontbe reading anything that you wouldntwant printed hermione assured him as she turned to walk away jane i still happen to have an old year book nearby would you like to take a look carolyn asked that would be great hermione added walking over and saw that carolyn was flipping through the pages of pictures of their graduates until she found the r where allie would be found ah there she is and pointed towards a different looking allie she had straight brown hair and small rimmed glasses and looked quite young by the end of the year she looked quite different she sort of reminds me of you when i first saw you i thought that you looked familiar but i was sure that i never met you before now i realize that you reminded me of allie carolyn explained what do you mean when you say that she looked different by the end of the year hermione asked carolyn wa s about the answer but the phone rang again so she said why dontyou flip through the book while i get the phone hermione sat down and flipped through the pages and found that allie was in a lot of the pictures because of the number of clubs she was in allie was always wearing a smile and next to a group of people but there always seemed to be some space between her and the rest of the group members it was the same for most of the group pictures except for one picture where she seemed to be happier and much more part of the group that was the picture of the drama club then she turned to the grad pictures and saw a much more confident looking allie with now brown hair that was sort of curly and no more glasses next to the valedictorian picture doesnt she look great carolyn asked she does and she made valedictorian hermione responded with a nod she was quite shocked when allie came to the school and got higher scores than she did and it was quite obvious that she would be made valedictorian she didnthave very many female friends carolyn answered she seemed to have gained a lot more confidence since the last picture that was took for the yearbook hermione commented at the beginning of the year she seemed more down in the dumps about things and didntreally fit in all that much but by the end of the year she seemed to have gained a lot of confidence and managed to make more friends then i thought could happen she thought of herself as a plain looking girl and not very popular and i guess she got over it with the help of her friends carolyn added i glad that it worked out for her hermione commented i glad you did too you really do remind me of her carolyn replied with a nod of her head do you mind if i take this she asked of course not i have a couple more copies carolyn answered hermione thanked her and headed out the door and looked at her watch and realized she was running a little behind schedule she would have to hurry back if she didntwant to be missed she quickly apparated back near the mansion where she knew there wouldntbe any people and walked slowly out to the back door and into the mansion where she noticed that nobody was there breathing a sigh of relief she headed back to her room in order to think she head learned a lot of things about allie from the meeting but a lot of those things that she learned would not be too useful to her and would not help her find out more about her secrets the first thing she needed to do though was find out more about the school that she went to and she needed to go take a look at her records somehow she walked over to her desk and opened her laptop and typed in the faerway school for the gifted she found that there wasntmuch information relevant to what she wanted to know about except this one link that could be useful the link opened a page that stated that the school is for special individuals only and that admission was difficult and would required both money and numerous tests before admission would be granted it had a long history about the founders of the school but no information of the topics the school specialized in or the teachers which she found to be really suspicious just then she heard a knock on the door and she opened it and saw lisa hi lisa hermione responded we just received another letter that is addressed to everyone so we all need to head downstairs lisa replied i ll be right down hermione responded and put away her computer in a safe place and locked it magically before heading downstairs so what in the letter hermione asked we were waiting for you to arrive first and now that you re here we can get started callie answered the letter read as follows dear lisa allie callie chloe christine and hermione i hope that all of you are well and have had a chance to get to know each of you the eliminations are now down to one by one as all of you have may guessed there have been a lot of changes happening in the bachelor as now there are only 6 ladies left and i very happy to have met you all the rose ceremony is set for later tonight which means the final group date is always for this evening and will be with lisa and chloe i look forward to seeing the two of you tonight and i wish that we had more time to spend together but i sure that it will be time well spent love harry the ceremony is tonight that is quite fast but good chloe added that way we wonthave to wonder who will get eliminated later on callie added do you guys have any ideas as to who he will eliminate hermione asked wanting to know the other girls thoughts on the subject it would be hard to say right now since he hasntreally spent that much time with any of us especially unless maybe you hermione but then he didntpick you for the individual date so i really have no idea christine replied lisa and chloe then excused themselves to go upstairs to get ready for their dates but before chloe headed upstairs she turned towards hermione i think that the person most likely to get kicked off would be probably lisa or callie because they didntreally seem to do anything to get their attention and harry didntseem to into either of them allie seems to have captured his attention though i d be wary of her chloe whispered to her what did chloe talk to you about allie asked nothing really important she just wanted to talk to me about some of the research that i do hermione answered sweetly i didntknow she was interested in that kind of stuff allie commented well i didnteither but it turns out she does want to know hermione replied with a shrug well then sometimes people turn out surprising you so what are your thoughts on the eliminations allie asked well since i not harry i wouldntknow hermione answered quickly i know that you are a girl after all and it impossible to be at two places at one time right allie asked of course it is hermione answered confused i just wanted to know what your thoughts are on the other girls allie replied i think that they are all really nice and that they all have an equal chance at getting to stay hermione answered i know they all are and it would be really hard to single any one person out but we re friends right allie asked sure we ll all friends here hermione commented i really glad to hear that because i really admire you hermione and i so glad that we are friends because i think of you as one of my good friends and i would be really sad if you were the next one to leave but judging from the way the two of you interact i think that would be really unlikely allie replied i would be sad to see you go as well hermione replied through a forced grin now that i know that we are friends who do you think should go next i promise that i wontbreathe a word to the other ladies allie tried once again i really have no idea hermione replied nonchalantly stop being so diplomatic hermione i know you dontwant to bad mouth anybody but we are in a competition with everyone to get harry attention there must be someone here that you would want to be out so that they wontbe competition anymore you do want to be with harry dontyou allie urged of course i do why else would i be here allie i really dontknow because everyone here has such great qualities about them but i d have to say that maybe the one that will go i guess will be someone who hasntbeen pulling enough weight around here hermione replied i feel the same way hermione i guess that would mean it would be either lisa or chloe then huh allie replied why them hermione asked well he didntpick them for the first group date allie replied simply nice chatting with you allie but i have some things to finish up upstairs hermione replied still working i see dontwork too hard allie replied with a wave hermione walked upstairs to her room and shook her head allie is so frustrating why does she seem so intent on being my friend and asking me so many questions she thought to herself harry arrived at the mansion to meet lisa and chloe for the group date he rang the doorbell once again hoping the see hermione the door opened and there she stood looking lovely in a sleeveless blouse and mid length skirt hermione he said hi harry hermione replied and started to turn around but he grabbed her wrist we really are okay right harry asked we are i told you that already hermione answered but i feel like you re being distant and i dontwant to lose you harry replied you re not going to lose me we really are okay you re my best friend and always will be hermione told him with a smile and squeezed his hand and if you need anything you know that you can tell me right harry added i know hermione replied and walked away in a couple of minutes lisa and chloe headed down the stairs and greeted him with a smile hello ladies ready to go harry asked absolutely they said together and headed out the door where are we going lisa asked well from what i am told we are going to learn to do something new and it will be hands on harry answered ah so we re probably making something right chloe asked yes we are going to learn how to make pottery harry answered i ve always wanted to do that lisa exclaimed then it ll be fun harry replied it does sound fun chloe replied i have actually not done this either so it will be new to me as well harry answered a potter not knowing how to make pottery that is quite shocking lisa teased him i quite shocked myself but then i not that kind of potter harry replied with a grin leave it to the producers to set you up for that one chloe added rolling her eyes it was just so obvious someone had to say it lisa replied smiling so how was the rest of your day harry asked it was good not that much to do since we re on vacation but i did get caught up on some writing lisa commented i agree but we are regularly kept busy with a lot of work that needs to be done before the show gets shown on television what about you chloe replied i have been pretty busy myself but not the same kind of busy that i am used to harry replied so tell us more about your life back home lisa asked there is a lot of stuff that is classified and i canttell you but what i can tell you that it requires a lot of hard work long hours and it also requires a lot of patience but in the end it is really worth it harry answered it must really be rewarding when you catch the criminals and see them brought to justice chloe commented it really is rewarding and a great feeling but it is more dangerous that i would like harry added is it something that is really important to you lisa asked i do love my job and i love helping keeping the country safe harry answered after a moment so that would mean it would be important for the woman that you spend your life with to understand that it is something that you love to do and support you lisa replied so do you guys think you two could harry asked i really think that i would support it because it is important to you and i would want you to be happy even it is dangerous chloe answered i feel the same way yes i not saying that it would be easy to do or that in a moment of anger that it wontcause any problems but yes i would be supportive because obviously your job means a lot to you and its an important part of your life i have the feeling that you wouldntbe you if you werentthis way lisa spoke up i give off that kind of air harry asked you do have the whole justice vibe going for you and i think it a great feeling to accomplish something and to help keep families together would be extremely satisfying chloe added that what one of my best friends always telling me harry added with a slight grin you mention this best friend of yours a lot that person must be really important to you lisa commented she is she just always been there for me she always been supportive of me and my career and i ve always been thankful for that harry answered with a smile just the driver announced that they had arrived and they got out of the limo and headed inside you must be mr potter and they must be lisa and chloe my name is marilyn the older woman said it nice to meet you harry replied shaking her hand has any of you thrown a pot before she asked everyone shook their heads alright then how about we learn or try to make a bowl or plate and see how that goes and dontworry if it doesntend up being functional it takes a lot of practice and hard work to make anything functional marilyn told them the three of them took their seats and put on the aprons that lay before them and faced the teacher alright guys things will get a bit messy so that is why we have the aprons for you so that you dontmess up any of your clothes what we have here is a pottery wheel and this is the equipment that is used to help you shape your ball of clay into whatever you want it to be the ones we will be using will be powered by a wheel that you guys will pedal first take a ball of clay and make sure your hands are a bit moist so that they clay will be damp and make it easier to shape them now first we must form the base shape for our object by forming coils like this and fixing this on top of our ball of clay that needs to be in the shape that we want it to be like a ball we need it to look like what the object we want to look like then we place the ball of clay on the disk of plastic called the bat on the turntable she explained harry thought that didntsound to hard so he used his hands to form a shape of a bowl and then he made a coil to sit on top of it and found that it wouldntstick harry i think that needs to be attached and what exactly are you making lisa asked curiously i knew that and i trying to make a bowl he answered with pride okay then lisa said with a teasing tone to her voice which cause harry to look towards her he saw lisa bowl and found that it seemed to be a good sized bowl which looked fancier than his in fact it was beginning to look more lopsided to him now i thought you never did this before chloe commented to lisa i haventbut i have always wanted to do it so i have read on it a bit and i a fast learner lisa answered chloe nodded and continued creating her bowl base which also looked more like a bowl than harry did okay now is everyone ready to try to wheel she asked they all nodded and gently placed their creation on the bat of the turntable harry took a breath and pressed the pedal a little bit and placed his hands on his bowl as instructed it felt very wet and slimy he tried to create a more thin edge but he couldntseem to get one side to match the other and ended up to be a bit lopsided good try mr potter not bad for a first try marilyn told him kindly he turned to see lisa doing a much better job with her hands it really began to look like a bowl he was very impressed yet embarrassed himself lisa this is great work the dimensions are not quite right but it does look like it will stand on its own an excellent job marilyn told her with a smile that awesome lisa harry told her can i let you in on a little secret lisa asked i kind of lied just a little bit although i have never actually done this i have seen my friends do it many times so this is completely new to me lisa confessed but just watching them do it and actually doing it are completely different things so you do deserve the credit harry told her with a smile that is true but let just say that my friend didnthave any better luck than you on their first try so you shouldntfeel so bad about it lisa answered harry smiled in return touched by her intent to make him feel better and replied well i just like any other average guy then you re a good guy and definitely not average but there is one area that you definitely do need some help in lisa teased him and what is that harry asked you need to learn when to ask for help when you obviously need it and you need to learn to wash your hands before touching your face lisa replied giggling what harry asked and went to look in the mirror and saw that he had clay in his hair he turned and walked back out and said you think that funny keep your hands to yourself mister lisa replied backing away harry caught up to her easily and placed his hands in her hair that is not fair you re obviously faster than me lisa said facing him before touch her hand on his face and smiled you will pay for that harry replied following her into the classroom where they stopped when they saw chloe how is your pot going chloe lisa asked stepping farther away from harry why dontyou take a look chloe answered gesturing towards her bowl chloe also turned out a little bit flat as her wheel moved a little too quickly causing her to push a little too hard towards her bowl nice try chloe this happens to a lot of beginners marilyn replied they do chloe asked slightly embarrassed it does this is a tough skill and has a really deep learning curve with practice i sure that it will work out great for you marilyn answered warmly and turned to lisa and harry why donti show you where the kiln is marilyn told them and lead them over to the kiln where she to put their creations and continued this is where the firing stage occurs allows the pots to become impervious to liquid and which allows them to be used as dishes it takes around 5 hours so you wontbe able to take them home today that totally fine lisa told her with a smile as the headed back to their room and saw chloe working on her piece at the wheel this time having a much better result that looks great harry commented to her thanks i definitely learned from last time about putting too much pressure on the bowl chloe replied with a smile i knew you could do a better job chloe i will put in this in the kiln for you while you go wash up we will send your items back to you tomorrow marilyn told them once they washed their hands they said their good byes to her and headed back towards to limo did the two of you have fun harry asked i did it was great to actually experience how some of the dinnerware that we use is made lisa answered it was pretty cool and it felt great to be able to create something like a bowl with our own hands i will definitely try this again when i get back home chloe replied i know that you had fun harry added gesturing to this hair it was not my fault that you didntremember that you hands were dirty lisa replied back that may be true but you didnthave to put some of it on my face harry added you totally started it and now i have some in my hair lisa shot back at him dont tell me it wasntfun harry replied raising his eyebrows it was fun lisa replied with a smile for once i was glad that i wasntpart of that chloe spoke up with a grin we dontwant to leave you out then lisa and harry exchanged a twisted grin what does that mean chloe replied suspicious and looking at the two of them why dontyou wait and see harry said with an evil grin they both then took out a bottle of silly string and shook it what do you think you re doing chloe asked we want you to join in on our fun lisa commented dont you guys dare chloe warned them and within a second she was covered in silly string that is totally not fair i am stuck in this car with nothing to arm myself chloe commented harry then handed her a bottle we got one for you too chloe took the can with a grin and shook it and on the count of three they all sprayed each other and they were all laughing and smiling that was fun totally juvenile but fun chloe commented i dontthink it was juvenile do you lisa asked harry nope definitely not harry replied with a grin you two chloe started and just started to laugh it was contagious and all three started laughing again we are a mess chloe said trying to get out as much of the silly string as possible before entering the mansion i am too why dontwe all go and clean up before the ceremony harry suggested that will be a good idea i had a great time harry lisa told him with a smile i had a great time too harry said giving both of them a hug see you inside chloe asked see you then harry said giving them a wink and his heart melting grin lisa and chloe arrived at the mansion with grins on their faces what happened to the two of you christine asked curiously we were just having some fun lisa replied as they both headed to their rooms to clean up when is the ceremony callie asked it will be in a little while we just need to clean up a bit chloe told her in about 15 minutes chloe and lisa headed back downstairs looking fresh and happy to join the rest of the ladies as they waited for harry arrival matthew was already there with the 5 remaining roses hermione waited anxiously for harry to arrive as she was unsure as to whether or not she would be asked to stay they had decided that she would leave during this ceremony or the next one as soon as harry decided that he didntneed her anymore at that thought hermione felt a twinge of sadness harry entered looking fresh and looked at all the wonderful ladies he had gotten to know and his eyes lingered on hermione she was probably nervous about his decision today he always loved seeing her flustered it was always rare for him to see and she looked very elegant today in her slip dress and her hair up in a loose wave welcome to tonight rose ceremony as you can see there are only 5 roses remaining i would like to congratulate you all for making it this far those of you who do not receiver a rose please make a quick goodbye and head back inside to pack your things matthew announced stepping back first of all i just want to say that every rose ceremony gets harder and harder for me to decide who to eliminate because all of you are incredible women and i have loved getting to know you all i know that i haventhad a chance to get to know all of you really well but i have enjoyed every moment i have spent with you harry began harry took his first rose and called out his first name chloe chloe smiled and stepped forward will you accept this rose harry asked chloe nodded and gave him a hug and walked back to her space harry took the next rose and called out the next name christine will you accept this rose harry asked of course i will christine replied with a smile and kissed him on the cheek lisa will you accept this rose harry asked lisa nodded and gave him a hug hermione will you accept this rose harry asked with a grin yes i would love to hermione replied with a smile and gave him a hug i still need you harry whispered into her ear hermione pulled away and kissed him on the cheek and grinned allie will you accept this rose harry asked of course i will allie replied giving him a hug and kiss callie you ve been really great but i just dontthink that we have enough in common to make it work it was a really tough decision and i want you to know that harry told her i understand i saddened by this and i thought that maybe it could work but i wish you all the best of luck callie told him and gave him a hug after callie left the remaining five ladies grabbed a drink and joined harry i really glad to get to know the rest of you even better harry told them as the clinked glasses a n thanks so much for all your amazing reviews you guys totally rock so surprise here is another chapter that i hope you all enjoy now i may post another chapter next week cantpromise you anything but the more reviews i get the more likely that it will happen so please review and hope that you enjoy oh and then my next chapter will not be til december after my nanowirmo break disclaimer i dontown anything chapter 18 hermione woke up the next morning feeling quite happy she was thrilled that she was still in the house and that he still needed her to be there it made her happy to know that he still trusted her opinion and still wanted to hear her thoughts on the remaining girls she was also happy for reasons she would never really admit to the fact that she was still there meant there was still a chance that he had feelings for her stop thinking like that he doesntlike you that way and never will she scolded herself gently and focused her energy back on the search for this school that allie came from she tried many different ways of searching for the school and all she got in search results was little mentions of the school for great achievement but there was no information on the school at all she was getting quite frustrated so she decided to search the web for any information on allie while she was at nyu at first all she got was articles on irrelevant events and then she finally found something of interest in a small independent newspaper dealing with a serious of unusual events happening at nyu hermione scanned through the article eagerly and found that it described a few incidents that involved people acting extremely strangely as if they were not themselves or some would even say possessed there were also a few disappearances mentioned but there was nothing connecting the disappearances with the strange behaviour so any investigation was dropped and missing persons reports were filed with the police so far none of these people have ever been found it also mentioned that allie had seen near these people around that time the events occurred she searched for contact information on the writer of the article and sent out an e mail asking for a response as soon as possible hermione then decided to head to the kitchen to get some food as soon as she realized that she hadnteaten anything all morning hello hermione chloe said hi chloe how are you doing hermione asked i doing really well how bout you chloe asked i good have we gotten the letter from harry yet hermione asked not yet but it should be soon christine commented hi christine hermione replied when she saw her good morning christine replied grabbing a glass of juice where have you been allie asked as she walked into the kitchen just a morning jog christine answered before taking a drink of orange juice i take morning jogs myself maybe next time we should go together allie commented sure i will let you know the next time i go for a job christine responded with a smile that ll be great lisa chloe and hermione do you want to join us as well allie asked that might be fun lisa answered i enjoy jogging so sure let make it a group activity chloe replied hermione wontyou join us allie asked sweetly sure it will be fun hermione answered as she looked at all of their faces and realized that with all of the info she was finding on allie that it would be a good idea to watch over her just then the phone rang and allie quickly rushed to answer it hello she said and her face smiled and they all knew immediately who it was allie smiled and nodded a couple of times and laughed before hanging up the phone so what did he say chloe asked well harry said for us to meet in about an hour where he will pick someone for an individual date allie answered with a smile we re meeting in an hour i need to hurry up and shower christine exclaimed heading upstairs i ve got to go and get ready as well lisa commented excusing herself i ve got to get ready too hermione said grabbing a pear and headed upstairs as soon as she got upstairs she checked her computer and realized that she got an e mail and checked it quickly the email read as follows thank you for your interest in this article the writer no longer works as this paper but this is her last know address e mail and phone number her name is joan randall and this would be her phone number 581 6245 yours truly adam kinsely editor independent times hermione quickly picked up the phone and left a message at the phone number mentioning that it was very important that she be called back as soon as possible she then walked over to her closet to pick out something to wear to the ceremony it took her quite a long time to pick something to wear that would make her look elegant yet simple as the same time she ended up picking out a light coloured cashmere sweater that hung of her shoulders and a mid length skirt and a matching belt she pulled her hair up in a clip and let her bangs fall softly on the side of her face she put on some light makeup to accentuate her eyes and a little mascara she also put on a little strawberry lip gloss then her phone started to vibrate and she picked up to answer hello hermione replied is this jane a voice asked yes this is she hermione answered softly i am joan randall and i received your message from a friend she answered thanks so much for responding to my message so quickly hermione replied eagerly she opened her door slightly and saw that nobody was around and silently cast a sound charm around her room to keep others from eavesdropping i was quite surprised to receive your call it has been a couple of years since i had written that article and i thought nobody remembered that i wrote it joan answered gently i know that it has been quite a long time but i was actually doing some research on allie myself and your article really intrigued me as it all sounded quite unbelievable hermione replied that what a lot of other people have told me about the article and i would have thought that way too if i hadntseen it for myself joan answered so could you give me more information on the kinds of events and who disappeared hermione asked eagerly well it was kind of strange because i just saw people that i knew everyday acting very differently it was almost if they were hypnotized they would do things that they normally wouldntdo joan explained what exactly do you mean hermione asked well one of them was this girl named sarah and she was normally kind of mean but not really mean just really proud of herself and scared a lot of people and then one day she was acting all smiling and courteous and really polite joan explained you just mean the change happened overnight and what does this have to do with allie hermione asked yeah just like that one day she was and one day she wasn t and this happened a day after she was supposed to meet allie allie told me that she never met her then but sarah was especially nice to allie joan explained this is really interesting was she always like that after that incident what about the disappearances hermione then asked well i dontreally know everything that happened she was like that for a couple of weeks and then she transferred schools or that is what i heard as for the disappearances they remain unsolved they havent been found yet except one person and there doesntseem to be any similarities between all the missing people except that they all knew allie oh and the one person they did find committed suicide or that is what the police decided happened joan explained you dontbelieve that it was a suicide hermione asked well i just dontbelieve that he would have committed suicide he just wasntthat kind of person joan replied so you knew him well hermione asked not really well i mean we were close in high school but not so much at nyu because we were pursing different fields joan explained do you have any research that you kept from the article hermione asked just then she thought she heard something moving outside her room can you hold a moment please she asked sure joan answered hermione put down the phone and opened the door and saw nothing outside the door and grabbed the phone again i really sorry about that i thought i heard something outside she explained that not a problem i actually do still have some of my research at home do you want me to drop if off for you joan asked no i actually not at home right now so you wontbe able to find me since i move around a lot why donti meet you somewhere hermione suggested looking at her watch sure jane you re staying in la right joan asked as a matter of fact i am why dontwe meet at the coffee shop on 3rd in about 2hours hermione asked alright i ll be there joan answered see you then hermione replied hanging up the phone with a smile then as she was heading towards the door she was a fly buzzing around and wondering how it got there and noticed that she had left the window open and quickly closed it and shooed the fly away she took a quick glance in the mirror and fixed her hair before heading downstairs and almost bumped into allie allie you scared me hermione told her after taking a deep breath i really sorry about that i was just in a hurry to get downstairs allie replied apologetic that okay i in a hurry as well hermione responded with a smile nice of you two to join us harry told them as he saw them come down the stairs with a twinkle in his eyes well you know how we like to keep guys waiting to make sure that we look our best hermione responded with a smile well you definitely look good harry complimented her and then added all of you do as he smiled at the rest of the group so do you the rest of the girls chimed together now that we are all here we can get started harry spoke up with as smile chloe nudged hermione and asked why were you so late i just had to take an important phone call hermione whispered back i want all of you to know that it has been quite difficult for me to pick just a couple of you to take on an individual date because i would love to take each of you out but as rules have it this is the way that the show is done so i will just announce my choices now because i know that you are all very anxious to know who i chose harry added everyone stood anxiously awaiting his decision my first choice for the individual date would be christine harry responded and handed her a rose christine accepted the rose happily and stepped into place my next choice would be lisa harry said and handed lisa a rose as she stepped forward lisa walked back to her place with a smile i chose the both of you because i believe that we didntspend enough time together and i would really like to harry told them with a smile and gave each of the girls a hug when he got to hermione he whispered in her ear can you meet me at my house in a few minutes hermione whispered back i will be there as soon as i can harry then waved a good bye and headed out the door congrats to both of you hermione told both of the eagerly i think it was really nice of him to pick me but i think it was because he felt that he didntspend enough time with us during the pottery date but we did have a lot of fun lisa replied nonsense he didntpick me or allie so he must like you better i must have that i am envious chloe commented thanks chloe i sure you will get your chance during your group date lisa replied christine i thrilled for you i knew he would pick you hermione told her with a smile i was quite sure he would have picked you hermione the two of you seemed like you were connecting christine told her well maybe we didn t hermione answered no i totally think that he likes you i want to tell you that i was always a little jealous of you because you seemed to connect with him so well you definitely watch your back after all we are after the same thing christine told her i know but i d like to think that we can all still get along hermione told her we all do but you know what i mean right christine asked i do and i agree that we canttrust everyone or we will get hurt hermione responded but i pretty sure that i can trust you though christine replied thanks it means a lot hermione told her giving her a hug i going to meet a friend for a bit i will be back soon hermione told everyone with a wave hermione wait up allie called allie what can i do for you hermione asked with a fake smile i was just wondering where you were going allie replied i told you i meeting a friend and running some errands hermione explained i need to buy something too why dontwe go together allie asked i sorry but i meeting my friend and we re going together and he doesntreally like surprises hermione explained well that alright then i ll see you later allie replied looking disappointed and quickly walked ahead of her hermione watched her form leave before heading off towards harry house and knocked on the door hermione glad you could make it you look lovely today harry commented thank you harry i hope you really mean it hermione teased him dont i always harry replied feigning hurt hermione gave him a knowing look i always mean what i say by the way that color really suits you harry replied firmly thanks harry but you also usually are especially nice if you want something so what is it potter hermione asked blushing i am offended even if you donttrust me you should at least have confidence in yourself harry told her shaking his head i do in fact i know that i look good but knowing you tells me otherwise hermione teased him i happen to mean what i say and i do want to ask you a little question harry told her i knew it hermione replied triumphantly i just wanted to ask you your thoughts on my choices and maybe what kind of date i should plan for the girls harry replied well i totally liked your choices for the date well christine is very cultured so i would think it would be great to do something much more cultured and elegant while lisa is much more casual so it wouldnt need to be fancy hermione answered do you have any suggestions he inquired you have a brain think of something yourself i mean you do have one right hermione asked him teasingly of course i do some friend you are harry responded with mock sadness dont even think about it i not doing your work for you anyways i think that they are both great and who do you like the most so far hermione asked well at least i tired and to answer your question i d have to say that i would pick christine allie and well you harry responded you included me in your list hermione asked puzzled well out of everyone you and i get along really well and of course i like you or else we wouldntbe best friends harry answered you know i didntmean like as in liking a friend i meant you as in more than a friend like hermione explained even so you would be there in the top of my list harry explained hermione blushed but then said really of course you re very important to me and no matter what happens i will always be there for you harry answered hermione smiled and gave him a hug thank you harry that means a lot because i wouldntwant anybody or anyone stop us from being friends hermione answered what wrong harry asked concerned you know how i told you about my suspicions about allie well i ve done some research and i found some very suspicious things about her i mean the school she went to faerway school for the gifted i couldntfind any information on the teachers or classes or where the school is it almost like it doesntreally exist in a way and then talking to the principal of the school she went to in her last year sounded quite suspicious a lot of accidents that were unexplained occurred and all the teachers that taught here are no longer at the school which was very strange even the principal thought so hermione replied what harry asked surprised and i also found this article written during the years she was at nyu and a lot of strange incidents also occurred and disappearances happened to people who had interactions with her and she really does worry me a little hermione continued so these incidents were linked to her harry asked not officially but judging from what other people have told me who were there at the time it certainly seems that way hermione explained and what kind of incidents were they harry asked well people were acting out of character some may even say possessed hermione explained well how do you know it was her for sure harry asked it not possible for so many coincidences to happen at one place and time beside the only thing those people had in common was that she talked to all of them and one of the people that disappeared committed suicide hermione explained well if that person committed suicide then how does that have anything to do with allie harry asked i was talking to someone who knew that person and they said that they would not commit suicide hermione replied hermione it not that i dontwant to believe you because i know that you would never like and that you area looking out for me but you dont have any proof and they could all be coincidences and even so to me all it tells me is that maybe allie is not your average muggle after all harry suggested even so dontyou find it strange that all the teachers who taught her disappeared hermione asked i dontknow but even if you point something like that out all it says is that maybe allie is a witch and that wouldntbe a bad thing would it harry asked but this means maybe she isnta good person or a good witch and that isnta good thing is it furthermore it would mean that she would be lying about who she really is hermione replied but then again arentyou harry gently reminded her yes i am but all of these strange incidents and disappearances don t follow me around hermione reminded him no they don t what you have said is quite interesting and i will totally keep that in mind but have you thought about whether or not she is a witch or not harry asked but then she would know me and you and then she would know that i just your friend and maybe that would explain some things but still all of these bad things occurring near her really worries me hermione replied in restrospect harry gave her a hug and said dontthink so much about it maybe you re over thinking it so you really dontbelieve me hermione asked with a frustrated tone in her voice and a hint of sadness that not true hermione i do believe you but you haventgiven me anything to go on and i would like to think that the person is innocent until proven guilty i know you believe in that too harry said i do but i just have a feeling about her and its not good why dont come with me hermione asked come with

started you canthandle to truth about allie you re afraid that you re wrong hermione asked challenging him of course not i can handle anything after voldemort harry answered of course the great harry potter isntafraid of anything he the boy who lived and killed one of the darkest wizards of all time hermione teased him rolling her eyes and dontyou forget it harry said playfully winking at her there goes that ego again i think i going to go now hermione replied walking out the door where do you think you re going harry asked pulling on her arm i going to leave you and ego alone i dontthink the house has enough room for it hermione teased him i not going to let you get away with that harry replied chasing after her hermione ducked and rang up the stairs quickly and she saw that he had disappeared and then when she turned around he was right there that is no fair who said you could use magic hermione asked you never mentioned that before harry replied spraying her with some whip cream i so getting you for that hermione replied and apparated down to the kitchen and grabbed a can of whip cream and hid until she saw harry and the sprayed him in the face and heard to yell hermione fell back laughing i cantbelieve an auror such as yourself would scream like a girl i do not scream like a girl harry answered defensively i never heard any guy scream when sprayed in the face hermione replied laughing harry started to chase after her and easily caught up with her and started to tickle her and carried her in the air until she said truce i call a truce now are you going to behave he asked yes i will hermione promised catching her breath okay then harry asked putting her back down so you ready to go hermione asked sure harry replied as he grabbed a jacket and headed out the door remember to keep an open mind and stop being so sceptical hermione reminded him okay i promise i will keep an open mind harry answered hermione and harry waited outside the coffee shop for a good hour and nobody showed up so hermione tried calling her number and it rang a few times before someone picked it up then she heard some glass breaking and then a voice that sounded like joan answered hello joan it me where are you hermione asked i really sorry but i had a lead come up and i cantmeet you today joan replied are you okay hermione asked i fine but i may have caught a little cold though can we set up another meeting joan asked sure maybe tomorrow hermione asked and heard some thumping that will be great joan answered is everything okay i hear a lot of noises hermione asked that just my neighbour so i ll see you tomorrow joan asked that ll be great hermione replied perplexed you want to go somewhere with me hermione asked where do you want to go harry asked i want to pay a friend a visit hermione told him joan harry asked i just have this feeling hermione replied you have her address harry asked i just want to take a little peep hermione replied and gave him the address and they looked around quickly and saw nobody there so they apparated down to a street near joan house hermione walked towards the house and noticed that it was a rather nice neighbourhood and knocked on the door and nobody answered the door the room looked really clean except her desk it seemed to be extremely messy she found the door unlocked so she walked in to find a young women lying on the floor and she decided to shake her she didntnotice anybody else in the room or any dishes which she found suspicious since she heard the sound of glass breaking on the phone joan hermione asked gently shaking her who are you she asked confused it me jane i called you before this is my friend harry she answered motioning to harry oh right i do remember you we were supposed to meet right joan asked but what were you asking me about again joan asked that story you wrote while in nyu about some strange incidences hermione asked her a little perplexed i dontreally remember writing one about strange incidences joan answered confused that impossible you told earlier that you did write it hermione replied i did joan answered are you okay hermione asked i must have fallen down pretty hard then my memory is a little fuzzy what are you here for again joan asked apologetically you had some research that you wanted to show me hermione reminded her gently all my research is sitting on my desk you can take a look if you would like joan told her hermione and harry looked over the papers in her desk and found nothing dealing with nyu on her desk or her computer is your desk always this messy hermione asked when i doing research is it quite messy but i still have a system joan replied you do hermione asked well yes it messy but i can find what i need because all related stores are filed together joan explained hermione looked around and noticed that although it was messy there were still some stories that didntreally seem to be related as if they were deliberately place there but she didntsay anything sorry for bothering you thanks anyway hermione told her as she and harry walked back out and almost tripped on something and found that it was a tiny mouse and it quickly scampered away so what are you thinking harry asked knowingly well i just found the whole thing really strange you know how she couldntremember the story she wrote and finding her on the floor i mean dontyou hermione asked i do find that especially strange but doesntmean it has to do with allie harry reminded her but the story is about allie so it does concern her hermione added i think that we could continue to investigate though if you need help i will definitely be willing to help harry replied gently squeezing her shoulders glad to hear it i do you need your help for something though hermione replied after a thought what did you think of harry asked noticing her brightened expression i need to get a look at her school records but i need someone to get it while i distract the principal hermione explained i can definitely do it sounds fun like during hogwarts but it will have to wait i have to get back because i still have a lot of things to do for later harry told her and walked off giving her a quick kiss on the cheek hermione smiled and looked back on the house as the wheels in her head started churning again what happened over here and who did it she thought to herself disclamer i dontown harry potter or abc they belong to jkr please review or i wontupdate anymore chapter 2 first meeting the host of the show named mathew came over to harry and said okay are you ready to meet these lovely ladies as ready as i ll ever be harry said putting on a smile alright then he said and headed over to the producers to tell them that he was ready harry took a deep breath before he headed over to the spot that was near the door where he was going to greet each woman as she arrived he was feeling more nervous than normal although he never liked the attention he had received since he was 11 it was something that he was used to he also wasntnervous about whether or not the woman will like him he may not be the most handsome guy around but he knew from experience that he was considered an attractive man and he knew that what he was nervous about was the decisions he would have to make tonight what if he made the wrong cuts tonight it would be hard to get to know any of these women in the time he was allowed he would just have to trust his instincts which have not let him down much these last few years after a few minutes the first contestant arrived she had on a flattering blue dress that complimented her figure well hi my name is lisa she said offering her hand towards me nice to meet you lisa i replied with a smile and kissed her hand the pleasures mine lisa answered with a grin harry met and greeted each of these women in a similar way and noticed that they were all beautiful women and seemed really nice but some of them were wearing more makeup than he would have liked finally the last woman to arrive was the one he most wanted to see but the sight that came to him literally took his breath away hermione came down looking more beautiful than he could possibly of imagined her hair was put up in an elegant style of soft curls surrounding her face highlighting the softness of her features she was wearing just a touch of makeup that accentuated her eyes cheeks and her soft lips she was wearing an elegant lavender gown that was very flattering to her curves and high heels harry was mesmerized by the beauty in front of him and was brought back out of his trance by her voice i hermione she answered with a twinkle in her eye its really nice to meet you you look amazing hermione wow harry complimented in a deeper voice than normal thanks hermione responded with a blush and then whispered nervously i cantbelieve i doing this i hope i wontwreck this for you you won t you have never let me down have you harry whispered no hermione answered with a smile go knock them dead harry added hermione just laughed and headed over to join the rest of the girls after taking a breather he headed over to join the girls who all

explained okay harry nodded the girls apparently separated into little groups talking amongst each other while waiting for harry once matthew left harry took a breath a smiled and walked over to one group of ladies hi mind if i join you harry asked of course not one of girls said first of all i would like to tell how honored i am to be spending time with all you beautiful ladies why dontwe take

hitting truth try to get the facts that the public has a right to know stephanie responded with a smile that sounds like a lot of hard work harry commented it is sometimes but its what i like to do stephanie answered harry then turned to the last girl and said with a smile what about you well my name is callie stuart and i work in law enforcement callie explained really mind if i ask what branch of it do you work harry asked intrigued looking at the cute browned hair woman in front of him right now i work at a police force dealing in gang activity i actually want to get into the fbi callie

make a difference and that what i do is important callie answered honestly before being cut off i know the same feeling that is one of the reasons that i got into being a reporter to give the people the real story stephanie added rude much lisa asked excuse me stephanie asked well did you even see if callie was done talking lisa asked raising her eyebrow well she sounded like she was werentyou callie stephanie asked well if you ask her like that of course she ll say not lisa argued now who being rude let callie answer for herself stephanie answered back and turning to callie callie looked back and forth between the two not knowing how to answer harry looked in amusement as he watched the argument between the ladies isabelle took the opportunity to touch harry arm and asked care for some fresh air harry nodded and they headed out the door to the garden outside that was filled with flowers and the night sky was clear and filled with stars katie tracy and christine noticed harry slipping out with a red haired woman katie turned to the other girls and said i cantbelieve she did that who does she think she is if they re not back in 5 minutes then we re going to raid their little party meanwhile hermione was watching across the woman and noticed that harry was talking with a group of ladies and decided that she would have to somehow get to know all of these women in order to help harry out a couple of ladies came over and said hey i chloe and this is jennifer the brunette said with an exotic look and handed her a drink hi i hermione hermione responded taking the drink it nice to meet you jennifer responded with a warm smile so how did you end up here hermione asked i was just telling jennifer here that i was tired of all the losers that i ve been dating most of the guys i dated arentinterested in a long term relationship or just arentthat material the last guy i dated was just so infuriating when i asked him about the future he was like why do you want to ruin what we have right now let just take it one day at a time chloe answered really that is nothing though the last guy i met was like all over me with the come one baby let make beautiful music together and i like excuse me do i know you and he like yeah in your dreams and when i was walking away he kept and talking to me i was just thinking cantyou get it in your head that i dontlike you

how much time i was spending with my best friend who a guy hermione answered sounds like a jerk chloe commented let drink to that jennifer responded raising her glass hermione and chloe joined in on the toast so isabelle what else do you like to do harry asked as she sat down on the bench well i actually work at a bank as a financial advisor but i love the martial arts because it helps you stay

sadness in her eyes i know what you mean i never knew my parents but i really do miss them harry responded and they shared a knowing look katie led the other girls out and spotted harry immediately she asked quickly do you mind and sat down excuse me but we were having a private conversation isabelle protested as you can see there are a lot of us that still haventhad our chance to speak to harry yet i dontthink its fair that you get a lot of one on one time with him katie answered a n thanks to all my lovely reviewers sorry for the long wait please review disclaimer i dontown anything chapter 20 hermione woke up to the sound of tapping on the window with a start she slowly got up and grabbed something hard that she could use to protect herself and proceeded very slowly toward the window and slowly moved towards the window to see if she could catch a glimpse of the person behind the window but the person seem to be very well concealed because she couldntcatch a glimpse of the invader hermione took a deep breath and slowly opened the window with her wand while she stood a safe distance away slowly the black figure entered the room and she braced herself so that she would be ready for an attack and swiftly moved closer to the attacker and asked who are you is that the way you treat a friend a familiar voice responded harry hermione murmured and punched him hard on the shoulder ouch you shouldntbe so rough hermione or else you will never get a boyfriend harry teased her hermione gave him a very dirty look and punched him in the ribs again i am just trying to help you harry replied with a smirk hermione drew out her wand and pointed it straight at him and said you want to keep your limbs hermione you know that i was just teasing you and put her wand down harry replied nervously i know but as usual you are taking things much too far and i wanted to make sure you still have some senses hermione replied sweetly putting down her wand thank you so much for your concern then harry answered with a fake smile i just being a good friend what are you doing here hermione asked i came here to talk to you about my date last night harry replied i know that it went pretty well christine looked quite happy when she came back last night hermione told him with a small smile she came by to talk to you harry inquired yeah just for a second so where did you take her hermione asked then it looks like the two of you are friends then i didntreally take her anywhere really special i just took her to this place that did parties where the servers wore traditional clothing and served traditional food harry answered christine is a really nice girl and i like her and your date seems like quite fun hermione replied we had a great time and she actually opened up to me about her past boyfriend i feel like she is really starting to let go of her past harry added so how do you feel about her hermione asked softly i think that christine is an amazingly talented girl and is really nice and sweet girl i think that we are both similar and different in many ways i feel like we really do connect and that there is definitely something special about her and i would like to get to know her a little bit better harry told her honestly she is really nice and sweet i glad that you re getting along so do you think that she could be the one hermione asked with both curiosity and dread i dontreally know but i do think that it is possible that she could be the one but i definitely need to spend some more time with her before i would know for sure harry added that true you want to be sure about things before making any final decisions hermione commented i also wanted to tell you that i sorry about how i reacted about allie harry told her after some thought really hermione asked amused i am after everything that we have been through i should know better than to dismiss any of your ideas or thoughts harry said to her how sorry are you hermione asked i really sorry and i know that i shouldnthave doubted you harry responded well i still actually mad at you though hermione answered you are harry inquired of course i am like you said i ve always been there for you and you go and doubt my judgement hermione replied with a glare and stifle a giggle you have always been there for me harry replied exactly and how many times have i been right hermione prompted more times than i can count harry mumbled if you know that then why would you doubt my judgement hermione asked in mock anger i sorry i had a momentary lapse of judgement you know that you are one of my best friends right harry answered i wouldntdoubt any of my best friends hermione retorted no no matter how upset you are you have always been there for me even when you thought that some of my plans were a little risky harry replied hermione turned away with mock anger and pretended not to pay any attention to him as he proceeded closer to her come on hermione i know that you have such a big and forgiving heart and would forgive me for my lapse in judgement harry pleaded wit her softly hermione pretended not to hear him and turned away what can i do to get your forgive me harry asked that depends on your sincerity then hermione answered after a moment i have a lot of sincerity harry replied with a nod well then let test that sincerity now hermione added and turned around okay what can i do harry asked seriously first of all i want you to bark like a dog hermione commanded do i really have to harry asked hermione gave him a look and harry got down on all fours ruff ruff harry said that a good start but why dontyou behave more like a dog hermione asked with a laugh harry started kneeling down on the ground and proceeded to walk on all fours and did so while barking and proceeded to move closer to the hermione and grabbed a hold of her leg what are you doing hermione replied shaking him off her leg i acting like a dog who really wants to be with his owner harry commented what kind of dog are you hermione hissed at him a scottish terrier harry commented why dontyou let go of my leg hermione asked trying to walk away i will as long as you forgive me harry told her that is such a cheap trick hermione told him will it work harry asked hopefully with puppy dog eyes darn his puppy dog eyes hermione thought to herself if you werentbigger than me i wouldntgive in so quickly hermione responded then you forgive me harry asked i do hermione added with a shrug look dontbe so angry with me i promise you that i will be wary of allie and i will keep my distance from her until we finally know everything there is to do about allie harry told her really you will take my opinion more to heart right hermione asked yes i promise harry told her seriously well then if that is true then i will forgive you hermione said playfully with a smile you really have a beautiful smile harry told her be serious hermione told him playfully swatting him in his arm i am serious harry answered walking towards her slowly i told you to be serious hermione added believe me when you smile you definitely brighten up my day harry added hermione just smiled and laughed and proceed to walk away but felt his hand grabbing a hold of her wrist what do you want hermione asked i just want you to follow me harry answered okay you got my curiosity hermione told her harry nodded and turned away and proceeded to lead the way hermione followed and turned towards the direction that he is pointing and harry led her towards a clearing where breakfast was laid on a large breakfast on a lovely table cloth what is this hermione asked with a large smile breakfast harry replied when did you plan this hermione replied sitting on the ground i just wanted to do something to show my appreciation and it took a few days of planning harry answered you knew that i would forgive you hermione asked i really hoped you would harry answered this really is a lovely setting for breakfast hermione said in awe of her surroundings as she took in the beautiful trees and the small creek with a bridge it is isntit i knew that you would enjoy the scenery harry responded and you wanted me to see it hermione asked of course and of course i just wanted to spend some more alone time with you too harry added that is really sweet of you hermione commented anything for my best friend harry mentioned let see what we have here hermione said looking around at the place settings why dontyou start with some orange juice harry asked handing her a glass hermione took the glass with a smile and took a sip and replied freshly squeezed orange juice just the way i like it i know harry said with a smile what else do you know hermione asked in a teasing tone well i know that you like to eat buttered toast harry said as he piled some toast on a plate and offered it to her hermione rolled her eyes and placed some eggs and bacon on a plate and offered it towards harry you remembered harry said taking the plate of course your taste hasntchanged since we went to hogwarts hermione reminded me that quite true harry commented so what are your plans for today hermione asked well i taking lisa out this afternoon for our individual date and i have to do some studio things as well what about you harry answered taking a bite of the egg i probably just going to hang out with the other girls a bit today and there this one other thing that i have to tell you hermione replied after some thought what is it harry asked well i did some digging yesterday and i found something else out hermione replied and what did you find out harry inquired well i found out that allie was doing quite a bit of research of me hermione added what harry asked shocked yeah she had these files on me from when i went to muggle school and some articles about me after i graduated from hogwarts hermione replied that really is suspicious behaviour did you notice anything else harry asked curiously well while i was doing some surveillance i noticed that she was talking to a cloaked dark figure that seemed to be floating hermione added did you catch a glimpse of the floating figure harry inquired i tried to but i couldntat all see who are what it was hermione replied now allie is beginning become more and more of a mystery that needs to be solved harry added she is becoming too much of a mystery and i really want to know why she is researching me hermione replied frustrated i have no doubt that you will figure out the mystery after all you are the smartest witch of our year harry replied you really think so hermione added of course i do i have total faith in you i know that you can do it harry added thank you hermione told him with a big smile is there anything i can do to help harry asked softly taking her hand all i need for you is to support me and be there for me if i need help hermione asked of course i will always be there if you need me harry replied you better keep your word then hermione said with a smile i always keep my word harry said i know hermione said with a smile now why dontyou eat and stop trying to act all ladylike harry commented with a sly grin earning a dirty look from hermione excuse me but isntthat like the pot calling the kettle black hermione asked what do you mean harry retorted it not at all like you act at all gentleman like you talk with your mouth full and you dontat all have very good table manners and you show no chivalrous tendencies you dontopen doors you show up uninvited and it really hard to take you anywhere without worrying about you embarrassing me i dontsee how any of these girls actually like you hermione commented i haventseen any complaints yet harry replied with a smirk oh i beg to differ it not like something they would say to you but it is definitely something they would mention to me though hermione retorted back they actually said something to you harry asked maybe hermione replied with a smirk what exactly did they say harry inquired you dontexpect me to tell you do you hermione asked of course i do harry replied now normally i would tell you but you cantexpect me to betray their confidence do you hermione answered well did they actually tell you not to tell me harry asked no but they obviously wouldntwant me to tell you what they tell me in private secondly i already lying to them about being your friend and i just dontwant to lie anymore than i have to you understand right hermione asked i do understand and i dontwant to make things any harder for you than it already is harry said nudging her i glad that you understand but you have something that you want to ask me dontyou hermione mumbled i know that i cantfool you i was wondering if it was possible if you could put in a good word for me harry inquired what exactly would you want me to say about you hermione asked i just want you to tell them the truth harry stated you want me to tell them that you have an enormous ego and think of yourself very highly hermione inquired how many times do i have to tell you that what i have is a lot of self confidence and it has nothing to do with having a large ego at all and i also donthave an enormous ego harry answered i dontunderstand why we keep on having to play this game hermione asked what game is that harry asked the one where you never admit that you have an ego and i retort back when we both know that i am right hermione responded you are right about a lot of things but there is something that you are wrong about though harry asked what have i been wrong about hermione whispered back well how about the time during second year when you assumed the form of a cat harry asked that was an accident the potion worked didntit hermione protested it did but you couldnttell the difference between human and cat hair harry replied it was a mistake but it doesntmean that i am wrong hermione replied with a smirk fine how about the time that you thought that you saw a gnome but it was actually a statue harry asked okay that was a small minor error hermione answered a little flushed how about the time that you thought that draco used harry started okay okay i get your point i have made a few mistakes but i never said that i was perfect hermione answered as she threw a grape at him testy now arentwe harry teased her if we are going to play this game then maybe should list all the times you were wrong hermione added with an innocent smile i harry started before he was interrupted by the sound of the phone ringing who is it hermione asked quietly the producer harry answered as he answered the phone hermione took a minute to take a look at the time and noticed that it was already 10 00 am and jumped up with a start i ll be right there harry said before hanging up i ve got to get going too why didntyou tell me how late it was getting hermione asked him i sorry but we just got talking and having such a good time that i forgot to check the time harry replied i had fun too hermione replied softly with a smile we should do it again some other time harry asked definitely but we better keep track of the time next time i dontwant to get caught hermione answered just tell them that we were having a secret meeting for the show harry told them i dontmean them hermione told him are the other girls giving you a hard time harry asked concerned well most of them dontbut allie has been getting on my case and i think that some of that suspicion has rubbed off on the other girls if i not always around hermione explained take care and be careful harry told her giving her a quick hug i will you d better get back too and be careful hermione replied i always am harry told her i mean it dontdo anything rash hermione responded and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and with a wink apparated back to the house harry smiled and touched his cheek before heading back to his place to meet with a couple of press associates hermione came out slowly of an empty bedroom and walked back quietly into her room and quickly changed before heading back downstairs hi girls hermione greeted everyone hermione want some juice lisa asked with a smile sure hermione answered taking the glass we were looking for you earlier if you wanted to join us for a morning swim and you werentin your room where were you chloe asked when i got up in the morning i received a call from a friend who really needed to talk so i had to go out for a bit hermione explained was it a girl or a guy allie asked why does it matter hermione replied sharply dontbe like that hermione i just reminding you that it is against the rules

answered getting up come on you can tell us more we are friends now right allie asked i sorry but i dontwant to say any more christine added apologetically how about what you guys talked about allie tired one more time mainly just about family christine answered relenting a little and quickly got up to avoid any more questioning allie was about to follow but hermione tapped her shoulder i think that she wants a bit of privacy hermione told her but dontyou guys want to know more allie asked of course we do but we need to respect the fact that she doesntwant to tell us more chloe answered give her some privacy allie and sit down lisa commented allie turned back around and sat down in defeat and drank some juice and chatted with chloe hermione finished her glass of juice and turned around to go back upstairs and headed back to her room a few minutes later there was knock on her door and she went to open it hi hermione do you have a few minutes free allie asked sure what do you have in mind hermione asked hermione i happened to walk by this clearing and i thought i saw someone that looks like you with this guy but i didnthappen to see his face and i was wondering if that was you

fimly okay i glad allie replied with a smile and headed for the door allie i was planning to go shopping for some clothes you want to come hermione asked after a moment i would love to allie replied as she left the room hermione took a deep breath and decided that the best course of action was to keep a closer eye on allie in order to figure out how her mind actually works and decided that she needed to ask more girls to go with them to make it more of a group outing and quickly glanced around her room quickly cast another magical charm around her room silently before heading out the door she saw chloe walking in the hall way and waved for her to come on over what going on chloe asked i was planning to go shopping for some new dresses with allie and i was wondering if you wanted to join us hermione asked i love shopping so definitely count me in chloe replied with a smile what are we chatting about christine asked we re talking about going shopping want to come hermione asked sure i do need another dress christine answered just then the doorbell rang and lisa rushed to open it in the letter came a note addressed to lisa dear lisa i looking forward to seeing you this afternoon i hope that you are ready for a nice casual evening out so be ready for a relaxing evening see you soon harry i like that it going to be casual but i have no idea what to wear lisa exclaimed as she hurried upstairs i hope it goes well for her christine spoke up with a smile you re one of the few people that i actually believe really means that allie commented what is that supposed to mean chloe asked it just that since we are all vying for harry affection i find it strange that all of you would want the others to do well and it seems a little bit forced allie answered what about you then allie how do you feel chloe replied well i want lisa do have a good time allie replied well then doesntthat make you fake chloe asked but i really mean it unlike some people allie replied sweetly did you mean me chloe pointedly asked i didntsay it was you allie replied cheerfully and headed upstairs i dontunderstand her at all one minute she is all nice and then she does things sometimes that are so infuriating chloe spoke up i know what you mean she reminds me of someone though christine commented she does but i cantput my finger on it chloe replied after a few moments let forget about that and concentrate on our shopping trip hermione suggested i agree and let just have some fun christine added and turned to chloe who nodded in agreement a n thanks for posting the chapter thanks for all the lovely reviews disclaimer i dontown anything chapter 21 harry was heading towards the mansion to meet up with lisa for their individual date as his mind wondered back towards his breakfast with hermione he enjoyed the time he spent with hermione immensely especially when they were away from the cameras and could be completely carefree without any worries it felt like old times again harry was brought back out of his reverie as the driver said mr potter we re here thanks harry answered with a smile and stepped out of the limo and knocked on the door the door opened and was greeted by a smiling chloe hi harry chloe replied with a smile how are you doing harry asked i doing great chloe answered with a smile so is lisa ready harry asked she ll be down in just a few minutes chloe answered thanks chloe do you have any plans for today harry inquired nothing much since we donthave any plans with you chloe answered i sure that you must have plans since you seem to be all dressed up harry commented i dontknow if i should take that as a compliment or not because i dontthink that i all dressed up now chloe replied teasingly of course i dontmean it like that you look good i mean you always look good harry mumbled i dontknow you all that well but from what i know i sure that you meant it as a compliment chloe answered with a laugh i glad that you seem to understand harry replied with a grin well some of us are going to do some shopping chloe answered sounds fun who else are going with harry replied with a grimace a typical guy response and all of us basically chloe answered what are you guys chatting about lisa asked as she came down the stairs nothing important are you ready to go harry asked with a smile sure am i dressed right lisa asked gesturing towards her khaki shorts and long sleeved shirt you look great harry added with a smile thanks so what exactly are we doing lisa asked you will see soon enough you chariot awaits you harry told her lisa laughed as she headed out the door harry gave chloe a quick smile before following lisa out the door so far all i know is that we are doing something outdoors any more hints lisa asked you will find out in a couple of minutes harry responded i actually a little nervous about what the date is about lisa added you dontneed to be nervous at all you ll have no problems during this date at all harry told her now you ve definitely got my curiosity lisa commented lifting her eyebrows we re here now harry told her as he looked out the window where exactly is here lisa inquired as she got out of the limo take a look outside harry answered lisa looked outside and saw an open path with grass and trees and said okay i know that we are in the woods and there are paths and trees all around that means that we are probably either hiking or cycling right you re right we re going biking you do know how to do that right harry asked well i do know how to ride a bike lisa replied with a laugh i assumed that harry responded amused though i haventridden in one for quite some time lisa responded i sure that you will pick it up right away harry replied let go and get our bikes lisa added walking forward i ll show you the way harry answered and they walked towards a small bike area where a couple of bikes awaited them lisa quickly got onto one of the bikes and said are you ready to go then let head off harry said and started to lead the way lisa followed admiring the green grass and the flowers are you going to keep up harry asked far ahead i was just admiring the scenery lisa commented want to race harry asked raising his eyebrows i never give up on a challenge lisa responded with a grin then let go harry answered starting off wait a minute you dontget to have a head start that cheating lisa exclaimed pedalling after him harry slowed down and waited for lisa to appear next to him i thought that you knew how to ride a bike harry teased her you were the one that was cheating lisa retorted on the count of three we go and head towards that tree over there harry instructed one two three they said together and they were off harry had the early lead but then pretty soon lisa caught up and was riding right next to him harry turned and gave her one of his killer grins and with that zoomed off ahead of her as if he suddenly had an extra gear lisa stood there shocked for a few seconds before regaining her composure and sped off after him but was unable to catch up with him and when she reached the tree she was slightly out of breath looks like i win harry replied with a grin yes you won but i dontthink it was completely fair and square lisa retorted why harry inquired because you were obviously trying to catch me off guard when you turned to me during the race lisa commented i was just trying to see how you were doing you were catching up and i was quite impressed harry answered you were lisa asked i was in fact in order to win i had to go faster than i normally ride harry added thanks i think lisa answered slowly it really was a compliment and yes i did mean to distract you harry whispered to you i cantbelieve you lisa exclaimed i couldnthelp it and you wouldnthave won me even if i hadn t harry added lisa was about to open her mouth to retort but then realized that he was right and responded in a grudging tone that may be true but you could have won more fair and squarely but what would be fun in that harry asked lisa just glared at him now why dontyou just look around and calm down harry suggested lisa sighed and took a look around and smiled in front of her was a small water fountain in front of the beach it looks beautiful out here lisa commented staring out at the ocean it is isntit harry replied standing next to her the sky is incredibly beautiful and the sea is calm and soothing lisa commented it a great place just to relax isntit harry asked i feel much calmer already lisa told him why dontwe sit down harry asked lisa nodded and they both sat down on the beach next to each other facing the ocean so harry what are you thinking right now lisa inquired staring at him i glad that i here with you harry answered sweet talk lisa responded with a blush no it true i feel comfortable sitting here with you and i want to know more about you harry answered what do you want to know lisa asked what your family like harry asked well i have one older brother and one younger brother my older brother and i get along great but he usually away from home most of the time but we talk on the phone all the time i dontget along that great with my younger brother but we re okay my parents are divorced when i was about 15 my dad recently got remarried and i get along with his new wife my mom is doing okay she hasntfound anybody yet but she seems to want to lisa answered it must have been hard for you for your parents to separate when you were 15 harry commented it was but i had some good support system and great friends that got me through it how about you lisa asked i had a rough childhood but like you i have amazingly good friends looking out for me so they went by alright harry added what else would you like to know lisa asked with a smile well if i can ask what happened to your previous relationships harry inquired well you can and basically there isntmuch to tell i just got out of a long distance relationship and it was great and everything but over time we just got too busy and didntspend enough time with each other we changed and we werentthe same people we were when we first met and we just grew apart lisa answered with a slight smile i can see how that could happen i glad that it was as simple as that harry answered i was sad when it was over but we both didntwant to waste any more time on a relationship that wasntgoing to work lisa added there one other question i want to ask you what do you think about the remaining women that you live with harry asked well this was a question that i was thinking could come up so i have thought about it a bit they have both bad and good qualities a lot of how i feel about these girls is based on gut and the tiny amount of interaction that we have christine i like her and she seems really sweet and means it but i dontknow if she really is ready for a serious relationship chloe is nice too but i get the feeling that there is more to her than that and that she is someone to look out for as for allie i dontknow what to say about her there are times where she freaks me out a little bit some of her comments can be quite strange and invasive and i just get this strange feeling about her now i think that hermione is great she seems to be really smart and friendly and i think would be a great friend but she a bit more private about her life than the rest of us and she doesntseem as into the group activities as we are which is a little bit sad lisa replied thanks for giving me your thoughts harry answered standing up harry lisa asked yes harry answered do you think we could ride a bit more lisa asked of course harry responded with a grin i want a rematch so we start the race here lisa instructed fine then but i warn you that i quite fast harry answered we ll see about that lisa replied with a sly grin and pulled down harry hat over his eyes and took off what in the harry said surprised and quickly lifting the hat off his head and saw that she was in the lead and took off riding really quickly harry just smiled while shaking his head and rode quickly after her and met her at the other side of the park i would have expected you to have been here sooner lisa answered looking at an imaginary watch i would have been if someone hadntpulled something over my head harry replied i dontknow why anybody would do that to you unless you were asking for it lisa answered with a sly grin how exactly was i asking for it harry asked not that it was me or anything but your hat and attitude was just yelling pull me lisa explained do you know what your actions are screaming at me to do right now harry asked no but i sure they arenttelling you anything lisa replied they re telling me to chase you harry added only if you can catch me lisa added quickly getting back on the bike and pedalling off you wontget away that easily harry answered as he pedalled quickly and tried to reach for her bike but she swerved and got away and pedalled away laughing softly and they spent the rest of the afternoon riding their bikes while chasing one another harry and lisa walked back to the mansion together smiling i had a great time thanks for taking me there lisa told her with a smile i had a great time as well harry replied it was quite nice to go outside and away from everything lisa added why donti walk you inside harry inquired lisa nodded and blushed slightly when they reached the door harry turned towards her and leaned in to kiss her but then the door suddenly opened and allie appeared in front of them oh i so sorry i had no idea that you were there allie said apologetically that alright i was heading in anyways lisa answered giving harry a quick peck on the cheek before heading inside so how are you doing harry allie asked harry stiffened slightly and replied i good and how are you doing i pretty good i ve got to go harry told her with a smile and headed out the door is there something wrong allie asked there nothing wrong at all i just had a really long day harry answered oh then you should definitely go back and rest allie replied i ll see you later harry told her with a slight smile see you allie told him with a forced smile and glared at lisa fading figure are you okay chloe asked looking at her i fine allie replied in thought and headed upstairs chloe shrugged and headed towards the kitchen and saw lisa hey girl how did it go chloe inquired it went great until someone opened the door lisa replied that explains some things but she looked quite upset do you know if anything happened to allie chloe said thoughtfully did something happen lisa asked i was hoping that you could tell me chloe replied i have no idea lisa answered so where did you guys go chloe asked raising her eyebrows we actually went out into the trailers and rode bikes lisa replied with a smile hey how did it go hermione asked with a smile it went really good better than i thought lisa said i glad for you did anything interesting happen hermione asked we dontactually know but allie was acting a little bit strange so we re guessing that something happened chloe piped in that is quite interesting hermione commented with a smile i think it is anyways do you guys want to head out to grab something to eat chloe suggested that ll be great i completely famished lisa added hermione are you in chloe asked sure i ll be there i ll go tell christine and allie hermione answered will you do that chloe commented sure i heading upstairs to put down some things hermione replied with a smile hermione smiled to herself as she thought about allie being flustered it made her feel quite happy as she headed upstairs to place her bags in her room and then headed towards christine room and knocked on the door christine are you there hermione asked i here what up christine said opening the door we re going to head out to grab a bite to eat and wanted to know if you wanted to join us hermione said sure just give me a second to grab a sweater christine answered with a smile i ll be back i ve got to visit allie hermione told her see you downstairs christine added hermione nodded and headed towards allie room and was about to knock on the door and heard some sounds coming from inside and cast a quick sound magnification charm at the door to try and catch what was going on in side the room you cantdo that she your an unfamiliar low voice said donteven finish that sense she isn t allie shot back but the other voice continued i ve got to go allie said and the door opened hermione what are you doing here allie asked i was just going to knock on your door and ask if you wanted to join us for dinner we were just heading out for a bite hermione asked that ll be fun allie replied i ll see you downstairs then hermione said with a wave hermione pondered what she heard coming for allie room and all these questions swarmed her who was the other voice that she heard from allie room and which girl was she talking about and the most important question of all was what was her plan exactly hermione thought to herself just then she was interrupted when her phone rang and she picked it up jane a familiar voice asked yes who is this hermione inquired it joan from nyu and i really just need to talk to you joan answered do you remember something hermione asked anxiously maybe but it all fuzzy and i really need to talk to you joan added hermione allie called out hermione turned and said i here we re waiting for you outside and do you think you could get lisa something to drink allie called out to her jane joan said i ll be right out hermione called out to allie allie nodded and headed out the door i sorry joan i was talking to someone so when do you want to meet hermione said apologetically i ve got a quick meeting and then i ll be free 8pm at my place joan answered i ll be there i might be a bit late but i ll be there hermione told her with anxiously see you then joan added before hanging up hermione closed her phone and looked at the time it was 6 30pm already so she would need to eat in a hurry and quickly grabbed the remaining glass from the dishwasher and rinsed it and filled it up with some juice i sorry guys i had a quick call i had to take shall we get going hermione said with a apologetic smile and handed her the cup thank you so much lisa told her gratefully and took a long sip before putting it down on the side table it wasnta lot of trouble hermione answered with a quick smile let go lisa replied and opened the door they all headed outside and decided to try this new italian place that was about a half hour away from the mansion they enjoyed a scrumptious meal of pasta and bread and they filled the night easily by chatting just then lisa stood up and held onto the table as if she was dizzy are you okay hermione asked concerned i fine i must have just gotten up too quickly i need to head back i forgot that there was still something that i need to do lisa answered are you sure chloe inquired dontworry i ll see you guys later back at the house lisa added bye chloe christine hermione and allie chimed in together lisa gave a quick wave and headed out the door hermione finished up the last of plate and grabbed a drink from her glass before taking a quick look at her watch and stood up are you going anywhere chloe asked actually i have a few errands to run and then i ll head back see you guys later hermione replied getting up and leaving okay we ll see you back at the house allie said with a wave hermione headed outside and quickly took a look around and headed towards a empty hallway and apparated at a location close to joan house where she knew there were very few people and quickly checked around to see if there were any people nearby when she saw that they coast was clear she walked out towards the house when she got this uneasy feeling that she could not shake off i hope that she okay hermione said to herself and quickly approached the door and knocked joan opened the door a few minutes later and said hi jane hello joan hermione said softly entering the place thanks for coming i didntknow who else i could talk to joan explained what happened hermione asked i really dontknow i starting to get these weird memories or flashbacks of talking to someone that i dontremember and then getting knocked out and these flashes of light joan added do you recall what you were talking about hermione asked i remember hearing the words nyu and paper and someone asking me about what i know and then i blacked out joan recalled when did you start getting these flashbacks hermione asked just about a couple days ago after meeting with an old mentor joan answered after some thought did your old mentor seem different at all to you hermione asked well i haventseen her in quite some time but there was something that i thought i was off about her she was quite persistent about my nyu articles joan replied do you think that maybe that wasntexactly your mentor hermione asked gently no i dontthink so she looks like her and sounds like her it doesntseem very likely joan said it is possible with the level of technology today hermione answered and began looking around are you okay joan asked i just getting this feeling that you are being watched hermione answered i dontthink so do you want something to drink joan asked nervously tea would be nice hermione answered and continued to look around and when she finally sensed something and rushed over to joan what going on joan asked just duck and cover hermione whispered to her and waited for a figure to appear in front of them what are they joan asked shocked i ll explain later just stay down hermione ordered joan just nodded and hid hermione took out her wand and approached then slowly who are you hermione asked firmly that depends on who you are the man answered let go of me joan shouted joan hermione cried out let me go joan cried out what do you want from her hermione asked firmly none of your business a woman answered stubefy hermione shouted and hit the women in the leg and she lost her grip on joan joan was so shocked that she just fell to her knees are you okay hermione said rushing over and helping her up and then she felt something hit her and sank to the ground and the last thing she saw was a dark cloaked figure by the time she got up she felt her body ache and she looked around and saw that she was in a room that she didntrecognize and that it was empty what going on hermione asked herself and got up gingerly and walked around and found nothing and apparated back to the clearing near the mansion and opened the door hermione walked into the house to everyone pacing about and asked what going on have you seen lisa christine asked concerned not since last night what happening hermione asked we cantfind her anywhere we just a note from her saying she had to go home chloe added can i see the note hermione asked girls i sorry to leave so abruptly but something came up that needs my immediate attention back home so i need to go back i hope to be back soon it nice knowing you guys tell harry that i sorry lisa at first we thought she really went home but the producers never heard anything and we called her family just to double check and they dontanything so we re a little bit worried christine replied i sure that nothing the matter hermione said in an effort to comfort them i really hope so allie said with conviction hermione had a sinking feeling that something was really wrong and hoped that she was wrong for the sake of her friend and sat down to process everything that has happened and drifted off the sleep a n thanks for all the reviews i hope that you enjoy the next chapter please review disclaimer i dontown anything chapter 22 hermione woke up in the morning and sensed that the mood in the house would not be as cheery as before and walked downstairs to get something to drink good morning hermione you re up earlier than usual christine said thoughtfully i couldntreally sleep have you heard anything hermione asked nothing but in a way i think that is quite good news christine replied that true she at least not at any hospital that we know of hermione added exactly i wish though there was a way that we would know for sure you know but there is nothing that we can do about it christine commented yeah i guess all we can do is wait to hear from her i wish they would tell us more about it though hermione replied morning chloe said to them with a yawn i see you didntget a good night sleep either christine complimented i canthelp but be a little worried about lisa i know that she can take care of herself but she did say she wasntfeeling that well the last time we saw her chloe commented you know what i just going and talk to the producer and see if they heard anything hermione commented standing up do you want us to go with you chloe asked that okay she might actually call back so it ll be good if you guys stay here hermione replied getting up okay then come back as soon as you here anything christine added dontworry you guys i sure that she is fine hermione told them as she headed out the door the first place that she headed to find harry house and knocked on the door hermione harry asked as he opened the door i came to see how you were doing hermione replied giving him a quick hug i doing alright but i am a little worried about lisa she seemed fine earlier and she didntmention anything about any family emergency harry answered to be completely truthful i am a little worried as well hermione admitted why harry inquired well she wasntfeeling that well after we all went out to dinner and headed off home before we all left and well i got a call from joan you know the nyu reporter so i went over there to see her and she seemed quite scared and worried and then out of the blue a few people just appeared maybe wizards or something that were looking for her so then of course i tried to protect her and it worked for a while and then i was just knocked out i didnthear anything though but i did see a faint glow and then i was out of it and when i came to i was in this empty house i didntsee anybody and my head hurt hermione explained are you alright harry asked concerned looking her up and down i fine hermione answered maybe we should get you checked out who know what happened to you harry replied moving her over to the sofa harry i fine really i feel fine and nothing out of place hermione assured her no you really should get checked out i ll take you right now harry said grabbing his jacket harry i really feel fine i promise that i will get checked out but first i want to check up on lisa hermione answered you promise harry asked i promise i give you my word hermione told him with a smile i do trust your word but if you re going to check on lisa then i want be there with you harry told her firmly harry i really appreciate your concern but i can take care of myself hermione protested i know that you can but i worried about you you can go but only if i take you harry answered with a firm tone hermione took a look in his eye and knew that he wouldntbudge and sighed okay you can come with me but only because i want your company hermione said relenting a bit good where are we going harry said with a smile well first of all i just want to talk to one of the producers to see if they have heard anything hermione explained okay let go harry said getting up hermione got up and paused slightly feeling a slight bout of dizziness are you okay harry asked rushing to her side i fine i just didnthave enough sleep hermione replied are you sure harry asked yep let go hermione replied walking towards the door okay harry replied looking back at her and then followed they walked towards the production office and headed inside mr potter what do i owe the pleasure ken asked as he saw them walking in it good to see too but i wanted to talk to you about lisa harry asked we want to ask you if you heard anything from lisa hermione added well we haventheard anything as of yet from lisa herself we also talked to some of her friends and family and from what i told they arentreally worried they say that she is quite independent and can take care of herself and told us not to worry about her ken replied do they know what kind of emergency that she was talking about hermione asked actually they dontbut apparently she has a lot of friends and she likes to help others when she can so it not impossible for them not to know anything about it ken explained so you guys haventheard anything new harry asked i haventbut i wouldntworry her parents arentworried so i wouldntbe too concerned oh and harry we will be meeting tonight as usual but there wontbe an elimination this time ken told him thanks harry told him that wasnttoo helpful hermione told him i know but what can we do harry asked well we could also do a bit of checking on our own hermione suggested how do you suggest we do that harry asked well i was just thinking that since this show is taped and that there are security cameras around we could just maybe check them out hermione replied i think that is something that can be arranged harry added with a grin let go check it out hermione replied harry grinned and turned towards the security office and within a few minutes he came out with a box of tapes that was quick hermione said with a grin what can i say i can be charming when i need to be harry responded you can be sometimes hermione replied with a laugh dontlook so surprised harry added with a mock anger i not surprised completely hermione replied do you want to watch these tapes or not harry inquired of course i do but out of curiosity what did you say hermione asked what are you talking about harry replied to the security personnel hermione suggested i didntsay anything out of the ordinary i just asked for the tapes and i got it harry answered that it hermione asked with disbelief that it harry insisted okay if you dontwant to say i wontforce you but only because i more worried about lisa hermione replied then we better get moving harry said hurrying along hermione shook her head and giggled as she chased after him once they were in the clear they apparated to the outside of his house they checked to see that they were in the clear and walked up to the door and quickly went inside okay then let get started harry said looking at the box of tapes there are too many tapes i had no idea there would be so many hermione commented going through the tapes there must be a way to get through these faster harry said popping the first tape in it ll take too long to go through each of these one at a time i ve got an idea but i need to go grab my labtop hermione told him it you have any ideas that would be great harry said fast forwarding and staring at the tv i ll be back soon hermione told him and apparated back to her room at the mansion hermione quickly went and grabbed her labtop and was about to apparate back out until she heard someone talking outside she peered outside and saw allie talking on her cell is everything taken care of allie asked allie paced about for a few moments and then nodded her head and said good everything would work out as long as everyone minds their own business talk to you soon hermione turned back around and apparated back to harry and placed down her labtop are you okay harry asked yeah i am let just get started i have this program on my computer that i have used that is also magically enchanced and is running on a trial basis and should speed up our searching process by a lot hermione explained well it that works it would make things so much easier harry commented okay i just need to connect the tv to my computer and load some information into the computer hermione continued so what do you want me to do harry asked can you put the first tape into the vcr hermione asked sure harry said and did as commanded okay let see if this will work and turned on the program and pressed play and then place her heads above the computer and murmured a few words what are you doing harry asked curiously i just telling the program what to search for hermione explained a few moments later the program started to show a screen of lisa entering the house that program seems to work really well harry replied impressed well it looks like she went inside around 8 05pm hermione answered looking at the time okay that good to know so is there any way to tell if she went into her room harry asked well from what i read they have cameras in the hallways but not any of the rooms to give us our privacy so we can check the other tapes for that footage hermione suggested harry went through the box and found one labelled hallway and placed it into the vcr and hermione loaded it into the computer and typed few commands into the computer did you see anything yet harry asked it will take a few minutes hermione replied watching the screen and her thoughts turned back to the conversation that she heard what are you thinking about harry asked softly i just heard an interesting conversation that allie had on her phone hermione explained what exactly did you hear harry asked she was asking is everything has been taken care of and that everything is going well as long as everyone minds their own business it just strange to hear and convinces me that she is up to something what i still dontknow hermione explained do you think that she has something to do with lisa disappearance harry asked i wouldntknow how i would link anything to her but wait a second you know while i was talking with joan on the phone allie called out to me hermione added do you think she knew about the meeting harry asked i cantsay for sure but it is possible hermione replied well that phone call was a little bit suspicious but you re right about how it doesnttell us anything about lisa harry answered thoughtfully just then the computer beeped and they turned their attention back to the computer and saw lisa entering her room about a few minutes later according to the time on the surveillance camera okay now let see when she left her room hermione commented so honestly do you think that allie is involved harry asked let just say that i have a gut feeling that she is involved hermione replied the odds are definitely against her harry replied thoughtfully i guess that we just have to wait hermione said turning her head back to the screen the computer beeped again and once again they turned their attention back to the screen and just when they thought the saw something the screen turned black and when the screen came back on the hallway was empty until a couple of minutes later lisa left the room why did the screen go black hermione asked curiously out loud maybe something was wrong with the camera harry suggested maybe but i have to get back i ll leave my computer here for you since i cantcome in carrying it since i didntleave with it hermione replied with a shrug as she looked at her watch then you better had back but remember what you promised me harry reminded her dontworry i ll remember hermione answered giving him a hug harry kissed her gently on the forehead and said remember to call me if you find out anything or if you need me hermione blushed and smiled and gave his should a quick squeeze before heading out the door harry watched her leave with a smile on her face and turned his head back to the computer muttering i hope i know how to use this just then the phone rang and harry looked and saw that it is hermione and said just the person i hoped to hear from did you miss me already hermione asked with a laugh always harry replied with a grin there is a document for using the program is on my computer hermione told him ah you are a mind reader now harry teased her what can i say i a woman of many talents hermione replied with a giggle now that is the truth harry added ciao hermione said see you in a bit harry added and hung up she really is something special harry said grinning as he opened the program hermione was smiling as she opened the door back to the mansion and walked into the kitchen you look like you re in a good mood good news christine asked i guess in a way it is i was talking to the producer and he told me not to worry about lisa because her family and friends arentworried and things like this have happened before hermione explained that good to know but do you think that you mind if we give her a quick call christine suggested i sure that it wouldnthurt hermione answered with a nod i was just wondering what number for lisa do you have christine asked what do you mean hermione asked i just wanted to know if maybe she gave you a cell number or something christine explained let me go and check hermione said heading upstairs to her room and looked through the sheets that were give to her and found a number that was written down next to lisa and headed back downstairs this is the number that i have for lisa hermione replied handing it over to christine thanks i haventtried this number yet christine said as he walked on over to use the phone guys allie said rushing into the room what is it allie chloe asked i ve got lisa on the phone allie told them really did you call her christine asked actually i did allie answered lisa chloe asked taking the phone put it on speaker hermione suggested just wait a moment while we put you on speaker chloe said and pressed the button lisa are you alright christine asked hey everyone i just wanted to let all of you know that i am fine and not to worry i sorry that i left in such a hurry but i had a urgent call from a friend of mine who wanted some help so i probably wontbe able to come back until after show is over but i wish all of you the best of luck lisa replied where are you hermione asked i staying with a friend lisa answered we ll miss you take care lisa christine piped in thanks but i ve got to go lisa replied in a rushed tone call us if you need any help hermione commented bye chloe added see you soon allie said after a moment and hung up the phone well it looks like you were right hermione christine replied with a smile i glad that she is feeling better chloe added yes now we can enjoy ourselves again allie added yes that is true hermione answered with a small smile is there anything wrong christine asked of course not i was just thinking what a coincidence that it was that just as we were going to call lisa that allie managed to get through to her what can i say except that great minds think alike allie replied with a smile i guess so hermione added i glad to be of help allie said i going to head upstairs now hermione told her wait a minute allie said what is it allie hermione asked i was just wondering if you were still worried about lisa allie asked i was but now that i heard her voice i not so worried hermione answered carefully i dontknow but i was just getting the distinct feeling that you still feel a bit uneasy about the whole situation allie pressed now why would i feel that way hermione asked i dontknow but i was wanted to make sure that you were okay allie replied i fine and my mind is definitely at ease hermione answered that is really good to know because you know what people say about curiosity killing the cat allie replied well you donthave to worry about me hermione replied i glad to hear that allie replied and gave a sweet smile there is definitely something fishy going on hermione muttered to herself and continued to head upstairs to her room and grabbed her cell phone and dialled a familiar number it me we just heard from lisa hermione told harry really when harry inquired just a few moments ago in fact it was right before we were going to give her number a try hermione explained is she okay harry asked she seems to be fine or at least that is what she told us hermione answered that good but harry prompted her i just get the gut feeling that there is more to this story hermione confessed and what made you come to this conclusion harry asked well it just too much of a coincidence that allie would call her just before we were going to and she said something to me hermione continued what did she say to you harry asked it wasntlike she came out and said that she had something to do with it but i think that she in her own way was telling me to back off hermione explained what exactly did she say harry asked she was talking about how curiosity killed the cat hermione answered now that does sound like a subtle warning harry said thoughtfully but hermione interjected well since she warned you then maybe it isntall of her fault harry added i guess that could be a possibility hermione commented after a moment so what do you have in mind harry asked i thought that maybe we could take a look at the tape again and maybe check on a few things hermione suggested well i ve been re watching that footage a few times and i dontsee anything new harry answered does it still turn black hermione asked it still does and i still dontknow why but i talked to someone in the production team and they said that it does happen sometimes if there was a glitch with the equipment harry explained okay then we must move on to the next logical step hermione started and what exactly is that harry asked i thought we could a bit of investigating are you going to help me hermione asked if you need help i ll be there harry added that good then meet me outside in half an hour hermione instructed i ll see you then harry replied thanks harry hermione replied no problem you know that i ll always be here for you harry responded with a smile i know see you later hermione replied and hung up the call and smiled and headed back downstairs hey girls hermione called out the chloe and christine hey hermione chloe called out what do you have there hermione asked looking at the piece of paper i dontknow yet but it must be from harry christine explained oh then we better go and get allie hermione replied i think she up in her room christine answered nope i downstairs allie said entering the room we were just looking for you hermione called you okay then what up allie asked we just got a letter from the producer and we wanted to make sure that we read it all together chloe answered well then what are you waiting for allie exclaimed okay

to it allie added this is definitely something to look forward to do you guys have any ideas christine asked i probably guessing that maybe a group activity or something like that since we arenteliminating anybody allie answered that makes a lot of sense christine said thoughtfully i going to head out for a bit hermione told them where are you heading chloe asked there are a few things that a friend of me asked me to get for her hermione answered quickly if you re heading towards the mall can you wait for me and we can go together allie suggested actually i not heading towards that direction hermione replied oh well then i ll see you later allie replied i ll be back soon hermione said with a wave see you soon christine called out hermione headed over to harry and knocked on the door hey i ready harry replied as he opened the door that good so we dontwaste any more time hermione commented so where are we headed harry asked i need to pick up some information on allie hermione explained where are we going to do that harry asked remember how i told you about visiting her old high school hermione added yes and i guessing that you would like to take a look at her file harry finished exactly i knew that you were smart hermione answered with a smile i dontknow if i should be insulted or not harry added i sure that you ll be able to figure it out hermione replied with a eye wink then i ll take it as a compliment harry replied whatever you want to believe hermione told him with a smile well let get going harry replied now that what we re talking about hermione said so why dontyou lead the way harry suggested just come with me hermione told him taking his had and they both apparated to the rutheford high school okay so i ll distract the secretary while you sneak in hermione instructed alright but what am i looking for harry inquired well the principal keeps the files in a locked cabinet from my memory he kept her file in the second top drawer hermione answered so all i need to do is get the file harry asked yep hermione confirmed so are you ready harry asked as if you need to ask hermione told him with a smile okay then lead the way harry replied gesturing toward the door hermione walked on up to the secretary office and said hello carolyn jane is that you carolyn asked yes it is is principal pierce in hermione asked actually he is on break now carolyn replied hermione gestured for harry get going and said so how are you doing i doing great i just spent the weekend with my nephew and niece so things are going pretty well carolyn replied hermione smiled and watched harry appartate into the principals office how old are they hermione inquired well my nephew name is sean is 7 year carolyn continued harry was inside the principals office and was going through the file cabinets to determine which ones help the information that we wanted why does he have so many files harry muttered to himself as he looked through the files if you would like you could wait for principal pierce in his office if you like carolyn asked could i really hermione asked sweetly of course he ll be back from his meeting in about 10 minutes carolyn replied thank you and tell him that i only need a few minutes of his time hermione told it was nice seeing you jane carolyn replied it was nice to talk to you too hermione said heading quickly into the office hermione quietly entered the room and was amused to see harry trying to open the door what are you doing hermione asked curiously i trying to get this drawer open since its locked harry explained have you forgotten that you have other ways of getting the drawer open hermione asked oh right harry said sheepishly as he took out his wand and the drawer opened now wasntthat so much easier hermione commented i would have thought of that eventually and i wasntsure if i was supposed to use magic harry protested we d better hurry hermione said looking into the drawer and pulled out the file harry looked over her shoulder and commented that looks like a pretty big file now all i have to do is make a copy of this file and place this back so that he wontrealize that it is missing hermione explained well then you better hurry harry said looking at the time it ll only take a moment hermione responded okay i ll stand watch near the door harry told her hermione nodded and picked up her wand and placed it over the file and slowly a file appeared next to it and slowly filled up with papers someone is coming in harry told her with a quick flick of her wand the file returned back to its original place and she quick sat down hello jane principal pierce hello it nice to see you too hermione added now who is this principal pierce asked pointing towards harry oh i forgot my manners this is one of my best friends harry hermione introduced nice to meet you harry principal replied it nice to meet you too harry said shaking his hand so what can i do for you principal pierce asked i just wanted a few moments of you time and ask you a couple of questions hermione said placing down the file ask away principal pierce replied i just wanted to ask you if you have seen allie or talk to her since the last time we talked hermione inquired i haven t principal pierce answered how about any other old students hermione inquired nope but is there anything wrong principal inquired everything is fine i just wanted to ask a few follow up questions hermione explained oh do you have any more questions principal pierce asked nope and thank you so much for your time hermione told him any time principal pierce asked we ve got to get going hermione replied if you have any other questions please feel free to give me call principal pierce answered thank you if i do need you i will hermione answered with a quick wave and headed out the door they headed out the door and headed back towards harry house and walked inside i cantwait to take a look at what they discovered on her hermione told him sure jane harry replied it not like i could actually use my real name hermione said rolling her eyes i think that jane totally suits you harry added hermione gave him a look proceeded to open the documents there were transcripts of her grades during the couple of years she was at the school and noticed that she got straight a s then came a list of teacher reviews which were all raves then came a list of her extracurricular activities which included many groups that helped others she flipped through a few more reviews and interviews that she had at the school before she came to her old transcript from her previous school did you find anything interesting harry asked i just looking at an old transcript of hers from her old school hermione replied and what does it say harry asked encouraged it doesntsay anything except that she is a tremendously talented student and that they dontbelieve in giving grades hermione explained i dontknow of any schools that do that harry commented and then there is this fax that principal sent the school just says that the fax number did not work and they never got a response hermione replied maybe the fax machine didntwork harry answered with a shrug but they tried faxing it at least 20 times hermione added now that is extremely interesting did you find anything else harry asked just this blank paper hermione said looking closely at the paper are you sure there isntanything on it harry asked i guess i can try to see if anything is hidden hermione replied using magic harry asked yes brainiac hermione said taking her wand out from its hiding place revela hermione said and noticed nothing happened and tired again a couple of times whats wrong harry asked it not working hermione explained let me try it harry said moving forward give it your best shot hermione explained harry tried doing the same spell a few times and still nothing i see that it not just me hermione said with a laugh i see that we must be using the wrong spell harry added what spell do you suggest then hermione asked why dontyou watch and find out harry replied okay hermione said harry tried a few different spells and nothing happened until harry fell to the floor what happened hermione asked i actually think that the sheet of paper is somehow protected harry explained protected by magic hermione asked yes i got shocked by something harry responded well in that case then maybe if we both tried doing this together hermione suggested okay as long as it works harry said shrugging let try this together hermione reported harry nodded and followed her lead one two three hermione started and together they blasted their wands and the paper began to glow and words appeared faerway academy for the gifted known for training up and coming gifted magical

job done extremely determined to the point of scaring some of the other students has a bit of a tiny temper problem counsellor see attached report she has been to see the councillor harry asked i had no idea but let see what on it hermione replied turning the page over counsellor comments she seems to be a bit forlorn and distant kind of a loner and likes to work alone there have been a few complaints about some of her behaviour but i had a talk with her and the complaints seemed to have stopped she still seems to be angry at her parents for abandoning her but she doesntlike talking about them and displays some hostile attitude towards her family and has a bit of an anger management problem but we are making progress on the problem and it appears to be getting better so we know for sure that she is magical then and that she must have had a bad childhood and that we should definitely keep a look out for her harry complimented you know that the name of the school sounds so familiar to me i must have read something about the school hermione replied thoughtfully i dontdoubt that at all you read a lot harry replied rolling his eyes in fact i think i came across it when i was reading some books just because i wanted to brush up on my history hermione said and do you remember where you read it harry asked you know i loaded up some of the books onto my laptop so maybe i could do a quick search hermione added heading back to her computer and began typing in a few sentences harry sat down as he began to process the information that he received and the truth was he didntknow what to think about this new development harry i think i found it hermione said gesturing for harry to follow her it says in this book that faerway school was founded hundreds of years ago but nobody is sure when and is famous for training fairies hermione read fairies harry asked that what it says but i didntknow that they actually still existed hermione replied in surprised but i thought that most fairies were tiny harry commented i think that is just a stereotype hermione explained oh but does that mean that she a fairy harry asked well not necessarily the school has expanded and they just donttrain fairies anymore hermione replied scanning the page just then there was a knock on the door and from the peep hole he saw that it was the producer i should go hermione said looking at her watch you should go because we dontreally want to explain this harry said i ll see you tonight then hermione said and with a wink she was gone what took you so long ken asked sorry i was in the bathroom harry answered sheepishly so are you ready ken asked yes i am so what exactly is the surprise for tonight harry asked well you are going to go on a group date ken explained so is there a reason for your visit harry inquired yes i just wanted to ask you to see if you can read this during the ceremony and if you want you can say a few words about lisa ken added sure but why are we doing this harry asked confused because we want to pay a little tribute to lisa because we know that the audience would like that we know that everyone still here misses her ken replied is there something you arenttelling me harry asked dontworry about it it nothing just keep your energy up for the taping in an hour alright ken said sure harry said but he couldnthelp but get a feeling that something was going to happen tonight a n thanks for everyone review and i hope you enjoy this chapter disclaimer i dontown harry potter or abc chapter 23 hermione headed back into the mansion and headed back upstairs a few moments later there was a knock on her door and she opened it who there hermione asked opening the door do you have a moment christine asked of course come on in hermione replied i here for a couple of reasons christine explained okay hermione said sitting down on the bed first of all i was just wondering if you dontexactly like hanging with us christine asked no what would give you that idea hermione asked because you are off on your errands a lot christine explained no not at all i just had a lot of stuff that i had to do hermione added i dontmean to be really suspicious but it seems weird that you have so many errands to run that the rest of us dontreally seem to need to christine added hermione started to pace a little bit trying to answer that one but said but it wasntjust errands for me they were for some friends of mine and i head to go meet some of my friends and for my work because some people arentas competent as they should be i know how that can happen christine said with a laugh do you guys all feel that way hermione asked nervously a little bit but it was allie who actually brought it up christine explained what exactly did she say hermione asked well she was just saying that she thought that it was strange that you were always out of the house and that maybe you were hiding something from us christine answered what do you think hermione inquired honestly i dontknow some of the things she said were out of line but a few things she said seemed to make some sense but something tells me that i can trust you christine answered after a moment you do hermione said i do and everyone is entitled to their own secrets and the other reason why i wanted to see you was to ask you what you thought about the whole lisa situation christine added why are you asking me hermione added well because you were the only person to actually be able to talk to the producer and you seem good at reading people christine answered i guess that true well the truth is i think the things that happened were all really strange but i cantreally think of any reason why they would lie to us so i believe they said all they know however personally i feel like they should have been a bit more worried hermione answered so you think that something wrong christine asked i dontknow anything for sure but it just a feeling that i get how do you feel hermione answered i actually still a little bit worried but the phone call did help a lot christine commented yeah that phone call happened at the perfect time hermione added thoughtfully what are you thinking christine prompted nothing so what do you think will happen tonight hermione asked quickly to change the subject i have no idea but speaking of tonight i need to go and get ready christine added i do too hermione replied so i ll see you downstairs then christine said hermione nodded and closed the door after she left and shook her head as she realized that she definitely needed to be more careful from now on with all the girls harry couldntshake the feeling that something wasntright all through the ride to the mansion and slowly walked up to the door and decided to just have a good time tonight and knocked on the door hello harry matthew said answering the door hello matthew how are you doing today harry asked i doing alright i sorry to see that lisa left the show matthew replied yeah i am too did you hear anything else about what happened to her harry casually asked nothing officially of course but i heard the producer on the phone and after he hung up seemed a tiny bit upset matthew replied do you know what the phone call was about harry asked no idea but dontask ken about it because he seemed not to like people asking him about it matthew advised him thanks for the advice harry told him with a smile no problem i ve got to talk to a few people before the ceremony begins matthew told them see you in a bit harry told him looking around to see if hermione had come down yet harry felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to see allie standing there and he placed a smile on his face and asked hello allie how are you doing i doing well and how are you doing allie asked not too bad harry replied so how do you feel about the lisa leaving the show allie asked i sorry that she left before the elimination ceremony and that i didntget the chance to get to know her even better harry answered carefully i feel sad about that as well i thought she could be a good friend as well allie added harry said i sorry but i was told that i had to talk to the director about something before the ceremony you ve got to do what you have to allie answered i ll see you later then harry told her quickly and walked off he avoiding me allie murmured to herself and walked towards the makeup area harry stood quite a way away and took a deep breath and went over to talk to some of the camera crew how are you doing peter harry asked not bad but not too good are you all set for tonight peter asked as ready as i can be harry replied you should get back into the hall peter replied after listening to the mike thanks for the heads up harry replied walking towards the hall hermione was walking down the stairs to get ready for the ceremony when she was pulled off to the side and turned around she let go of the breath she was holding in when her eyes met with the familiar set of green eyes you scared me hermione scolded him i sorry but i wanted to talk to you before anyone else harry replied apologetically what wrong hermione asked concerned well nothing there nothing in particular that was wrong with me but i heard something harry answered what did you hear hermione asked softly nothing that is certain but ken was worried about something harry answered what do you think he was actually worried about hermione asked well i felt like he was hiding something from me earlier today when he was talking about lisa harry replied so you think that ken heard something that happened to lisa but didnttell us right hermione replied slowly yes and how they all wanted us to say a few words about lisa during the ceremony harry added that doesntsound very good but we need to find out what he knows then hermione commented do you have a plan harry asked not yet but i will hermione answered with a smile we d better get going harry commented yeah we do need to be a bit more careful hermione nodded did something happen harry asked it just lately i ve been out of the house a lot and the girls are starting to notice and they want to know what going on yes allie was the one to actually bring it up but christine mentioned that she did think about asking me about it and of course if i were them i would be suspicious as well hermione explained i know what going on and donteven go there harry scolded her lightly so what exactly am i thinking hermione asked raising her eyebrows you re starting to feel bad about lying to them and you want to tell them to truth but harry started but i shouldntfeel bad because it all a part of the show and that they ll understand all of it because it wasntlike i wanted to hurt them hermione finished for him rolling her eyes but smiling good if you didntknow that then i would start getting worried after all you are a know it all harry replied that miss know it all who has saved your butt at least a dozen times to you hermione replied back slapping him playfully in the arm i thought that a know it all could at least count harry teased her and i thought that you were a gentleman hermione replied back i always a gentleman harry responded gently taking her hand and kissed it with an exaggerated bow what was that hermione asked with a giggle i was being a gentleman harry answered you think that would convince me that you re a gentleman hermione asked in between bursts of laughter it isntpolite to laugh you know harry replied after he cleared his throat and placed his arm out and now what are you doing hermione asked holding back a giggle it it common knowledge that we allow ladies to go first and i am waiting to escort you inside harry answered raising his head in a serious manner that isntbeing polite that is just chivalry i thought that chivalry was dead but apparently it is being reborn in you hermione answered shaking her head i was being completely polite in considering you a lady i mean after your last burst of laughter i doubt anyone would consider you a lady suit yourself there are surely a lot of girls that would love to take your place harry answered back with a sly grin hermione glared at him and sputtered out you little ego out of words anger does not suit you harry teased her walking away hermione then followed quickly behind him and tapped him on the shoulder harry turned around surprised as she grabbed his glasses hermione what are you doing harry asked trying to find her form i right in front of you hermione said walking closer to him and pulled away as he reached for his glasses you re not playing fair hermione harry said with a little uncertainty i over here hermione said waving the glasses two can play this game harry replied after a moment and grinned and pretended to trip and fell to the ground hermione rushed to his side and asked with concern are you okay harry lowered his head and placed his arms around her waist and lifted her up hermione gasped in surprise and said what do you think that you are doing i helping you off your feet harry answered easily put me down this instant hermione exclaimed did you say higher harry teased her dontyou dare hermione said in a stern tone only if you apologize and give me back my glasses harry answered back why do i need to apologize hermione answered you really wontapologize harry asked again i shouldntbe the one apologizing hermione added okay then harry added and tickled her stop hermione replied in between giggles harry shook his head with a grin and continued to tickler her and hoisted her higher up put me down you know i dontlike heights hermione exclaimed nervously only if you apologize harry answered you are one little hermione started excuse me harry a voice called out yes harry asked and quickly put hermione down both of them a bit embarrassed both you and ms granger need to head into the hallway a camera man told them i ll be there in a minute harry answered and turned to see hermione heading off already so i take it that hermione may already have a place in your heart matthew asked what are you talking about harry inquired it just the way that the two of you look at each other it looks like there something there matthew explained i donthave any idea what you re talking about harry replied nervously you donthave to pretend with me there nothing wrong with falling for a friend matthew replied with a nudge i know that and that not the case between hermione and me harry asked would it help if i thought that there was something on her side as well matthew prodded harry head popped up and asked with interest really i see i got your attention matthew commented with raised eyebrows and a sly grin just answer the question harry asked yep i d say to give the relationship a chance matthew told him we are just friends harry said after a moment really well can i give you a bit of advice matthew asked sure harry replied i would tone it down if i were you matthew commented tone what down harry inquired the way you are with hermione just like before it may cause quite a bit of jealously matthew advised we were just goofing off harry answered others may see it as something else you could easily be mistaken as a couple matthew commented before heading off harry just smiled slightly and headed off to the hallway good evening ladies and gentlemen as all of you know a few things have changed since the last time you tuned in i am unhappy to say that lisa reeves due to a personal emergency had to return home and will not be returning to the show how do you all feel about that matthew asked all of us are saddened by this news because we all were getting along quite well christine answered we all feel sad that we are losing a friend chloe added lisa was a great girl and easy to get along with we will all definitely miss her although it is also true that we have one less person to compete with though allie said with a tiny laugh the other girls laughed a little as well that is true and honest too what about you harry matthew asked i saddened by the fact that i wontget a chance to get to know her even better and that i wontbe able to spend more time with her things were going really well between us but i glad that she was able to go back home and deal with her personal emergency i know that i would do the same harry replied i agree that shows that she has a good sense of what really important in life and makes me happy to know her hermione added i totally agree with you christine added with a smile now tonight rose ceremony will not take place and instead we will be having a group date harry why dontyou lead the way matthew announced harry nodded and said are you guys ready to go the girls nodded and followed harry out the door ladies first harry said opening the door thank you you are such a gentleman chloe replied with a smile christine and allie smiled as they also got into the limo harry whispered you see they think i a gentleman only because they want you like them hermione whispered back teasingly why am i getting the feeling that you just want to burst my ego harry replied pushing her into the car i just telling you the truth hermione whispered back with a grin harry shot her a dirty look and entered in the limo himself so where are we headed tonight christine asked actually this time i dontreally know they just told me that it would be a surprise harry answered well then we will just have to wait allie replied with a smile yep we do i quite anxious myself harry replied grinning so did they give you any more hints chloe asked not really harry added i think it really nice for all of us to hang out together hermione commented we haventdone much of a group date for some time it will definitely be fun christine added it looks like we re here harry said looking outside where exactly is here christine asked i think that it a karaoke bar hermione replied looking out the window really harry replied grimacing a bit is something wrong allie asked concerned nothing is wrong harry replied back pulling a light smile it looks like you are a bit tense hermione asked sweetly i fine really harry answered hermione laughed quietly what funny hermione chloe asked i just had a flashback with one of my best friends and singing it was a funny sight hermione replied you mean that they cantsing christine asked no that was not what made it funny he is not great singer but he wasnthorrible by all means he just got picked to sing a song that wasntright for his tone hermione explained you friend must have been horrified chloe added oh he was completely mortified still is hermione answered looking at harry i would be embarrassed as well allie replied after a moment harry how would you feel in that situation hermione asked sweetly well if i was that person i would only be a little embarrassed after all it wasntlike he was a horrible singer he just had to sing a bad song harry added i sure that harry has a great voice christine replied encouragingly thanks for your vote of confidence but i donthave a great voice harry answered gratefully i sure that you re just being modest but i donthave that great a voice either chloe confided i really doubt that harry added i donthave that many fond karaoke memories myself which is why i haventsang for quite some time chloe commented harry grinned back at her in response so who would like to sing first allie asked changing the subject i d say that hermione should go first harry answered that alright i not ready yet hermione commented dontbe nervous hermione i sure you ll do great christine added hermione you arentafraid are you harry asked of course not i will go first if you guys insist on it hermione replied giving him a dirty glare that great let us pick you a song allie added what kind of song would you like to sing chloe asked how about this one harry suggested with a grin that a good choice christine commented what song did you pick for me hermione asked nervously i sure you will be thrilled with the choice harry told her with a sly look in his eye so what is it hermione asked nervously on my own from les miserables harry answered really hermione asked is that song a problem for you chloe inquired of course not but i wouldntexpect anyone that i knew to pick that song for me hermione explained do you want us to pick you another christine asked no it will be fine hermione replied you can do it chloe added i know i can hermione replied directing the comment to harry then go on and sing harry replied holding back his laughter hermione smiled but was angry inside as she knew that harry had done that on purpose because he remembered her debacle at the karaoke party during a few years ago but what harry didntknow what that she had practiced and seriously improved as she did a lot of work to prevent that kind of situation from occurring again hermione got up to the mike and waited for the familiar words to appear on the screen on my own hermione began to sing softly but firm at first and became more confident as the song continues on harry was quite surprised at how good she sounded it was quite different to the time that he had last heard her sing she looked confident yet calm she sounded really good he should have known that she would have found a way to try and improve her technique in singing once she was finished everyone clapped harry the loudest especially and hermione enjoyed the surprised look on his face and quickly winked at him with a smile that was awesome hermione christine told her it was awesome you made it sound like you had a terrible voice chloe teased her hermione you were just being modest werentyou harry asked i haventsung in quite a long time and i wasntsure what exactly i sounded like hermione replied sheepishly well you sounded pretty confident if i didntknow anything i would think that you had taken some lessons harry added i haventtaken any lessons at all but i did get some tips from a friend which helped quite a bit hermione replied i agree that practice is quite important in order to sing well but if you have no talent then no matter how much you practice it still wontdo any good christine added that is something that i agree with there is this one girl that was in my high school who thought she was really talented entered our school talent competition being sure that she would win but ended up being teased about it for quite some time chloe added so was her year ruined allie asked oh no only a couple of weeks being that she was one of the most popular and influential people at our school which i find to be completely unfair chloe replied rolling her eyes dontyou hate that allie asked hate who christine asked people who others seem to like regardless of what they do allie explained i dontknow about that i mean yeah if they are mean but the girl that i was talking about is actually really nice so it hard to hate her chloe explained do you know someone like that hermione asked not exactly i mean i know her but we re not friends in fact she doesnteven know that i exist allie replied that sounds horrible do you want her to know you christine asked softly is she important to you chloe asked i want her to know who i am but she not important to me but she should know everything allie replied in an angry yet eerie tone allie what should she know harry asked i sorry but i dontwant to talk about it anymore allie replied smiling slightly it alright are you okay hermione asked i fine i think i ll go up next allie said standing up chloe and christine exchanged worried glances hermione was beginning to get weird vibes coming from allie it worried her because she was getting the feeling that the comment was directed at her are you okay harry whispered i fine hermione told her with a slight smile allie chose to sing the song he loves u not by dream her voice was similar to hermione but she sang with more confidence and conviction in her voice she danced with the music and made gestures in tune with the music chloe and christine clapped and said great job allie thanks you guys allie replied with a smile good job hermione told her what did you think allie asked turning towards harry i think you did a great job with the song harry told her not a song i would picture you singing chloe replied i wanted to go for something a little bit different allie answered taking a sip of a drink i ll go up next christine said standing up christine chose to sing celine dion song it all coming back to me now as she was a singer she saw the song beautifully hermione smiled and turned to look towards harry and saw that he was engrossed in watching her and once again she felt a tinge of jealousy way to go christine hermione told her once she was finished you did an amazing job although you do have an unfair advantage over us chloe teased her great job christine allie told her you sang beautifully harry told her with admiration in her voice thanks you guys and i definitely have more experience than you guys but its not a competition is it christine asked of course not hermione answered reassuringly just then a waiter entered the room and handed harry a piece of paper what is it harry hermione asked it looks like they have planned a game for us harry answered what kind of game chloe asked basically it kind of a quiz to see how well you guys know each other and what exactly i know about you harry replied that sounds interesting so what are the questions christine inquired it says here that you guys have already answered these questions in a questionnaire that you guys filled in about a week ago and they chose from those questions harry added okay i wondered why they wanted us to answer those questions chloe commented so what happening next allie asked well we get to see your answers and mine harry told them a waitress entered the room and said i here to get the answers from mr potter before revealing your answers that ll be interesting to know chloe added okay then why dontwe start with the first question the waitress whose nametag said alice so who do you think would be considered the most energetic alice asked out of all of the girls i would have to say chloe harry replied with a smile the girls seemed to think the same way alice replied that good right harry asked yep i would think so on to the next question which of these girls do you think to be the heartbreaker alice asked um that would be hard to judge from but i would say probably be chloe or allie i d guess i d have to go with chloe harry answered why would you say chloe alice asked well i not saying that she would mean to break hearts but from the way that she composes herself and she is beautiful that would very easily be the case harry answered and why would you eliminate allie alice asked because from what i know of her she doesntseem like that type of person from what she has told me harry answered okay that good let see how the results turned out now it looks interesting it seems like hermione and chloe are tied alice answered hermione harry asked surprised you look surprised is there a reason for it alice curiously asked hermione is not a heartbreaker i mean just look at her she beautiful and smart and funny and i just dontsee why anyone would think that about her harry explained and darted towards hermione hermione looked a little sad but otherwise fine and gave him a quick smile okay then on the second to last question then which girl remaining would you consider to be everybody best friend alice asked hermione harry answered quickly that was really quick i guess you already knew the answer to that one alice answered well we get along really well harry replied sheepishly that good and the girls popular pick would be hermione as well so girls what do you think about hermione alice added well for me personally i thought that we got along quite well and would definitely be able to be friends outside of the show and she easy to talk to christine answered that good now down to the final question which is really strange in a way if there was a crime to be committed and all of these girls were suspects who would be the last person that you suspect alice asked that ll have to be hermione harry answered and could you elaborate on why you chose hermione alice asked basically because hermione is a caring smart individual and she just wouldntcommit a crime harry answered so basically it just a feeling alice probed it just that the moment i met her i knew that i could trust her no reason why it just a feeling that i got harry explained we do depend on a feeling in our gut a lot according to these result the winner was christine but hermione was a close second alice replied that was kind of fun is there anything else alice harry asked actually there is one final thing that will be announced after the last person has sung alice replied leaving the room chloe you re up hermione told her encouragingly okay i going to pick i ll be by edwin mccain chloe replied flipping through the pages i like that song dontbutcher it allie teased her i ll try my best chloe replied back in mock anger christine just laughed chloe started off the song very softly at first and then quietly but then came back much stronger she was not the best singer but she could hold her own and harry admired her determination to finish the song even though she could not always find the right note good job chloe it was awesome hermione told her yep it was good for a amateur and you didntbutcher it up too badly allie answered thanks i think chloe told allie no it was a compliment allie added you did a good job chloe dontlisten to allie it was not at all butchered christine told allie thanks christine i think i ll take the compliment of a real professional chloe commented one that is too nice allie added in undertone did you say something christine asked nothing allie told her pouring herself some water so are you guys all ready for the final surprise alice asked sure the girls chimed in together okay then alice said handing them a envelope dear allie christine chloe and hermione i hope that you have all enjoyed the date and had some fun for tonight will be the final night for one of you there will be an elimination ceremony tonight after all thanks ken a rose ceremony chloe asked surprised and a little uneasy i had no idea myself wow they didnttell me either harry answered surprised just then alice came in and handed him the phone hello harry asked the rose ceremony will take place as soon as she guys get back to the house so be ready ken replied so soon harry asked yep so make your decision carefully but quickly ken told him okay harry answered it was a last minute decision so i wasntable to tell you earlier ken explained apologetically all of the girls left the karaoke place quickly in the car and all were quickly driven back to the mansion hermione gave him a quick reassuring squeeze as she left the limo harry smiled in response and waited in the limo at this point in the show they had agreed previously that hermione would be eliminated earlier on in the game but now he wasntso sure he was wrestling with his decision as he wasnta hundred percent confident in his feelings at this point it was happening must too quickly and he had wanted more time to think harry got out of the limo a few minutes later and took a deep breath and walked inside matthew greeted him as he entered and shook his hand are you ready matthew asked i guess so not that i have much choice do i harry asked i guess not but i sure you ll make the best choice matthew commented with a smile i as ready as i can be harry told him signalling to start and looking across the room and seeing that allie and chloe were in some sort of discussion ladies and gentleman welcome to a special rose ceremony where one of our lovely ladies will be eliminated tonight matthew said into the mike harry walked towards the table and grabbed a rose and took a deep breath hermione harry called out hermione gasped in surprise but caught herself and walked up will you take this rose harry asked i will hermione replied nodding and gave him hug harry said i still need you hermione smiled and kissed him lightly on the mouth surprising the both harry was surprised at first and smiled at her as she walked back to her place christine will you accept this rose harry asked yes i d love to christine answered with a smile and harry gave her a quick hug before pulling back harry was looking at allie and chloe and was about the call out the name of the person to receive the final rose chloe walked forward and said in a quivering voice i sorry but i cantdo this it all my fault what is it christine asked chloe burst into tears a n i sorry about the long wait you guys had for this chapter i would have had it up sooner but my computer crashed and i lost everything that i wrote so i had to start from the beginning again and then other things happened an my internet wouldntwork for awhile so now i finally have things sorted up i hope you enjoy this chapter i will try to update the next chapter a lot of sooner please review and let me know what you think disclaimer i dontown hp jk rowling does i dontown the bachelor abc does chapter 24 everybody looked at chloe with surprise and asked what wrong chloe i canttake it anymore it was my fault chloe blurted in between tears what are you talking about chloe christine asked confused you know the reason why lisa had to go home chloe replied yes so hermione asked well i was the one to convince her to go home chloe explained slowly you mean there was no real emergency christine inquired their was a reason for her to go home but i just made it into a bigger deal than it actually was chloe admitted but how did you convince her to go home allie asked it was a bit of luck i guess once we got back home from the dinner i went in to see how lisa was doing and she was telling me about how she was worried about one of her friends and she had to leave the room for the bit and the phone rang and she asked me to answer it and it happened to be her friend so i told lisa that i thought that it was best for her to go back home because it seemed like her friend really needed her chloe explained crying slightly and lisa didntquestion it hermione asked softly well she didnthave a reason no to trust me and like i said she had been worried about her friend for awhile so she really didntneed much convincing chloe replied why did you do it christine asked i dontknow it just that i really wanted to be able to make it through the next elimination and lisa was doing so well with getting picked and i just did it i dontknow why i just did it chloe added between tears chloe i really surprised that you did this so why hasntshe come back then allie asked i dontknow probably did stay to help her friend but that is all i did chloe answered sadly just then some people in uniforms came in and whispered something to matthew who looked quite shocked harry and hermione looked at each other in surprise silently asking each other what was going on chloe these policemen would like to talk to you for a moment matthew said what chloe asked looking extremely surprised did you have anything to do with disappearance of lisa reeves the policeman asked she missing i had no idea chloe answered she was officially reported missing yesterday you were the last person to have contact with her the policeman continued no that isntpossible the last time i saw her was at this house and maybe i talked to her on the phone when she had called before chloe replied really the policeman asked yes that is the truth why are you asking me this chloe asked surprised because this is a current investigation and we are trying to get to the truth to what really happened where were you the last couple of days he asked in a firm tone i was here with the other girls filming this show and i was in the house most of the time chloe replied so you haventleft the house by yourself say yesterday the policeman asked again no i haven t why do you keep asking me these questions chloe asked exasperated because we have evidence to say the contrary he replied what are you talking about chloe asked looking up in surprise is this yours he asked bringing out a plastic bag with a card in it that my business card but how did you get it chloe asked we found it left on the floor near an apartment where she was last seen i think you re going to have to come with us the policeman said gesturing to his partner to come forward i dontknow how my card got there but it wasntme chloe tried to explain again that what they all say the policeman replied and started talking to the producer what do you think of the whole situation harry asked hermione in a whisper i dontknow chloe all that well but i dontthink we re seeing the whole picture hermione answered i think that something is off with this as well do you think that she did it harry asked honestly i don t this whole is just strange hermione replied with a sigh i think so too i think this requires some investigating harry answered are you suggesting that we look into the situation hermione asked raising her eyebrows well i know that you want to so i thought that i d say it first harry whispered back please harry dontuse me as an excuse you never could sit still for very long hermione replied back harry smiled in response and walked up closer to see if he could take a look at the evidence and saw that hermione was walking forward as well what going on harry asked matthew i think that right now they want to hold off on the filming of the show for now matthew explained do you think they will go for that harry asked i not totally sure but from what i hear the producer wants to continue to show as if chloe was eliminated matthew replied he wants to stay away from the bad publicity right but we donteven know if chloe had anything to do with lisa disappearance at all harry added true but she did admit to causing another contestant to leave so in that way she is already eliminated and that all that matters matthew explained i see i guess that makes sense in a way do you think you could do me a favor harry asked i will if i can matthew answered do you think it would be possible for you to come up with a way for hermione and i to go off and do a bit of our own thing for a couple of hours without making allie or christine suspicious harry asked i sure that i can come up with something but do i even want to know what you re up to matthew inquired maybe it best that you dontknow then thanks a lot harry told him and turned towards hermione so what were you guys talking about hermione asked i was just asking him about what happening right now harry explained and hermione prompted well it seems as if no matter what happens that chloe has already been booted from the show because of how she handled the lisa situation and now they dontwant anything to do with her because they dontwant any of the bad pr harry answered so that means it would be possible for this to be a setup because if somebody knew about how this thing works then they could get particular people to leave the show and save themselves hermione added thoughtfully and that would put the main suspicious on christine or allie then right harry added well it is more highly likely to be one of the remaining contestants but there is still a slight possibility it could be someone who works behind the scenes as well hermione said well that possible but they dontseem to have a reason to do that though harry replied yes i ll admit that is not as likely and did you notice how allie and chloe seemed a bit chummy earlier hermione asked i did notice that they were talking alone a bit and were together most of the time harry answered after thinking a moment well while you were chatting with matthew i took the opportunity to talk to christine for a bit i wanted to chat with allie but she was talking with somebody else hermione piped up i always knew you were never one to sit down and wait for answers what did she say harry asked eagerly well from what i got from her is this vibe where she doesntseem to know anything and was upset to hear that someone she would call a friend would do something like this she was very shocked but she really hopes that chloe didntdo it she doesntseem to think that she could do something like that hermione replied well i doubt that christine had anything to do with it but you know as we have found out that things are not always want they seem harry commented i agree but my instincts tell me that this is more likely a work of allie hermione told him well then we have some investigating to do i already talked with matthew and he said that he ll come up with a reason why we re not around here i think that i ll have a quick chat with allie harry replied looking around are you sure that a good idea hermione asked nervously what you donttrust my investigation skills harry asked hurt showing in his eyes of course i trust you but allie seems to be tricky and we dontknow much about what types of magic she may be using just be careful hermione countered i promise that i ll be careful as long as you promise to keep out of trouble harry pointed out i always careful hermione retorted so where exactly are you going harry asked i just going to get a closer look at the evidence hermione answered okay then remember to call me once you find some answers harry told her i will remember be careful and be on guard hermione reminded him okay okay let get going now harry told her hermione watched harry walk towards allie with a heavy heart and then headed off herself to the police station hi allie how are you doing harry asked softly hi harry i not doing that great allie replied with a slight smile it has been a crazy time right now do you think that chloe did it harry asked carefully you want to know what i think allie asked of course i think it would be good for all of us to talk it out harry replied honestly i am quite surprised about the whole thing chloe did not seem like the type of person who would do something like this allie answered did you get the sense of anything when you were talking with her earlier harry asked not at all i mean she seemed a little quieter than usual but that was all she seemed to be fine the last time i saw her though allie added so you dontthink that she had anything to do with her disappearance harry asked i dontthink so but i dontknow her all that well so i cantbe a hundred percent sure allie replied looking at him so did you know anything about lisa disappearance harry asked no why would you even ask me something like that do you think i had something to do with it allie asked obviously upset i am not at all suggesting that is there something you would like to tell me harry countered i sorry but it just seemed like you were directly asking me about it and i just couldntbelieve that you would think so horribly of me allie broke off in tears i not saying that you had anything to do with it but i just feel like you re keeping something from me and that why i was asking harry answered smoothly that all allie asked quietly yes that the only reason i was asking you anything harry answered well then there is something that i have been keeping a secret allie replied with a sigh and what is it harry asked eagerly well the truth is that i know who are i ve heard about you since i was young and i know that you re a wizard allie replied slowly oh and is that it harry asked well there is this one other thing is that when i first signed up for the show i didntknow that you would be in it and i was quite surprised that you would even be on a show like this are you mad that i never told you allie added i cantbe really because since we re on camera most of the time it would be hard for you to tell me and it not like i actually told you myself so i cantreally be mad about that harry replied are you sure because i dontwant to be rude or anything but i feel like you ve been avoiding me and i just want this competition to be fair and that i have an equal chance of making it to the next round allie asked what would make you think that harry asked it just a feeling that i get from you and i really hoping that i wrong but if its true i would really just like to know allie replied well i not avoiding you or else i wouldntbe talking to you right now would i harry answered i guess so but it seems more like you re question me than trying to see how i am allie answered i sorry if i made you feel that way i really not at all trying to avoid you harry replied softly allie looked up at him slowly with a hopeful look in her eyes and slightly smiled as harry began to feel his worries slip away from him really allie asked i positive i dontsee any reason why i would be avoiding you harry commented so out of curiosity who would you have chosen to stay me or chloe allie asked with a smile slightly touching his arm i would have picked you harry answered then i guess it all worked out allie replied i guess so harry answered with a grin hermione had gone to the police station and silently followed the police to where they took chloe and watched to see where they placed her file and evidence she knew that she had to act quickly to take a peep at the file without arousing suspicion she came up with a quick idea and grabbed a cup of tea and pretended to trip and spilled the drink all over the receptionist i so sorry let me help you hermione exclaimed mortified that alright i ll go clean it up by myself just wait here the receptionist told her hermione nodded looking down and waited until she was gone when she went behind the desk and took the file and quickly noted down the address of the apartment and placed the file back and quickly went back outside just in time to see the receptionist come back so now what would you like she asked i wanted to have a chance to talk to someone that was just brought in her name is chloe hermione told her i ll see if she can have any visitors she replied dialing a number hermione waited a few moments as she processed the events of the day okay we ll let you see her for a few minutes the receptionist said as she hung up the phone hermione nodded and followed her into a small room and waited for a few moments before chloe entered the room hermione smiled a little as she watched chloe look of surprise hi chloe hermione said carefully what are you doing here chloe asked i here to see how you re doing hermione explained i doing as well as i possibly can here in holding chloe replied so what really happened hermione asked what do you mean chloe asked confused i mean i believe that you didnthave anything to do with lisa disappearance but i was just wondering what made you tell that lie to lisa hermione asked again honestly i dontknow it just felt like something that i had to do it just popped into my head out of nowhere and then i did it it was really strange and then today chloe started what happened today hermione asked i was just talking with allie last night and then i dontreally remember what happened afterwards and then before i knew it was time for the date chloe explained you dontremember anything hermione asked nothing totally blanked out chloe replied why didntyou tell the police that hermione asked because it would make me look even more suspicious chloe answered you re right it would do you have any recollection of the place they said that you went to hermione asked i dontremember it at all when they showed it to me do you think any of the other girls will come and visit me chloe asked i dontknow but did you want to talk to allie hermione asked slowly no i just wanted to know if anybody else was going to visit me that all chloe replied if it makes you feel any better i think that harry believes in you too hermione replied after a moment you think so chloe asked with a smile your time up the guard interjected i do and i will try to help you get out hermione told her don t please dontbother i sure that everything will work out because i didntdo it chloe replied i sure that it will but it doesnthurt to check it out hermione added hermione please don t chloe said before heading back inside hermione was quite shocked to hear that she didntwant her to help but shook it off as that she didntwant her to get hurt or go to so much trouble mind your own business if you know what best for you what hermione said and looked around and saw nobody but had the feeling that she was being watched and hurried out of the building thanks for believing in me harry allie told him no problem harry replied with a smile do you know where hermione is allie asked i have no idea but i sure that she around harry answered yeah allie answered looking around why are you so interested in hermione harry asked suddenly what allie asked taken aback it just that you always seemed interested in knowing where she is and i just was curious as to why you are that way harry added i am but because i want to be her friend and i think she great and i just want to get to know her better allie explained well hermione is a great person harry replied with a smile i think that you should take a chance and talk to christine now allie suggested are you trying to get rid of me harry asked in a teasing tone of course not but i wouldntwant to accused of hogging all of your time allie replied i was thinking of finding some time to chat with christine so i guess now is a good time i ll see you later harry asked i ll be waiting allie answered with a smile harry headed off to christine and said softly hey harry hi christine replied trying to smile how are you doing harry inquired i just feeling really sad christine answered the whole situation is horrible harry responded first of all i just cantbelieve chloe would do something like that i have spent all this time with her and we have really talked and i didntthink she was like that at all and then now lisa really disappeared christine added sadly dontbe so hard on yourself nobody could have seen this coming harry smoothly patted her on the back and it not only that really the whole thing is unbelievable i dontthink chloe would do something like this it just a gut feeling that i have and it usually isntwrong christine replied i dontthink that she has anything to do with either harry added i just hoping everything just gets sorted out soon and i really hope that they find lisa really soon i cantbelieve that she really missing i just talked to her a few days ago christine said sadly i sure that the police will do all they can and that she ll be found soon harry added i sorry but i just really emotional right now this situation reminds me of my last boyfriend and makes me really sad christine replied with a few tears come here harry said giving her a hug i really sorry but i canthelp thinking about it christine told her there no need to be sorry we re all upset about what happened and i think about one of my friends that passed on even now many years later harry replied christine pulled away after a little while and smiled thanks harry are you really okay harry asked i will be i going to be positive and thanks again christine replied i ll see you later then harry replied looking at his watch and then started to look around for hermione hermione was just looking at the address and knew that it had looked familiar it was at a place near where she had gone to meet joan but not the same place but pretty close this made her a bit suspicious so she decided to take a look inside she tried the door but it was locked so she unlocked it with her wand she stepped inside and saw that the place basically empty there were tables and chairs but it didntseem like anybody was actually living in the apartment she wanted to look for any sign of maybe lisa actually being there or chloe being there she spent quite a bit of time looking around and saw absolutely nothing but she didntwant to give up so she decided on using another strategy she decided to use a spell to see if anything had been hidden from her and she saw that nothing seemed to appear before her just then her phone rang and she picked it up hello hermione where are you harry asked concerned i investigating at this place hermione answered alone i told you to call me if you found anything harry scolded her gently relax harry i know what i doing and i haventfound anything substantial yet how about you hermione inquired nothing really harry answered you got nothing from allie hermione asked you know i ve been thinking that maybe allie didnthave anything to with this harry answered what i thought we have been over this she is the most likely person of the contestants to have anything to do with lisa disappearance hermione added well i agree with that but we donthave any evidence to say that she really did have anything to do with it harry added what about the fact that she is so interested in looking into me hermione pointed out well maybe she just wants to be your friend harry replied but researching me that not normal hermione countered maybe she does it because she wants to be thorough harry suggested okay just wait for me there something i need to tell you in person hermione replied with a heavy sigh see you in a bit harry added you idiot i told you to be careful hermione murmured to herself and apparated back to the mansion and walked inside and nearly jumped when she heard a voice say so what did you want to say to me harry you shouldntsneak up on people like that hermione scolded him i sorry about that but i just wanted to help you find what you were looking for harry replied with a smile and what was i looking for hermione asked a great looking guy harry answered where hermione asked looking frantically around ha ha okay i going harry replied walking away hermione pulled him back come here that what i talking about so what did you want to talk to me about harry asked did you get anything about what allie was chatting with chloe about hermione asked nothing special from what i heard is there something that i missing harry asked raising his eyebrows i was just chatting with chloe and she sounded really out of it and from what she told me she doesntremember what happened last night or why she did tell lisa that lie but the only thing she did remember was talking with allie hermione explained she doesntremember anything harry asked thoughtfully i thought that was strange as well because normally with blackouts it happens but you dontwake up dressed and just before the date hermione replied i see what you re getting at this does seem quite unusual and she didnttell the police because that would make her look more suspicious but logically doesntthat make it seem like maybe she could have done it harry asked softly if you just look at it like that then maybe you could be right but i happened to visit that place where she supposed met lisa and guess where it was hermione asked donttell it was over there harry asked surprised not exactly but it looked that place and it was really close to joan s apartment that cannot be a coincidence and pair that up with the fact that allie was the last person who talked to lisa and that leads to too many coincidences that dontadd up hermione commented you re right the more i think about it the more suspicious that she looks but we still donthave any proof and part of me still thinks that she didntdo it or at least she didntplan it alone harry said slowly sitting down you know she probably didn t i remember when i chatted with joan i saw allie and that she was in the mansion so she definitely didntmake the phone call from joan that means that somebody else made the phone call i remember seeing some figure in her room before that looked quite sinister hermione added well then she was probably corrupted harry added harry what exactly did she tell you hermione asked shaking her head well she told me that she knew that i was a wizard you know and she seemed so sincerely sad about chloe and the more we talked and my suspicious just felt like they werentimportant anymore i didnteven think about them anymore until you mentioned them again in that logical way that you did harry answered after all of your years of training and everything that you have seen you know that things arentalways what they seem and that people are more complicated than you thought hermione said softly i know but i just want to give her a fair chance innocent until proven guilty harry added she got to you didntshe hermione asked sadly dontlook at me like that its not that i dontbelieve you or have any suspicions about her i just dontwant to automatically condemn her harry explained what you say makes sense but my gut tells me otherwise hermione added i get it but dontworry about me so much i can take care of myself harry replied you ve been saying that for years and no i will never stop worrying about you hermione answered harry gave her a hug and they walked off in the direction of the hall silently you do know that you re very important to me right that i wouldntlet anybody hurt you harry whispered to her i know and you know that goes the same for me hermione said with a slight smile do you need me to do anything for you harry asked well now that you mention it i was hoping you could do me a favor hermione asked of course what is it harry asked i want to go back and take a look in that apartment again could you keep an eye on allie for me hermione asked i think that you shouldntgo back there alone i ll come with you harry protested i appreciate that you want to protect me but its more important to me that you keep an eye on allie could you do that for me please hermione pleaded fine but if you re not back in 30 minutes i ll come looking for you so you better give me the address too harry added i am a grown woman and i dontneed a curfew how about in a hour hermione asked i know you re capable but definitely not an hour 45 minutes and that final harry answered i love that you want to protect me but i d say that you better be careful yourself hermione added writing down the address like i have said i can take care of myself harry retorted yeah be careful around her and donttell her anything hermione reminded him i totally insulted i would never do anything to jeopardize you safety harry replied with mock anger i know that but you never know hermione added looking down no listen to me no matter what i will not do anything to hurt you our relationship is important to me you re important to me she could never break that no matter what spell she uses she cantchange what inside harry said seriously as he took her arm hermione nodded and walked away you trust me harry asked always hermione replied with a smile harry walked back inside and was looking around but he didntsee anybody around besides the crew if you re looking for either allie or christine i afraid that they re off in the studio doing some interviews and press stuff they wontbe back for a couple of hours the camera man said thanks for letting me know harry replied with a smile harry headed upstairs and had the sudden thought to take a look into allie room and do some work of his own and proceeded to head towards the room that he knew was allies the door was unlocked so he just walked inside he knew that there were cameras but he turned them off with a quick wave of his hand he didntknow what he was looking for or where to start so he started to go through drawers to see if he could find anything of interest so decided to look in the closet and with a wave of his wand he began to see a few items appear before him one was a notebook that appeared to be her journal as well as an old record player as well as a couple of boxes he opened the box first and found a few medals for great achievement in her studies as well as a few certificates for adoption and graduating from faerway s nothing telling him much about her so he opened the next box now this box was filled with different ids for different places as well as bugs and other equipment the next thing he opened hesitantly at first because after all a journal was supposed to be private but the pages he found were blank which meant that they were probably protected from prying eyes but he tried using a few different spells but nothing appeared and was about to try again but then he saw the record player blink which was quite odd and quickly hid himself as he watched an image pop up in front of him where have you been i haventheard from you in a month and i wanted to see how you were doing and i hope that you have given up on that idea you had before about looking for your family because i and your teachers at faerway dontthink that is the best way for you to heel we re really worried about you you have so much potential and future ahead of you dontthrow it all away an older women wearing a hood said what is she planning to do with her family that has gotten her so worried about allie harry wondered to himself hermione headed back into the apartment as quietly as she could because she didntwant to draw any attention to herself being the observant person that she was she quickly scanned the apartment and notice that some of the chairs had been moved and that somebody had come back home but looking around she realized that they must have left again she did another quick scan with her wand and this time noticed a few small bits of a fingerprint on the desk and used her fingerprint identifier as well as a bit of magic to lift it off the coffee table and in less than a minute it put out a picture of the person who owned one of the finger prints to be lisa and the other bits belonged to someone who wasntregistered in the database so lisa had been here but why would she come her and not go back to the mansion and who does the other fingerprint belong to she asked herself she then continued examining the furniture but found nothing she didntgive up though because she felt like she was missing a very important piece of the puzzle and decided to try to look for a secret room or something like that because people dontvanish into thin air she then started to search thoroughly by touching the walls to see if they triggered any doors appearing in front of her nothing seemed to happen so she then tried to move other objects around to see if that did anything once again nothing happened so she tried one last time to use magic to reveal objects and after trying a couple of different spells a box appeared in front of her which made her smile she opened the box and took out a book which she opened and finally a door opened and she walked inside it was extremely dark inside so she searched for a light and saw that in the room was a very large and complex computer laboratory with many different monitors and keys as wells as many different books some of which were on muggle topics but the majority of the books were on topics in the magical world as she continued to search around she thought she saw something hidden behind the back of one of the vents and saw that it was a cell phone being the curious person that she was she turned the phone on and used magic to unlock the phone and she looked through the phone numbers to determine who phone it was on the floor after looking through a few messages she found one as follows l meet me at 4330 birchirm road it important a she now knew that this was lisa phone so she must have entered this room but what actually happened she still did not know she then turned on the computer system and used one of her decryption programs to unlock the system and after about 20 minutes she finally go through i ve got to hand it to the maker of the system they made quite a difficult code or else it wouldnthave taken so long to break hermione murmured to herself she then looked through the files in the computer which were organized by day and time she looked through the files of a few of the days and saw nothing so she continued on to the more recent files and clicked onto the file from yesterday and at first the video showed nothing and was blank but then lisa appeared on the screen walking into the apartment and taking a seat she was looking at her watch as she was in a hurry to leave about 10 minutes allie had came in with a smile and said hi allie why did you ask me to come here is this place yours lisa asked i wanted to have a private chat with you and no this is my friend place and she was just away for a few days so i borrowed it allie replied with a smile okay what did you want to talk to me about lisa asked slightly fidgeting i just wanted to ask you a couple of questions allie replied so lisa asked what do you think about how chloe did to you allie asked at first i was upset about it but i think that it happened at the right time because it was the right time for me to go and visit her so it really turned out to be the right thing to do lisa answered so you re not mad at her anymore allie asked no i not in fact i should probably thank her lisa replied with a laugh that really good chloe really didntmean any harm when she did it i sure so why are you back allie asked i was hoping i could try to talk the producers to let me come back on the show lisa admitted you are allie asked sharply you donthave a problem with that do you lisa asked of course not if you can come back that would be awesome we ve all missed you but dontyou think that you re just pressing your luck allie inquired what do you mean lisa asked well it just makes things so much more complicated now we ve been filming ahead of time now and the show has moved on so if you came back it wouldntreally be fair to the rest of us and we would have to do a lot of things all over again allie replied i didntthink of it that way that would make things really complicated wouldntit lisa commented sitting down and then we would have to edit the stuff that has already been filmed and then explain why you came back and that would be against the rules allie pointed out that true but i still have to try or else i know that i ll regret it lisa said after thinking for awhile are you sure that you dontwant to reconsider allie asked i know you re trying to look out for me but it is going to be fine i have prepared myself for being rejected lisa told her so there nothing i can do to stop you is there allie asked i ve made up my mind so no lisa replied then i sorry allie said signaled a cloaked person come up behind lisa what lisa started before she fainted and fell to the ground allie just sat down and the cloaked figure removed the hood to review that it was chloe no it couldntbe hermione said to herself and stopped the video and began to look around for anything else to prove otherwise she then found hidden behind a stack of books a birth certificate for allison anne granger and behind it was a letter dear ms renshaw we have finally found your biological parents it was very difficult to do so but after many months we have finally traced back to england to a mr and mrs granger you also have a sister named hermione i have sent you all the information that i have found with this letter sincerely patrick mcflamboyle private investigation muggle division this isntpossible i donthave a sister it must be another hermione hermione told herself i thought so to but it all true a voice behind her said hermione turned around slowly and found herself staring at a dark figure who are you hermione asked that doesntmatter now because you re going to take a little nap the figure said and with a snap of the figures she was gone hermione began to feel sleepy and felt herself fall to the ground harry was looking at his watch and something in his gut told him that something was wrong and he quickly headed out the door please let her be okay harry thought to himself a n thanks so much to everyone for their wonderful reviews sorry for the long wait but it has taken me quite some time to find the best way to write it i hope that you guys enjoy this chapter and let me know what you think and review thank you so much disclaimer i dontown anything see previous disclaimers chapter 25 hermione woke up to find that her arms and legs were tied to a chair and looked around and saw that she was in a dark room without much furniture she also realized that she didntrecognize where she was and that her head was throbbing i see that you finally woke up how you head a familiar voice said hermione looked up to see allie sitting in front of her with her hair done up in little waves with a small smirk allie my head hurts but you seem to know something about that hermione answered i sorry about your head i told them to be more careful but they dontalways listen allie replied with a shrug i sure that you did and by the way where am i hermione asked rolling he eyes you re in a room specifically reserved for special guests like you allie replied with a small smile how nice of you allie but where exactly is here hermione replied with a scowl do you remember where you were last allie asked you mean that i still in the same apartment hermione asked you could say that in a way but more like underground but let cut the chit chat now and ask what you really want to ask me allie added looking nonchalantly at her nails are you the one behind lisa disappearance and chloe outburst hermione asked maybe i had a hand in moving those events along allie replied crossing her legs what does that mean hermione asked it wasntvery difficult the power of suggestion can do wonders especially with a bit of help from magic allie replied so basically you tricked her into it hermione retorted i wouldntuse the word tricked exactly it was her choice to do it in the end allie answered that twisting the truth hermione replied sharply it all about perspective your perspective may not always be right allie short back so what is your perspective then hermione asked raising her eyebrows chloe was getting quite nervous and feeling a bit guilty about something so i suggested that maybe a confession would help keep her conscience clean allie answered so you think that you were helping her then hermione commented if it makes her feel better then yes i think i did allie answered but she wouldnthave done it if you hadntmake her do it hermione added that where you re wrong allie said with a laugh what does that supposed to mean hermione replied well you obviously dontknow everything do you allie said with a laugh what are you talking about hermione pressed the magic i used on chloe doesntpull things out of thin air it is based on some thought in their minds allie explained you mean that it brings even the tiniest thoughts that cross their mind to their attention hermione inquired yes and it makes it more likely that they would do what they are thinking about allie added you mean basically they do things without thinking hermione pressed you could say that i guess allie replied just because you think of something doesntmean that they would actually do it hermione cried but you dontknow that do you allie asked not exactly but from what i can see hermione started what you see you donther that well allie scoffed and you do hermione countered better than you do and like i said that appearances can be deceiving allie retorted fine what happened to lisa hermione asked shaking her head since you have watched some of the video i ll keep it simple remember the call that i received for lisa allie asked hermione just nodded in response well she happened to mention that she was thinking about trying to come back so i just basically kept my eye on her metaphorically speaking of course allie replied what did you do to her hermione demanded i didntdo anything allie replied stressing the i well then where is she hermione asked again relax she just taking a very long nap allie answered hermione sighed in relief then asked just sleeping and was it really chloe who helped you yes it just a very very long nap for now it does look like chloe doesntit allie replied with a smile you mean it wasnther hermione inquired it is and it isn t allie answered standing up what does that mean hermione asked it means exactly what i say it means things arentalso what they seem allie responded stop trying to be so cryptic is it her or not hermione asked exasperated touchy arentyou yep you re right that it isntchloe but we didntuse any polyjuice potion to do it you have heard of people with the ability to transform into any shape that they want right allie replied amused hermione nodded and said so that was who we saw in the screen yep allie answered standing up but i dontget why you would do that to chloe hermione asked that would be partly your fault then wouldntit allie answered looking at her how is it my fault hermione retorted if it wasntfor you harry wouldntbe avoiding me and i wouldntbe forced to make sure that someone else went home and not me allie replied harry makes up his own mind so if he decided for himself that you might be the one for him then there isntanything i can do about it hermione answered but you can influence his decisions and obviously you told him about your suspicions about me allie countered fine then why did you do that to lisa hermione asked i didntwant to but she wouldntlisten to me when i asked her not to come back allie answered what does it matter though you know the rules and that there isnta way for to come back hermione pointed out i dontwant to take any chances and it wasntjust that allie answered what else did she say something that you didntlike or did she find something out about you hermione asked you think you are so clever dontyou you dontknow anything about anything allie added annoyed no major harm what about lisa family nobody knows where she is and you re taking away hours of her life and because you re letting chloe taking the blame for something that she didntdo you could cause her to have this accusation follow her for the rest of her life hermione said strongly it not like i planned to do it and it isntreally my fault allie retorted what is that supposed to mean hermione asked we re running out of time here so why dontyou ask what you really want to know allie replied after a moment of staring at her watch are you in a hurry or something hermione asked allie walked up closer to her and waved her hand all of a sudden hermione felt a sharp pain go through her and cried out in a gasp what was that hermione asked grimacing in pain just a little punishment for those who ask too many questions but if you keep your smart aleck comments to yourself then you wonthave to find out what more it can do allie replied hermione nodded and asked are you really my sister i wish it wasntrue but unfortunately we really are sisters allie answered but it not possible i would remember having a sister hermione answered slowly it like i want you for a sister either but it is the truth i wouldntmake something like this up and you did see for yourself while you were snooping around allie replied i do remember seeing something like this how did something like this happen hermione asked out loud in shock it quite simple they had to choose between the two of us and they chose to keep you allie replied choose between us for what hermione asked confused to send us off to be trained at faerway s allie answered i dontget why one of us would be sent off to faerway if we re both magical shouldntwe both be sent off to hogwarts hermione asked well i guess you dontknow everything do you then as you know that many prophecies made about every single person well there was one about the granger family one that mentioned that one of us was born to become a special magical individual who needed go for special training allie explained i ve heard that there are many prophecies concerning everybody but what i dontunderstand is why i dontremember any of it and my parents dontseem to remember either hermione asked obviously they erased me from your memories allie answered with a scoff that is obviously possible but i still dontbelieve that mum and dad would ever want to choose one daughter or another hermione answered since you know them of course you would say that well they obviously did since you re still living with them and i was shipped off to school far away allie explained bitterly i sure that there more to this story than you know since i dontthink you d remember everything since it was such a long time ago i sure that they would have wanted to keep you too hermione suggested you dontknow what happened either so maybe you shouldntsay anything allie replied sharply that may be true but you re acting like you know everything hermione pointed out have you ever thought that maybe i do know allie asked raising her eyebrows how would you know hermione asked i have my ways and my sources allie replied where hermione started to say before she felt a pain once again stop asking so many questions and just get up allie told her harry had been walking around trying to see if he could find hermione he tried looking into a few of the places that she had mentioned but he didntsee her and he asked around as well but so far still no luck he tried calling her phone but all it did was keep ringing which worried him more she was not someone who would leave her phone behind he remembered the one time she had almost forgot her phone she was back within a few minutes to pick it back up he laughed softly as he remembered how flustered she was at not being able to find her cell phone harry decided to try to find the apartment he had gone to with hermione he forgot what the exact address was though but he did remember the area where the apartment was and headed towards the apartment where are we going hermione asked some place where you can rest allie replied so how has your life been hermione tried again you really want to know allie sneered of course i do or i wouldnthave asked hermione replied i started school around when you were 10 and we began training the school work was tough and involved a lot of hard work luckily a couple of the teachers madeline and ms koucher helped me out and took care of me as their own if it wasntfor them i would not be able to have done as well as i had in school allie answered with a small smile it sounds like they treated you well hermione said softly they were really great but they werentmy parents allie said in a sad tone are you okay hermione asked softly mind your own business and keep on walking allie turned and snapped while giving her a slight push okay but can i ask you one more question hermione asked as she could walk forward you obviously wontgive up until you get all your answers wontyou go on and ask then allie replied shaking her head so how did you found me and why did you do it hermione asked i getting there i ve always known that i didntknow who my parents were and it never really bothered me until i heard other people starting talking about family and i think i heard them talking about my sister but they wouldnttell me so i hired someone to look into for me after nobody would tell me allie added patrick mcflamboyle right hermione asked i see that you were snooping around yes i hired him and after about a few days he finally found the name of my biological parents afterwards i began search for any smidge of information on you guys mum and dad were dentists and i only found little information on them but they apparently did pretty well and i found some articles on you in elementary school since you were quite an academic achiever i found that was quite strange so i began thinking that maybe you were also in the magical world and then i found out a lot about you just from reading the newspapers and books as well as people talking about all your latest accomplishments allie explained with a bitter tone in her voice you were asking about me hermione asked well i needed to know what type of person you were since we are related biologically at least allie replied and what was your impression of me hermione inquired i think that a lot of people think that you re a great person and on paper i would have to agree you ve always had this great life and a family some people might not be so lucky and resent that allie pointed out are you one of those people hermione asked i dontresent you for that but i definitely dontthink that its fair that you got everything perfect parents friends and fame allie shouted so you joined the show because of that hermione asked arrogant much everything isntabout you allie retorted then why did you join the show hermione asked for the same reason any other girl joins the show allie replied you want to find your perfect match hermione asked of course dontyou allie inquired of course so you didntknow harry joined the show at first hermione asked i didntknow but it worked out well because i did want to meet him allie added with a smile so you do like him hermione asked does that really matter now come on over here allie replied as the smile left her face and pushed her towards a narrow opening i really want to know hermione tried again rubbing her arm so what if i do my chances now are much slimmer since you told him to be wary of me allie responded with bitter tone to her voice how did you know that hermione asked i have my ways but it was quite obvious that you didntlike me very much so you would say something like that to him allie replied if you didntdo anything suspicious then there wouldntbe anything to be worried about hermione pointed out dontget on your high horse with me everything is your fault after all allie answered you cantkeep blaming everything on me hermione told her stop talking allie told her as she pressed a button to open the door you keep on saying that it not all your fault so is there someone else helping you hermione pressed just come on inside allie responded after a moment and grabbed her arm after she didntsee to move right away what is this place hermione asked looking around and seeing all there was a small enclosed space this is a place for you to rest in allie explained well that very nice of you but i dontneed to rest hermione responded as she looked around who said you had a choice allie asked what are you going to do hermione asked nervously relax for a bit and as long as you do as you re told everything will be fine allie told her with a bright smile you re not going to hermione asked get rid of you i wish i could but obviously if you really disappeared that would cause harry to worry and all so it not something that i can easily do allie replied with a laugh okay so where am i going to rest hermione asked i thought that i d let you take care of that yourself allie answered but my hands are tied how do you expect me to do anything hermione asked just then the phone rang and allie picked it back up and after a few moments she turned off the phone and turned towards her and said i will be back in a little bit hermione was curious as to whom she was talking to on the phone and started to figure out if she could get herself out of the rope that was around her legs and feet she began looking around the room to see if there was anything that she could use to loosen the rope around her hands but as she looked around she didntsee anything that was lying around and decided then to try a spell and mumbled losiado vibroso as she waved her hands it didntwork at first but then she tried it a few more times and finally it was successful and she was able to untie her feet and headed towards the door to find it blocked i knew it wouldntbe that easy hermione murmured to herself and tried a couple of unblocking charms and spells and seemed to have lessened its power but did not remove the whole obstruction frustrated she leaned against the wall and felt a loose brick in behind her and removed it to find a key pad and got shocked as she tried to press the buttons to unlock it hermione just sighed and quickly took out a pen she kept in her pocket for emergency situations it was device that she had helped to develop in order to use magically enhanced safes it was still not fully developed yet though since there were a few kinks to yet be worked out she then pressed the button and moved the pen over the keypad as if she was spraying something there seemed to be a spark appeared and she smiled she then opened the lid on the pen and pulled out another small device and attached that to the keypad setting in the program to find the combination on the lock and within a few minutes the blockage disappeared and she quickly waved her hand and everything went back to her pocket and she walked out of the room extremely quietly harry went to the neighborhood but all their apartments looked the same so he checked out a few apartments before he finally found the one that was now empty and looked around and saw nothing out of the ordinary but he still felt like something was wrong so he tried calling hermione again and that when he heard a small beeping sound and he investigated to find that the sound seemed to have originated from behind the wall indicating that there must be a hidden compartment somewhere in the apartment he then did a quick scanned the wall and found the position in the wall and took out his wand and cast a little unlocking revealing spell that acts on opening any secret compartments it is a very useful spell that saves a lot of time in determining how to unlock the door to the secret compartment within a couple of minutes the door to the security room appeared in front of him and he walked inside the room and tried to spot where hermione cell phone may be and dialed it again and within a couple of minutes he found the phone near the door and by now he was certain that something bad had happened to her her phone was a little battered and opened which was so unlike hermione he then searched for an opening that could led into a secret passage the room looked clean and there were no boxes anywhere it looked like nobody had lived there for ages but he had a feeling that she would be still be nearby so he continued searching through the floor boards or any hiding places in the wall harry took his wand out once again and tried using another spell that he had used numerous times before and finally saw some movement in behind one of the mirrors he did find it strange that there was a mirror in this room and decided to see if he could move the mirror and found that it was closed quite shut so he used his wand to loosen the mirror and the mirror opened slightly and harry easily moved the mirror out of the way and saw that it led to a narrow staircase and harry followed silently downstairs hermione heard some voices coming from another room a few feet away and moved closer to see who was having the conversation do i really have to do that allie asked yes that is part of our deal another face replied but that wasntpart of the original plan allie replied a lot of things happened that werentin the original plan so things had to change the person replied but it not exactly how i wanted it to go allie commented i know but in the end the result should be the same that person added but i not really sure if it will work allie commented we have a lot of faith in you and i sure that you will do a good job that person added hermione tried to move in closer to see who allie was talking to and accidentally tripped on something and when she looked up she saw that other person was no longer there what are you doing out here allie demanded you didntexact me not to try to escape hermione replied of course not but i would have thought that you would have already left allie replied with a shrug i didntactually think that i would get caught and dontexpect me to stay here either hermione added as she moved away you re not going anywhere allie told her as she went to go grab her arm hermione shook it off and kicked her and ran forward allie grimaced and took out her wand and pointed towards hermione hermione doubled back and turned around feeling the pain and took out her wand and said tremiosa allie stood still and grabbed her leg hermione took this opportunity and said expelliamus allie wand went off far away from her and she said i cantlet you leave unless you promise to keep everything you learned here a secret you know that i cantdo that hermione told her as she continued forward quickly well then you cantleave allie said quietly with a wry smile hermione continued forward but she didntseem to be getting any closer to the exit all the entry ways seemed to look alike so she tried to use her own senses to find her way out of the mess when she found a door at the end of the tunnel and grabbed the door and the atmosphere became black and blurry and she felt herself falling until she landed in a room on her feet and became quite unbalanced and landed on the bottom are you comfortable a cloaked figure asked who are you hermione asked the cloaked figure laughed and took off to reveal her face she had sleek black hair dark eyes and pale hair that very much resembled bellatrix estrange and said you cantbe you re locked up hermione asked shocked you re right i not she said with a smile then who are you hermione asked i her daughter carlineux she replied but as far as i can tell she didnthave any kids hermione replied well you didntknow you had a sister either did you carlineux retorted do you know allie hermione asked of course i know her we ve gotten to be pretty good friends and let you know on a little secret carlineux replied what hermione asked allie doesnteven know that she is only playing a part in our plan carlineux added with a laugh what plan hermione asked standing up sit down carlineux ordered and with a wave of her hand a chair appeared behind hermione and she sat down what plan hermione asked rubbing her ribs everything has been planned quite in detail first of all the fact that harry was picked to be the bachelor and allie getting picked as well carlineux added you mean it was all a set up hermione inquired well not everything i happened to meet allie at school we just told her a little lie and showed her a little of what happened we told her that your parents chose to give her up instead of you carlineux explained why hermione asked because we needed her when i spotted her i thought that she reminded me of you carlineux replied how did you remind you of me if you have never met me hermione asked i learned a long time ago who i was and i also found that they didntthink of me as a daughter at all because i wasntborn like them i wanted them to like me so i was reading all about how you and harry has been labeled as heroes so i thought of a wonderful way for them to like me and it involved both you and harry carlineux explained so why do you need allie for part of your plan hermione asked trying to get up but her feet were unwilling to move stop trying to move it wontwork because is allie is the most like you carlineux explained what does that have to do with anything hermione inquired you will soon find out carlineux replied with a mysterious smile allie ran into the room and whispered something in carlineux ear you re in luck you know what we were just talking about you ll have your answer soon carlineux told her hermione just looked up at her with curiosity get up harry on his way carlineux told her with a wave on her hand he here and you re not at all concerned hermione asked we re going to give him a test to see how well he knows who you are carlineux replied what kind of test hermione asked why dontyou turn around carlineux asked hermione turned around and saw herself what is going on hermione asked herself in shock a n thanks to you guys for all your incredible reviews thank you so much for all your comments i really love to hear what you think so please enjoy and i hope you review disclaimer i dontown anything chapter 26 hermione looked very carefully at the person before her she really did look like her down to the tiny strand of hair stuck behind her ear you look surprised carlineux told her with a smile who is that hermione asked it you carlineux answered no you got someone to look like me hermione retorted touch my dear want to give a good guess to who she is carlineux asked well she seems to have most of my habits down so i guessing that she would be allie hermione replied you are correct carlineux replied and how does that fit into your plan hermione demanded it just a little test to see how well harry knows you carlineux answered and that all there is to it hermione asked well there a few conditions to this little game carlineux replied what kind of conditions hermione asked well first of all is that harry cantspeak to you and he only has 3 minutes to make his decision carlineux answered three minutes that seems to be quite short hermione said so maybe you arentsuch good friends after all then if you are worried carlineux replied raising her eyebrows of course not harry knows me better than anyone hermione commented then you have absolutely nothing to worry about carlineux replied is there something that i should be worried about hermione countered well there is one little catch in this game carlineux answered what kind of stakes hermione asked well whoever harry chooses gets to live carlineux replied what you mean that you are going to kill whoever he doesntchoose hermione asked with shock well maybe not kill but that person wontget to leave carlineux answered slowly what do you mean by that hermione replied well you re not sounding very confident about your chances carlineux replied pushing hermione slightly forward i not worried really it just i feel like it not fair to keep anyone here hermione answered looking over at the other hermione oh you worried about your sister how sweet carlineux replied sweetly i dontneed your sympathy the allie answered curtly what do you plan to do with other person who isntpicked hermione pressed again you really are one curious girl you ll find out soon enough carlineux answered pushing her on her back hermione was about the say something else until she reached the room and was stopped and caught a glimpse of a familiar head of hair hi harry carlineux said harry turned around and asked who are you carlineux smiled and opened her hood as he saw her face he took in a sharp intake of air and said but you re let keep this short i not her i carlineux carlineux answered so who are you and where hermione harry asked in a loud tone now we re getting to the point of our meeting carlineux with a smile so you do have her harry added yes i do and you can have her back carlineux told him then where is she harry demanded just have a little patience she ll be here shortly carlineux answered and i can just have her back just like that harry asked again well there is one condition which you will find out soon carlineux replied just then harry saw hermione come into the room he smiled in relief but in a few seconds it vanished as he saw another hermione enter the room what is going on here harry asked it just a little game carlineux replied what are the rules harry asked after a moment it very simple actually carlineux answered what are they harry demanded it just that you have to pick the right hermione in 4 minutes carlineux replied and what happens to the other person harry inquired she will have to stay here for awhile carlineux and those are the only rules harry asked well there one other little one you can ask questions but they canttalk carlineux added then how are they supposed to respond harry asked well you can ask questions without requiring them to talk in response i sure you ll find a way carlineux answered waving her hand i know that i will find a way harry said your time starts now carlineux replied looking down at her watch harry walked towards both hermione and studied both of them carefully they both had that long brownish busy hair their hair was also done up very similarly they were similar down to the where a loose stray hair stood he knew hermione extremely well so he was pretty sure he would be able to determine which was the real hermione but he had to use a different approach after watching hermione for many years he knew almost every single habit that she had and decided to try and test out one of those habits he walked around each hermione and observed how she reacted to this scrutiny the first hermione stood still and tilted her head back with a few seconds before moving her back again the other hermione stood there for a few moments and placed her hands on her hips slightly and then crossed her arms and placed them back down although their movements are different both of those reactions were actually the way that hermione might react under different circumstances he had a feeling or an inkling to which person was his hermione but he wasnta hundred percent sure at this stage he decided to try something else then he said i was hoping that you could smile and laugh for me both of the girls shrugged and nodded the first hermione smiled and gave a small smile at first and then it grew into a wider smile and gave a soft and light laugh the next hermione gave a small bemused smile and then laughed nervously harry then nodded his head and stared between both women and smiled you have less than a minute left carlineux spoke up i know harry replied looking her straight in the eye and he pulled out knife what are you planning to do with that carlineux asked raising her eyebrows i just trying to figure out who the real hermione is harry replied swinging the knife around and how might you do that carlineux asked with a smile why dontyou two girls stand over there harry asked pointing to a spot a few meters away both of the girls moved hermione was quite curious as to what harry had up his sleeve but he looked pretty confident which made her smile since there is less than a minute left i already know which of you is really hermione harry added you do well then which one is it carlineux prompted i ll let you know but first i want both of you two girls to move over there harry answered pointing towards a location a few feet from the wall both girls nodded and moved towards that harry then paced in front of both girls and looked at both of them once more and then he walked in front of one of them and pulled out the knife now i ve already figured out that you arenthermione and that maybe i should teach you a lesson harry told her harry raised his arm and aimed the knife right at her face and threw it right at her that hermione did not move one single inch and stood there with a determined look in her eye the knife came really close but just missed her be approximately 1mm he smiled and then said you should have moved a little bit you scared me a bit hermione smiled and responded i trust you and i can tell when you mean business now that is hermione harry responded with a smile so you were just lying before about knowing the other hermione asked no i just wasnt100 sure but i was 99 sure and now i am sure harry replied so you were just playing us the other hermione replied i wouldntsay that i was playing with you guys after all didntyou say that this was a game harry asked with a grin yeah you did say that and why dontyou go back to your original look hermione asked i agree one of hermione is enough harry commented what does that supposed to mean hermione said glaring at him i just mean that the world only needs one of you harry answered with a smile i dontknow if i should take that as a compliment or an insult hermione replied rolling her eyes i sure that you ll figure it out harry replied enough the other hermione said as she returned back to allie isntit nice to be yourself again harry asked well i ve always liked being me allie answered back that good why dontyou stay that way then hermione asked why what are you afraid of allie shot back allie carlineux said allie just nodded so we can just go now right harry asked be my guest carlineux answered with a smile let go hermione harry told her and started to walk off hermione looked towards allie and back to harry and just stood there what are you waiting for harry inquired we cantleave yet hermione stated why harry asked we cantleave allie here hermione said walking towards him why not harry asked we cantjust leave anybody here and what are we going to tell the producers if allie doesntcome back hermione asked that might be a bit tricky but i sure we ll think of something harry replied harry hermione said are you coming harry asked turning to give her a look as if saying it ll be fine trust me hermione looked back at him and back and allie and carlineux and walked right up to harry and he placed his arm around her shoulder and they walked back together it ll be fine harry whispered in her ear hermione just sighed but continued to walk and nodded hermione carlineux said hermione stopped towards her and said yes if you want answers then ask your parents carlineux said hermione stared for a moment and then continued on out at harry urging i cantbelieve you just let them leave allie said to carlineux have patience allie it ll all work out carlineux calmly responded what is your plan allie asked just wait and you ll find out what you need to know carlineux replied harry what do you mean by everything will be fine hermione asked once they got back to harry loft it will all work out i mean allie and carlineux obviously know each other already harry answered you re right about them knowing each other but still hermione said thoughtfully i sure that she will be taken care of harry added that what i worried about hermione commented since she is part of their plan i sure that they have thought that this could happen they wontdo anything to her since she is part of their group harry told her taking a seat on the couch even so wait a minute you seem so sure about this how do you know that they are part of the same group hermione asked wasntit obvious i mean she was part of the game and she listened to carlineux harry answered after a moment maybe but maybe there is something that you haventtold me yet hermione said walking towards him what about you why do you seem to be so worried about allie all of a sudden harry countered i asked you first hermione answered i dontknow anymore than you do harry told her that not true how do you know that she will be alright with them hermione asked again it just a feeling that i have harry answered no it not just that i can see it in your eyes why wontyou tell me hermione asked with a touch of urgency in her voice hermione please i ve told you everything that i can just trust me okay harry asked i do you know i do but i really need to know everything hermione answered firmly why cantyou just trust me on this harry asked getting up and pacing about because this time it concerns family hermione answered whose family harry asked confused well as it turns out i have a sister hermione explained you ve never had a sister harry reminded i didntthink so either but apparently i do and allie is my sister hermione explained are you sure about that harry asked what do you mean hermione responded raising her eyebrows i absolutely had no idea that allie was your sister harry told her taking a moment to grab a seat at the table you really didntknow hermione asked no i didn t i still cantbelieve it how do you know this harry asked flabbergasted well i found an old birth certificate of hers that said she was born to my parents and allie told me hermione explained did you examine the certificate they re really easy to fake you know harry replied no i didn t i didnthave any time but she had a pretty respectable detective on the case and he found that what makes you think that she make something like that up hermione said in an agitated tone it just that i find that really hard to believe that she is your sister and all of sudden she shows up harry asked okay so i not 100 sure but it doesntseem like something she would have made up and it doesnteven really matter we can sort that out later she really believes that she my sister though and what makes you so sure hermione asked grabbing a seat next to him i can only tell you what i know and even i dontknow all of it okay harry asked i understand just tell me what you do know hermione replied nodding with understanding well basically we ve received some information from some sources about certain alert levels rising these last few months so we ve all been made aware to keep an eye for any suspicious behavior and in fact there has been some activity found around in muggle areas so when they found out i was chosen to be part of this show to keep an eye out for anybody suspicious it was just a tiny warning so i didntsay anything to them at first harry explained okay i understand that then what happened hermione asked well at first nothing was really reported but lately there has seen to be a pattern in abnormal activity in the area activity not normally seen around this area so we were told to monitor thing more carefully especially receiving some anonymous tips about maybe more witches or wizards or other magical beings being seen around the area harry continued from who hermione asked we don t actually know but they ve said that their information has been solid for quite some time so it best to listen so after some surveillance we ve had our eye on a few people harry replied which people have you been watching hermione asked well we ve been watching a few people closely we ve been watching allie and chloe mainly in the contestants and a few of the crew members as well harry answered when did you start watching allie hermione asked around the time you told me about your suspicions harry answered exactly when hermione asked actually a few days before you told me your suspicions harry replied with a sheepish grin so you already had suspicions about her and you didntlet me know hermione asked a little bit angry and stood up and walked towards the wall i wanted to but then how would i explain keeping her around harry asked walking towards her you could have still let me know did you even know how you made me feel hermione asked turning to face him i know and i sorry but i did tell you to trust me harry reminded her and i do you know that but it still doesntmake it right hermione remarked i sorry but you do understand that it not that i didntwant to tell you but i couldn t we needed to keep allie around so that we could continue monitoring her harry explained and what did you find out hermione asked after a moment we noticed that she had been having secret meetings almost every other night and we slowly followed her harry answered who did she meet and where did she go for these meetings hermione asked we never actually managed to see who she was meeting but they never seemed to meet at the same location twice harry replied so what did you find out hermione asked puzzled we did find out that she always met with people from the same group we know that because they all wore the same outfit but their faces were always covered we suspect that this group consists of the remaining supporters of voldemort harry explained do you guys really think so hermione asked it makes sense especially seeing carlineux there harry answered so what are you planning on doing hermione asked well we decided that we were going to watch allie and she ll lead us to where they are gathering and maybe give us some insight into why they are gathering and what their plans are harry replied why didntyou ask me for help hermione asked because we didntwant to get you involved you were never supposed to be involved harry answered i could have helped you beside you knew that i was suspicious of allie so i would have looked into her anyways hermione added yes i know you would but we wanted to keep your distance as much as possible but it looks like now that it is not possible harry answered you should have let me help you it would make the most logical sense for me to have been trailing her hermione replied it would have been really dangerous and we didntwant anything to happen to you harry countered i can take care of myself you know that better than anybody hermione countered but you would also be the person that she would most likely be on the lookout for since she knew that you were wary of her harry added okay you may have a point there but you should have warned me if you thought she was really dangerous hermione added i did i told you not to do anything crazy without me harry reminded her i dontthink that means the same exact thing but what is the plan now hermione asked well we have a clue as to where they might be holding lisa and basically we were planning on breaking in and retrieving those that may have been captured harry explained so that why you were rushing us out and what do you know about allie involvement with them hermione inquired yes that is why i wanted to figure out their location as quickly as possible harry answered so when are you guys going in hermione asked slowly i not sure yet but within the next couple of days just in case they decided to regroup elsewhere harry explained so does knowing allie is my sister change anything hermione asked pointedly the fact that she your sister does cause some complications but the truth is i still find it very surprising but from the information that we have been gathering from various sources it does seem like they have something huge planned and from what we can see allie seems to be quite important in those plans so if that were the case they wontdo anything to her harry answered well from what i gather though is even though they do seem to include allie in on their plans from what she has told me and her tone in her voice i donttrust her and allie just feels abandoned and they opened up to her so she feels comfortable there she probably thinks it a place where she belongs hermione commented sitting down do you trust what she has told you harry asked i know that allie believes what she saying i dontthink she really knows what she is doing as for carlineux i donttrust her there is something odd about her but i do think she is being somewhat truthful but she is definitely hiding something hermione replied what do you think she hiding harry asked softly i dontknow but she told me to talk to my parents it all very confusing hermione answered leaning her head against his shoulder hermione what are you going to do about allie harry asked slowly brushing her hair out of her way i dontknow i cantlet her get off with everything she done but i really think that deep down she good but she just got turned the wrong way but i dontwant to have to send her off to azkaban or jail because she been through so much and been along so long i want to be there for her and show her that i care and i want to be there i dontwant her to hate me but if i dontthen i m hermione replied frustrated harry lifted her head and placed his head against his forehead and said hey dontworry you ll do the right thing and she ll see that you re doing this for her own good you ve got the biggest heart in the world and something you have to do what you have to do because you care she ll understand someday i promise you hermione smiled and closed her eyes and placed her head back on his shoulder harry placed his arm around her and kissed her on the forehead they stayed like that for a few minutes in silence so what do you want to do now harry inquired i think i need to talk to my parents hermione replied do you really think they know something harry asked softly i dontknow but as you know impossible things have been happening for a long time hermione pointed out whatever you want to know i ll be there if you want me there harry spoke up of course i want you there i was hoping i wouldnthave to go alone hermione responded with a huge grin harry handed her the phone and said what are you waiting for can we really go now hermione pointed out harry grabbed the phone and dialed a number quickly hi i feeling sick today i dontthink that i can film the show today hermione just looked at him and smiled how sick harry said and began coughing very loudly buy pointing the wand at his throat hermione grabbed the want from his hand a minute later shaking her head thanks harry croaked into the phone you do know that a wand is not a toy you know hermione explained i know that but i wanted to really sound sick harry answered rubbing his throat and if you had that wand on you any longer your voice might actually be shot hermione replied laughing i did this for you harry retorted in between coughs i know and i grateful but honestly i would have thought by now you would know better hermione added in between giggles and waved her wand a glass appeared on the table and harry took it raising his eyebrows it ll cure your throat hermione explained it doesntlook that appetizing harry replied staring at the brownish green color just drink it hermione told him rolling her eyes harry took the drink and quickly gulped it down and then sank down to his knees it doesnttaste that bad hermione commented with a giggle and handed him something harry took it and smiled she had given him some of his favorite strawberry flavored candies and he popped it in his mouth you re lucky that i brought you any hermione replied i know you always keep them on hand harry teased her only because i know you ll get into trouble hermione retorted back okay so are you ready to make that call harry asked after a few moments hermione grabbed the phone and dialed her parents number hello mum hermione asked nervously hermione mrs granger said it me hermione replied how are you doing dear mrs granger asked delighted in hearing her daughter voice i good but i wondering if harry and i could drop by for a visit hermione asked of course i ll be home in about half an hour she replied will dad be there as well hermione asked yes he will be home then as well is something wrong mrs granger asked worried no everything is fine i just want to see the both of you i ll see you in a bit then hermione replied cheerfully okay see you then mrs granger replied quite puzzled so we re all set harry asked slowly walking towards hermione i a bit nervous it going to be quite surprising to them and i have no idea what they will tell me hermione replied nervously whatever they re going to tell you we ll get through and it doesntchange the fact that they re your parents and that they love you harry told her rubbing her shoulders you re right how did you get to be so calm and rational hermione asked teasingly it comes from being nagged at day and day out for so many years harry answered seriously hermione pushed you playfully and said if it wasntfor my nagging i doubt that you would have survived school year after year see that earned a smile harry replied with a grin at my expense but i forgive you this time hermione responded smiling back are you ready harry asked hermione nodded and they headed off to meet her parents a n thanks for everyone great reviews and for the long wait but i had computer problems i hope this chapter explains everything a bit more clearly just for everyone information i thinking about 4 or 5 more chapters before this story is done i thinking of doing a sequel if anybody is interested please review and let me know what you think thanks so much everyone discliamer i dontown harry potter or the bachlelor this fic is for entertainment purposes only chapter 27 hermione stood in front of her childhood home just staring at the door she was beginning to get a bit worried about what she might find out hey are you okay harry asked her gently not really i really nervous and worried about talking to my parents about this hermione admitted what exactly are you afraid of harry prodded gently i afraid of what they ll say what they wontsay what if i dontlike what they are going to say and what tell me changes everything hermione replied that may be true but you do know that some things will never change right harry asked of course i do they ll always be my parents and that they love me right hermione asked i did guess that you would know that harry answered sheepishly i know but still it scary i donteven know where and how to start hermione confessed well think of this as something that i have to do and i was asking you for advice what would you tell me to do harry tried hm let me think about this for a second then i guess i would tell you to start slowly and offer hints and then see how to go from there hermione replied after a few minutes then you should be telling yourself that harry told her hermione nodded and took a deep breath and used the key that she had in her pocket to open the door and then knocked hermione and harry walked into the room together and closed the door hermione mrs granger voice called out yes mum hermione said and walked into the kitchen and gave her mum a hug would you guys like some tea mrs granger asked sure hermione told her what about you harry mrs granger asked warmly tea will be great harry told her with a smile so why are you visiting mrs granger asked with a smile is dad home yet hermione asked he ll be down in a few minutes have some cookies how are you harry mrs granger asked as she offered him the plate thanks things are going good different but good harry answered i would imagine that being on the show like that is quite out of the ordinary mrs granger replied with a laugh how are you enjoying it hermione mrs granger asked it going alright its quite fun sometimes and i have made a few friends hermione answered that good mrs granger told her daughter you re here already mr granger said as he walked in dad its good to see you what took you so long hermione asked standing up to give him a hug you were always early so what was the reason for your visit mr granger asked how are you doing sir harry asked good and how are you doing mr granger said i doing well sir harry answered well dad i wanted to tell you some interesting stories that i heard from someone hermione answered oh really what was it mrs granger asked well apparently somebody that i knew actually found out that they had a sister that they never knew they had hermione began really that kind of stuff really happens mr granger asked with a laugh yes she felt that it was impossible because she never remembered having a sister her parents didnteither hermione continued looking for any sign of recognition from either of her parents faces so how did that happen mrs granger asked curiously well apparently they gave up her sister for adoption and decided to forget about it hermione replied i guess that is possible but very unlikely and unusual mr granger complimented hermione looked towards harry who shrugged i met a very interesting girl on the show hermione continued really what is she like mr granger asked well she a lot like me she smart and pretty but she has had quite a hard life she was given up at birth hermione answered oh that terrible but i sure that her parents didntwant to do it mrs granger added why would you say that hermione asked eagerly i speaking as a parent every parent loves their kid and wants to do what best for them mrs granger explained did you ever want to have another daughter hermione asked i know that you have always wanted a sister and i think it would be nice but it just never happened why are you asking mr granger asked i was just curious you know if i had a sister what would you name her hermione asked that is quite easy i would name her allison ali for short mrs granger replied really allison hermione asked her eyes widening i dontwhy i want to name her that though it a name that always been on my mind allison anne grange it has a nice ring to it doesntit mrs granger answered mr granger nodded and replied i ve always liked that name myself i know a person that has that name hermione commented really that such a coincidence mr granger replied does the name faerway school for the gifted mean anything to you hermione tried again no did you ever go there mr granger asked no dear i thought she went to hogwarts mrs granger said i did go to hogwarts are you sure it doesntring a bell at all hermione asked standing up harry walked over to hermione placed a hand on her shoulder urging her to calm down hermione dear what is it mr granger asked looking worried are you absolutely sure that i donthave a sister hermione asked of course we re sure i think that we would know if something like that happened mrs granger answered laughing slightly is there anything that you arenttelling me i know that you re doing it for my own good and i wontbe mad hermione tried again no we re not keeping any secrets from you where is all this coming from are you okay mrs granger asked concerned i fine really are you sure you haventheard of faerways it a school for fairies and other magical individuals hermione added it doesntring any bells but then again a lot of the magical stuff in your life doesntmake much sense for me mr granger replied apologetically could you think a little bit harder hermione pleaded is it important to you that we do mrs granger asked yes hermione answered simply are you alright harry asked it just that i feel like they must know something that name did not come out of the blue they would have named her allison anne granger that is her name hermione answered that does sound quite suspicious but they really do sound like they dontknow anything harry told her looking at her parents i know but it so frustrating because i really feel like there is something that i need to know i know that i shouldnttrust what carlineux told me but it really does seem to fit right now hermione answered i know what you mean i wish there was something that i could do for you harry replied looking at her being here is already helping a lot hermione told him and gave his hand a quick squeeze i sorry but nothing comes to mind mr granger suggested apologetically mrs granger said i dontseem to recall anything about faerdays or anything like that it okay how about i show you something on the computer hermione asked having a sudden thought sure you can use my computer which is on the table mr granger told her what are you doing harry whispered i thought that maybe it might jog their minds if they saw something hermione whispered back and walked towards the table that my hermione i knew that she would think of something harry thought to himself as he watched her hermione turned on the computer and went into typed in the search terms that she wanted to use and came to a webpage and click on it what did you want to show us mr and mrs granger asked i wanted to show you some information on faerways it a school that trains fairies and other magical beings hermione explained that sounds like a very interesting school mrs granger commented hm this page looks quite different hermione murmed to herself as she came to black page what wrong harry asked i clicked onto the link for the page and nothing is showing up it wasntlike it was before hermione explained are you going to try loading the page again harry asked hermione clicked it again and this time a box popped up asking for a student name what are you going to put in mr granger asked hermione sighed and typed in allie renshaw once she typed that in another box popped up asking for their relation for that she typed in sibling once she done that it opened up to faerway welcome screen why dontyou two sit down hermione suggested mr granger shrugged and sat down and clicked onto the opening page the opening page was similar to the page that hermione came across herself but it had very slight differences one may difference was the flashing of the words on the screen then a video started to play welcome to faerways school for the gifted we will ask you to take a moment and enjoy the next clip the voice said the video clip started and lasted about a minute but all it played were a few different images of certain people and fruit when it was over hermione noticed that her parents had stood up and their faces seemed quite shocked hermione quickly tapped them on the shoulder and asked are you guys okay mr granger shook his head and said i starting to remember things yes i starting to get flashbacks to something too mrs granger replied flashbacks what are they about hermione asked well little things like holding a tiny baby and smiles and laughter mr granger replied what about you mum hermione asked about the same thing but i also remembering some cloaked individuals mrs granger added hermione looked up at harry and raised her eyebrows harry shrugged in response are these memories hermione asked mr and mrs granger a voice called out hermione looked around and saw nobody so she walked around trying to determining where the voices are coming from look towards the computer screen the voice said hermione turned her head towards the voice and followed it towards the computer screen and saw a middle aged man on the screen hi hermione the middle aged man said do i know you hermione asked surprised i not surprised that you dontremember me at all after all we only met very briefly when you were very young the middle aged man answered well hello mark mr granger replied with a smile you know him hermione asked her dad curiously yes we do how are you doing mark mrs granger asked how do know him hermione asked anxiously we ve only seen him once actually things are starting to come back to me mr granger replied thoughtfully what things can someone explain this to me hermione asked looking back and forth between her parents let me try and begin then mark replied okay hermione said turning her attention towards him she didntfeel any negative vibes toward him but she was still a little bit cautions well first of all you need to know that you come from a very special family a very long time ago as you know muggles and wizards all lived together rather peacefully although there were very few wizards around however as you know people are afraid of things that they do not know or understand so eventually the worlds were separated however there were a far more muggles than wizards so in order to make sure that magic continually assisted the decided to appoint an individual that would know all about the magical world in order to make sure that it continually existed mark explained i understand that in order for the magical world to assist someone will have to know that it exists so is this family a muggle family then hermione asked yes you are correct however they dontknow that they actually know anything the job just gets passed down each year until it was needed this was your family job mark answered really hermione asked yes dear that is the truth mrs granger replied but from what you say then would you say that it is strange that i am magical hermione inquired yes it was rather puzzling but we re sure that there was a reason for that but it could have also just happened randomly which does happen ever so often mark explained okay then but how do they know you hermione asked again i getting there now basically your family is in charge of protecting magic another interesting event occurred a few years after you were born as you know many prophecies have been made one other interesting one mentioned the creating of a unique magical individual that holds the secrets of the creation of magic now i am a member of the council that watches over both the magical and muggle world to keep things in balance so we noticed that a surge of energy came from england so we went to go investiage and that was when we found a baby sitting there we could tell by looking that she contained a lot of power and magic we knew that if she came into the wrong hands that it could be very dangerous for the everyone so we wanted to make sure that she was protected and taught right so we placed her in your family care for a few years mark revealed yes i remember those months they were really great i rememberd how much i had wanted another daughter so we were both thrilled to take care of her mrs granger replied yes she was very sweet and cute and our time with her was too short mr granger added how come i dontremember any of this hermione questioned how could you you were much too young mrs granger replied softly so what happened next hermione asked well then mark came over and introduced himself with a couple other people and told us the situation he told us that allison was extremely gifted and that in order to further her skills that she should be sent off for special training that we couldntprovide for her mrs granger explained we didntwant to but they told us that it would best for her if we did that so we reluctantly let them take her mr granger continued we could tell that they loved her so we also told them that however that it would be best if they dontremember anything about this girl for their safetly as well as for her but we dontreally like to erase memories completely so we just blocked it for the time being mark added blocking it you mean keeping the memories from being recalled very easily without being stimulated hermione asked yes you are quite smart as expected mark replied with a smile but how are you able to do that we have only managed to use modifying charms for years harry questioned ah that a good question harry but we re not the same as you our abilities work differently from your abilities we are able to use our magic to do things that most wizards can t mark explained so basically what happened was that somewhere the video and voice triggered their memories hermione asked yes that is what happened basically we had set up a network in your house in order for you guys to access or data because we knew that one day you would want to know everything mark replied so that why when i used my dad computer that it opened up to a different webpage hermione replied exactly mark answered with a smile what is she like mrs granger asked allie she is a really sweet girl and incredibly bright but she was never a really social person mark answered are you saying she didnthave very many friends mr granger asked she only had a couple of friends but they seemed to get along great mark answered i hope you dontme asking but do you know anything about the group of people allie is hanging out with now harry piped in actually we have heard about that and have done a bit of investigating ourselves for a few years we dontknow who the leader is exactly but apparently this woman named carlineux is of pretty high rank mark answered what have you guys found out hermione asked eagerly well from what we heard they are sort of mysterious but they dontseem to have been doing much so we re guessing that they are planning something big we have heard that many of their members have relations to the death eaters mark told them so do you have any idea what they are planning harry asked well we re thinking since they have been so good to allie that it might have something to do with her mark replied what do you mean they have been good to allie mrs granger asked the last time that allie spoke to one of her old teachers she told them that they taught her many things and were treating her well and not to worry about her mark added do you think that allie is actually bad hermione asked i think that deep down that she has a good heart but she has been led to believe certain things such as revenge and resentment she doesntmean to do any harm so you donthave to worry so much abour her mark replied thoughtfully with a smile so can i ask why she switched schools during her last year hermione asked well that was her choice but we do encourage everyone to try and fit into the muggle world as well so that they dontstand out completely so she took us up on the offer mark answered so back to how you think carlineux is planning to use allie what do you think hermione part in this is harry asked well carlineux is a woman of integrity she always looks at the big picture but she does like to have fun every so often so i guessing that you and hermione fit into her plan just as a side issue but was not part of the major plan mark replied well if she is bellatrix i assumed that she might have wanted revenge but still i dontcompletely understand why she had me pick between the two hermiones harry commented they asked you to do what mr and mrs granger exclaimed dontworry i really hermione hermione explained so what did she tell you about that harry asked turning towards hermione she kept on talking about trust and friendship she did seem quite calm about the whole thing though hermione said after a minute so maybe she was testing our friendship to see how strong it is harry replied that does sound like something she would do i thinking that they must have heard something about allie so they wanted her to join them mark added so may i ask a question mr granger piped in sure what would you like to know mark asked so how does allie reveal the secrets of the creation of magic mr granger asked oh that i not really sure mark answered sheepishly mark who are you talking to a female voice called out hi maggie i was just talking to the grangers and harry mark told her with a smile oh you must be telling them about allison right maggie asked yes but do you know how to retrieve the secret from allie mark asked her i heard my father talking about it and from what i can tell nobody is exactly sure yet but allie doesntknow that she has this secret herself the consensus is that the key to the revelation has to do with trust maggie replied trust hermione asked now i dontknow the details but that would explain why they are treating allie like their own and they are including her in their plans maggie added hm so do you think she is safe there hermione asked i think she is for the time being i think that the best course of action right now is to continue on and try to get through to allie mark suggested how do i do that she seems to completely hate me with a passion and we re not even sure that we re going to see her anytime soon hermione told them i sure that she will be back mark told them how do you know that harry asked because they arentfinished with her yet mark answered simply hermione looked down at the clock and took a double glance and grabbed harry by the arm what is it harry asked we need to get back did you even notice the time hermione asked gesturing to the clock harry looked and saw that it was already the evening they had been there for the entire afternoon mark maggie we have to get going but is there a way to contact you if we have any other questions hermione asked just look us up on your computer mark told her and gave her a quick wave and the screen turned off but hermione said as she stared at the blank screen thanks for tea mr and mrs granger but we have to get going harry told them as he shook his hand and gave mrs granger a hug i ll talk to you later hermione promised giving both of her parents a hug both harry and hermione rushed out and apparated back to the mansion and walked insidd to harry room so what do you think about everything hermione asked this whole thing is really unbelievable but at the same time our whole lives have been like that but at least we know that allie isntrelated by blood harry told her but she still is my sister but i do feel better knowing so much more i had no idea that there was so much to my family history but still am a little worried about allie carlineux seems like a much more dangerous person hermione commented that she is but that what makes her interesting harry told her with a glint in his eye i just dontknow what to do when i see her again hermione said sitting down just be you harry told her and that is hermione prodded be the wonderful caring individual that you always are and i know she will notice harry told her that easy for you to say but i not sure that i can do it hermione confessed well one way of doing that would be to not mention that you guys are sisters and try being friends first harry offered you re right about that so do you think that i can get through to her hermione asked if anybody can do it it you harry told her confidently hermione laughed and gave him a hug thanks for having confidence in me you always do know what to say to make me feel better hermione told her with a smile i do what i can harry replied back with a smile that she knew too well harry what are you planning hermione asked what do you mean harry asked innocently you have that look in your eye and when you get that look it never good hermione replied i resent that i have good ideas sometimes harry retorted sometimes but most of the time their idiotic like this one you are not going back there hermione told him firmly back where harry asked you know where it too dangerous and it not the right time hermione told him i have no idea what you are talking about harry replied back faking a yawn harry promise me you re not going back there we need to be patient and we need to have a plan before we do anything hermione asked offering her pinky i promise harry told her but avoiding the pinky harry hermione said again harry sighed and they hooked pinkies and she smiled good and remember what you told me hermione told him harry smile as she left the room and he paced about he was feeling extremely energetic and didntwant to stand still he wanted to do something to help hermione he really wanted to go back there and see what carlineux was up to but he couldntbecause he promised hermione and there was the fact that she would probably keep an eye out for him which means he doesnthave much of a chance of leaving easily he decided then to wait until the next day to come up with a new plan the next morning hermione woke up early and headed off to the kitchen to make some breakfast she didntsleep very well because she was really nervous about everything that she has learned the night before good morning allie told her brightly a n here is the next update you guys i know that it been awhile and i was planning to update earlier but with the holidays and everything i just got too busy i really hope you ll enjoy this chapter as i have enjoyed writing this one this one is mainly about h hr i thought it was time to have one of those chapters please review and let me know what you think disclaimer i dontown anything jk rowling owns harry and hermione and abc owns the bachelor this fic is for entertainment purposes only author heaven85 chapter 29 you re so lucky hermione christine told her i guess that i just have good luck hermione told her with a smile have a great time allie told her and gave her a hug hermione was pleasantly surprised and said thanks allie tell us all about it when you get back christine told her hermione nodded and headed outside to where harry was waiting hey harry said as he stood outside with an impish smile on his face hi hermione replied with a grin and a feeling of nervousness in the pit of her stomach are you ready to go harry asked as he offered her his hand sure so where are you taking me hermione asked as that feeling of nervousness left her the sooner we leave the sooner we ll know harry replied are you trying to be mysterious hermione inquired i not trying at all i really am this mysterious harry replied hermione just laughed and walked into the limousine harry grinned as he loved listening to her laugh so actually i wanted to ask you something hermione started you mean about chloe harry replied i think i heard you calling her alex what that about hermione asked i knew you were going to ask about that well that her real name harry answered and hermione asked well as it turns out alex actually contacted this company to help her in doing something harry explained what did she contact the company for hermione asked she contacted the company because she wanted their assistance in finding someone harry commented who did she want to find and why hermione asked the person that she wanted to find is chloe and the reason for this at this time isntexactly confirmed but from our investigations we figure that the two of them have issues to sort out harry added and i get the feeling that this company has something to do with carlineux hermione asked yes you re absolutely correct what gave that away harry teased her well maybe the fact that alex looked exactly like chloe unless they were identical twins it wouldntbe very likely hermione replied well you re right they arentidentical twins they do good work harry commented and well i was wondering if alex knows about magic hermione asked no as for as alex knows they are just muggles who are just really good at disguise work harry replied but wait then if that alex then where chloe hermione asked just relax she absolutely fine and safe where she is right now harry replied so you guys found her hermione asked yes we did and she doesntremember a thing that has happened harry told her you guys modified her memory hermione asked actually we didntneed to do anything she was already like that when we found her i guessing that she must have found out something that she shouldnthave we checked and she seems absolutely fine harry explained well as long as she fine hermione replied now let just forget about all that tonight and have some fun harry said you re right we really should i dontwant to think about this anymore so now can you let me know where we re going hermione asked looking around well i would but i really want this do be a surprise it wasntthe easiest thing to plan harry answered really you re actually taking the time to think about the place hermione asked yeah i wouldntwant to take you somewhere that you wouldntlike to go and let me tell you that it took me awhile to come up with a few possible locations harry added and what did you end up picking hermione asked curiosity why dontyou take a look out your window harry asked hermione took one look at harry and then turned her head to look out the window harry watched her face slowly light up and the smile on her face grow do you approve harry asked it beautiful harry i have always wanted to go on the water hermione replied with a smile wait until you see the yacht harry told her what do you have in store for me hermione asked raising her eyebrows you ll find out soon enough harry replied hermione smiled and followed harry out of the limousine where he took a handkerchief out of his pocket you re going to blindfold me hermione asked yes it ll keep the suspense up harry told her as he wrapped the handkerchief around her eyes and took her hand and led her very carefully out to where the dock was the air here smells fantastic hermione commented it really does okay so now you can take your blind fold off harry instructed hermione nodded and reached for her blindfold and took it off and opening her eyes to the beautiful yacht that lay in front of her the yacht was sleek and shiny and there was a painted stripe at the bow of the ship and in the ship there were a few windows and a table covered in a fancy table cloth and a place setting suitable for two there were also a couple of candles and flowers and placed them on the table it looks beautiful hermione told him with a smile shall we harry asked we shall hermione replied taking his hand and carefully entering the yacht and began looking around so what do you think harry said handing her a glass i think that you picked a good location what do you have planned for tonight hermione asked a relaxing and fun evening that i pretty sure that you ll enjoy harry answered that does sound good hermione replied so first we will have dinner harry replied leading her to the table and pulling the chair out for her thank you the table looks great hermione said sitting down noticing there laid a basket of bread and the lovely arrangement of flowers so is there anything in particular that you wanted tonight harry asked i sure that you whatever you picked will be fine hermione replied well then i ll bring out the appetizers harry added snapping his fingers i cantwait hermione commented in less than a minute two plates and glasses were placed in front of them by a waiter my name is shane and i will be your waiter for the evening if you would like anything feel free to ask right away here are your hors d oeuvres and would you like a glass of sherry shane asked sure i d love one hermione replied holding up her glass and it was quickly filled how about you sir shane asked harry i d love one as well harry replied with a nod shane then left quickly hermione took a quick bite of her canap and took a sip of her sherry so what do you think harry asked it a little bit spicy but it just the way that i like it why dontyou try it hermione replied harry took a quick bite of his canap and began coughing and grabbed for a glass of water hermione just burst out into giggles stop laughing harry protested so i canthelp it remember the time we went to madrid hermione asked yeah i do it was one of the few times that i didnthave to work as much harry responded yeah it was one of the few times when we could actually got to go to the same place hermione added i was actually quite surprised to see you there harry commented as was i but my favorite part of the trip was when we had dinner at the las bravas hermione replied i have no idea what you re talking about harry replied maybe i should refresh your memory then hermione replied with a smile you really donthave to harry added i really insist and really it no trouble at all you see my friend told me that if i was ever in madrid that i had to go to this place and try their specialty which was the patatas bravas which is fried potatoes with a spicy paprika sauce and you took one bite of the potato and you just went red and hermione said okay okay you dontneed to go into details harry spoke up quickly so i take it that you do remember hermione commented a little and didntyou promise not to bring it up again harry asked i promised that i would never bring it up in front of other people and it just the two of us hermione replied sweetly harry glared back at her and said i ll let that slide this time but honestly it really wasntall that funny i could have choked on something you did not choke on anything the pieces were not all that big and you were the one that was bragging about being able to eat anything and stuffed your face with it hermione reminded him okay maybe you have a point there harry muttered okay then what next hermione asked finishing up her plate and handing it to shane we ll be bringing the main course which is the duck a l orange shane replied that is one of my favorites hermione commented with a smile i know harry replied with a smile shane placed down the plate in front of both of them and went back inside hermione took a bite and smiled this is really good it tastes moist and the sauce is really good harry took a bite and said it does taste good so where is this food from hermione asked well have you heard le r ve harry asked i think i read something about that place and how you have to book at least three months in advance to get a table are you telling me that we re eating the food from over there hermione asked harry nodded with a smile but how did you manage that hermione asked well first of all i actually have a reservation for tonight and i was planning on surprising you and taking you there but then this came up so all i had to do was to call in a favor so that we could still keep the reservation harry explained really that really sweet of you but what the reason hermione asked do i need a special reason to take you out for dinner harry asked no you dontneed one but you usually do have one hermione added well i usually do but this time i just wanted to take you out for dinner because we ve both been so busy and haventspend as much time and then i while traveling i heard about this restaurant and thought that would be something that you would want to try harry explained well it was a great idea but i have one question how are we getting the food from the restaurant are we anywhere near the restaurant hermione asked curiously we arentbut being a wizard does have certain advantages harry answered it certainly can but what exactly did you do hermione inquired well i managed to set up a portkey near the restaurant so that we can have access to the restaurant harry added okay i following you but isntthat a bit risky muggles could see you hermione pointed yes i do know that but i have managed to call in a favor from a fellow auror over in san antonio and he been helping us get the food here harry added that sounds like a pretty solid plan but what did you tell shane the food was coming from hermione asked curiously well we just told him that the chef didntwant to be disturbed and that the food would be brought to him when they are ready to be served but just to be safe i have also placed a protection charm around the area so he wontgo anywhere near there harry replied okay but what about hermione started and just so you know i did get special permission to set up this portkey just for tonight harry answered okay i impressed how did you know i was going to ask that hermione asked because i know you and how you are a stickler for rules and it was obviously wouldntbe following protocol harry added hey i have to say that i have loosened up a lot over the years being friends with you and ron hermione protested well you have definitely changed from the first time that we met you at hogwarts harry responded with a smile you have not changed that much though overall hermione replied after a few moments i dontknow if i should be offended or not by that comment but thank you hermione replied with a laugh there you go again with that attitude of yours but just so you know i think that it great that you re both the same but different hermione replied how am i the same but different harry asked well first of all you still have that you have that hero complex and rushing ahead and doing things without thinking hermione answered that not necessarily true i never do things without at least a hunch now and sometimes in my line of work i cantplan ahead before doing everything harry replied amused well i wasntdone yet but you have matured a lot over the years and you have learned to be a bit more careful and you ve become an incredibly talented wizard hermione finished well i think that you turned out pretty well too you have a good sense of adventure now but still a little bit of a stickler for rules harry added with a slight flush only a tiny bit of adventure hermione asked raising her eyebrows okay so you do have a big sense of adventure if you wanted to you would have made a great auror but you chose not to you also have ignored rules if necessary to help others or in the sense of justice harry continued well sometimes there are more important things than rules hermione replied you really surprised us sometimes i remember when we first met you and how you were so worried about getting expelled and following all the rules harry replied fondly and you two were always wandering off and ignoring the rules but that not always a bad thing hermione commented and following the rules can have it rewards harry commented and because of you guys i didntspend all my time in the books and managed to have a lot of fun hermione added those were some great times werentthey harry added there were some really good times that i will never forget hermione added harry and hermione finished off their main dishes in comfortable silence so are you ready for dessert harry asked i full but i dontmind eating dessert hermione replied with a smile harry signaled for shane to bring the dessert out shane placed two plates in front of them what is this hermione asked it is white chocolate bread pudding shane answered and quickly left i have never had this dessert before hermione stated taking a small spoonful then you d better try it harry added taking a spoonful as well hm this is heavenly it nice and warm and very rich hermione commented it tastes sweet and warm and this would definitely be one of my favorite desserts harry added i feel really full hermione said putting down her spoon and sat back down in her chair how was everything shane asked taking her plate everything was really delicious hermione told her with a smile how about you shane asked turning to harry excellent the food was delicious and served warm and fresh harry answered so what else do you have planned hermione asked the night is just beginning would you like to dance harry asked offering his hand hermione took it with a smile and got up and noticed a couple of violinists starting to play a soft melody and harry led her in a waltz you re becoming quite the talented dancer hermione replied i ve had quite a few years experience now and i am glad that i learned this while i was younger harry answered i remember when you first learned the waltz during our 4th year for the yule ball hermione asked the yule ball i so nervous and worried that i would make a fool of myself in front of all those people harry replied although you werentthe best or the most elegant dancer you pulled off looking like a natural hermione told him and the yule ball was the first time i ever saw you really dressed up you were the most beautiful girl there harry told her softly harry thank you but i know that it not true hermione answered blushing slightly no you really were fleur is beautiful but she is also part veela so of course she is beautiful but you hermione really took my breath away that night harry explained well i did spend a lot of time getting ready for the ball hermione commented and it did pay off you were the belle of the ball both inside and out harry added thank you it means a lot to hear you say that hermione told him softly and over the years you ve grown even more beautiful harry complimented thank you and you re not bad yourself hermione told him harry smiled and pulled her closer and signaled for a change in music and led her into the quickstep he began to step forward with is left foot while hermione stepped back with the right foot he then took a step forward with the right foot and then touched the left foot next to the right foot hermione followed by taking a step back with the left food and touching the right foot next to the left foot then they both took a side step and brought their foot back he then led her into the natural turn and then executed a quarter turn progressive chasse and lock combo where did you learn to do this hermione asked surprised it was one of the many skills that i have acquired during some of my training sessions harry explained well you certainly are full of surprises hermione commented and i still have some up my sleeve would you like to follow me harry asked hermione nodded and followed harry as he walked on over and stopped in front of a room with a special wooden design on it so what behind this door hermione asked why dontyou open it and see harry asked hermione turned towards harry and gave him a quizzical look and reached for the door and pushed it open and when she opened to door she saw a beautiful scene in front of her she saw an old styled building with a dome shaped roof with tons of light that reflected along the river it was a beautiful sight harry is this where i think it is hermione asked in deep awe of her surroundings if you re talking about prague bohemia czech republic then you re right i remember you telling me about how you would like to go and see some of the sights but you ve never had the time to do so harry told her with a smile it nice to know you were listening the view from the vltava river is amazing that is the illuminated prague castle is amazingly beautiful it the number place that i wanted to see in prague hermione told him i know but the pictures dontremarkably do the place justice do you want to take a closer look harry asked of course i would hermione asked then go on ahead i have made arrangement harry told her with a smile harry this is incredible and beautiful but are you sure that this is okay hermione asked dontworry hermione i ve taken care of everything all i want you to do is relax and enjoy the scenery harry told her as he offered his hand hermione took it with a smile and together they walked out the door to where a boat was waiting you really have thought of everything hermione commented as she noticed the rose and a bucket with champagne in the boat well i try harry replied helping her carefully into the boat they sat in the boat and in comfortable silence and admired the beautiful sights in front of them harry turned towards hermione as he heard her sneeze are you cold harry asked as noticed hermione shivering slightly a little bit i forget to bring my jacket hermione replied slightly embarrassed harry took off his jacket and placed it on her shoulders thank you but what about you hermione asked dontworry about me i not cold at all harry replied flexing his biceps okay then if you re sure hermione replied with a laugh so what is that building there harry asked changing the subject oh that is the national theatre hermione started to explain harry handed her a glass of champagne and looked at the beautiful scenery in front of them and took a glance back towards hermione and smiled as he took in her hair waving in the wind and watching her smile as she took in everything and how her eyes light up when she is talking about things that interested her what is it do i have something on my face hermione asked as he noticed him staring i just love how animated you get when you re talking about something that really interests you harry answered hermione suddenly crushed harry into a big hug harry was surprised but pulled her closer thank you harry for taking me here and showing me this it an experience that i never want to forget and i so happy to be sharing it with you you dontknow how much this means to me hermione whispered i think i do harry replied back hermione looked around and asked can we stop the boat and stay here for a little while this view is breathtakingly beautiful not as beautiful as you harry added softly suddenly the boat stopped and caused hermione to fall on top of harry when she moved their foreheads touched and their eyes met and in that moment harry didntthink and just reacted and leaned in and he kissed her softly and sweetly hermione was surprised as first but with just a moment hesitation and kissed him back harry kissed her back and pulled her closer to him hermione moved her arms tighter around harry and returned his kisses equally in passion they continued like until the need for air caused them to break apart they both looked up and just stared at each other and harry leaned in once again but this time they were interrupted by the ringing of his cell phone hello harry said into the phone it time to head back a familiar voice said into the phone mike is it that time already harry asked surprised really i guessing you didntnotice the time mike answered with a laugh no i really didn t is there anyway we can stay longer harry replied sheepishly i sorry i would love to help you but we cantpull anymore strings tonight mike told him apologetically thanks for the call harry replied with a sigh no problem i ll talk to you later mike said what is it hermione asked it time that we headed back i wish we could stay longer but harry told her apologetically it okay harry tonight was enough plus we can always come back right hermione asked that is very true harry replied with a grin as he reached for an object that appeared to him and a door appeared in front of them once again they opened to door to see the familiar surroundings of their yacht they walked back out of the room and noticed that they had now reached the shore where the limo was waiting for them once again they both looked back out at the yacht with bright smiles before they headed back into the limo which took hermione back to the mansion during the trip back to the mansion they both sat comfortably both in their own worlds stealing glances at one another harry got out and walked her to the mansion and said so i hope the date turned out well it was incredible more than i possibly imagined it was perfect hermione replied and quickly kissed him before heading back inside it really was perfect harry murmured to himself with a smile a n i so sorry i

smile on her face memories of the beautiful night that she had spent with harry flooded her mind last night was truly beautiful and very magical in more than one sense of the word it was a night that

you seem a lot closer than before christine replied we do hermione asked yeah you do i mean i always thought that you didntlike her all that much and it was pretty much a consensus that we all thought that she was a little bit on the weird side christine added well i did at first but i think that we may have judged her before really getting to know her and i have since then i think that she actually is a very nice girl and actually she is quite sweet if you get to know her hermione explained i dontreally know about that she seems quite a bit stand offish and doesntseem like she actually wants to get to know the rest of us christine replied she may seem like that at first but she really great once you get to know her you should try and you ll see what i mean hermione added well if you really think so christine answered after a few moments i really think that you should hermione told her with a nod just then allie entered the room once again and grabbed something and put it in her pocket and said i forgot i left my list downstairs i ll see you later then hermione asked let meet at the ritual supper club at 11 45am christine asked sure i ll let allie know hermione answered christine nodded gave a little wave as hermione left and headed back upstairs and knocked quickly on allie door allie opened the door and smiled and asked what do you want to tell me we re meeting at

just wanted to say thanks allie explained you re welcome then i ll see you in a few hours then hermione told her i ll see you then allie told her hermione gave a quick wave and headed back into her room and grabbed a brush and ran it through her hair and put on a bit of light makeup then she looked through her closet to find something fitting to wear for the fashion show because she didntwant to look too under dressed for the event she eventually settled on a light and dark checkered knee length dress that had a flared look with short sleeves and a scooped neck line as she turned around she heard a light knocking on her door and she opened it up quickly and saw a familiar face she quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him inside what do you think you re doing hermione said in a scolding tone you look incredible harry said thank you hermione replied with a blush so where are you going harry inquired well i heading over to a fashion show with christine and allie hermione answered that fashion show harry asked raising his eyebrows yes that fashion show dontlook so surprised hermione replied just doesntseem like your kind of thing harry replied so stop evading my question what are

what if somebody decided to come upstairs hermione added well nobody did did they harry asked well you re lucky that nobody saw so dontyou do it again hermione scolded again well then i ll be going

should leave hermione added with a slight smirk so wait you re saying that you want me to stay harry asked hermione just shook her head and grabbed him by his shirt collar and pulled him away from the door harry was about to say something but decided against it as he saw the glare that hermione was giving him so now that you finally decided to be serious why are you really here hermione asked again always so anxious to get right to the point i wanted to give this to you harry told her and pulled something out of his pocket what is it hermione asked why dontyou take a look harry added offering her his hand hermione gave him a surprised look and took the pieces of paper from his hand and took a quick look are these the symphony tickets hermione asked in deep surprise harry just nodded with a huge smile how did you get them how did you know hermione asked him first of all you have been talking about the concert for weeks and i just asked a friend of mine of they could get me tickets and they came through harry answered hermione pulled him into a long hug whispering thank you about three times you re very welcome harry murmured into her hair now is there anything i can do for you hermione asked after pulling back you donthave to do anything your smile and appreciation is enough for me harry commented that sweet but are you sure there isntanything that i can do for you hermione

back shoving him again so was i harry responded i giving you one last chance to take it back hermione replied with a grin and what if i don t harry asked hermione just smiled said would you mind picking up my watch over there harry nodded and bent down to pick up the watch hermione took this split second and jumped onto his back and smacked him in the head ouch what are you doing harry asked teaching you a lesson hermione answered sweetly i see you re punishing me by making me carry you i guess you re a bit heavy harry said earning another slap in the head hermione pulled on his ear and said say that again i mean you re not heavy at all in fact you are really light harry said and dontyou have something else to say hermione prodded and i sorry that you dontrealize that you nag a lot

it not my fault that you re ticklish hermione added and you re not harry asked i not hermione answered turning to walk away we ll see about that harry said with a grin and starting tickling her from behind hermione held her breath to keep herself from laughing you want to laugh dontyou harry said hermione shook her head harry just tickled her harder and watched her face with a smile he could tell that she wasntgoing to be able to keep it in much longer just then there was a knock on the door followed by a voice hermione are you in there harry and hermione looked at each other and then around the room just a minute hermione called out and grabbed harry and pushed him into the closet and shut the door hermione took a quick look in the mirror and saw that her hair and clothes were a bit messed up and quickly tried to fix them both up and opened the door sorry about that hermione said opening the door so was i interrupting anything allie asked interrupting anything why would you ask that hermione asked i thought that i heard some laughter coming from your room allie replied oh yeah i was laughing because my friend was just telling me a funny story on the phone so what do you want to ask me hermione asked i was just going to go to the fashion show now allie inquired i thought that show didntstart until noon hermione asked the show doesntstart until noon but i have special passes so we can go backstage do you want to come allie asked sure but where did you get them hermione asked curiously actually carlineux called me to tell me about it isntshe great allie asked yea she is hermione replied with a smile so are you coming allie asked sure i would love to go hermione replied just let me grab my bag and we can get going allie said heading out the door hermione followed after grabbing her bag a few moments later harry came out of the closet and answered his phone potter speaking harry said quickly we heard from a reliable source that some activity will be happening at the supper club agent red replied i ll on my way harry replied in a serious tone disclaimer i dontown anything this is for entertainment purposes only a n sorry for the long time for an update i hope you guys like it thank you too all my loyal readers thank so much for all of your reviews chapter 8 the next morning hermione got up feeling pretty happy about her date last night it had felt really great to be able to conquer her fear of heights it was something she would like to do again sometime later on with harry she had decided last night that she would spend most of her day before the rose ceremony to find out more about allie she wanted to know as much as she could about her before making her final decision of what she was like her gut had told her many times that there was something strange or mysterious about her and she was determined to get to the bottom of it first thing she had to do was to find as much information out about allie as she could it was a good thing that she had brought her computer with her but first she needed to find out approximately where she lived and her full name she knew she could get that information from the producers but it would be a little bit risky to do that she wanted to see what some of the other girls knew about her she would have to ask around but she couldntseem too nosy or the others could get suspicious she got up quickly and decided to take a walk outside for some fresh air as she walked outside she smiled as she took in the beautiful sky and fresh air it felt good to be outside and helped her relax just a little bit she took a quick turn around the grounds before heading back to the house she then heard someone call her name she turned around and saw the person she wanted to see the least she put on a bright smile and said good morning allie it is a lovely morning for a jog isntit allie replied in a cheerful tone i agree do you jog every morning back home hermione inquired innocently back in wisconsin i would try to jog at least three times a week but i lived in a small town so there wasntmuch to see allie answered back hermione nodded and proceeded to continue walking you lived in london right allie asked yes i spent time there hermione replied anything interesting happen while you were there allie asked what do you mean hermione asked did anything unexplained or out of the ordinary happen to you allie replied after a thought nothing out of the ordinary i never did have good luck hermione answered quickly are you sure allie pressed yes i sure hermione said firmly quickly looking away see you back at the house then allie called as she jogged away i certainly hope not i cantcheck up on you with you looking over my shoulder at least i know where to start checking hermione thought to herself she got back to the house about 10 minutes later morning chloe greeted her morning hermione greeted back with a grin want some juice christine asked holding up a glass sure hermione replied with a smile how was your jog jennifer asked it was nice did allie mention it hermione asked yeah chloe confirmed some of us are heading out for a swim you guys want to join us lisa asked we ll be there chloe and jennifer replied christine nodded but hermione said i not in a mood for a swim okay if you change your mind we ll be right outside lisa answered as most of the woman went upstairs to change hermione went upstairs to grab her portable computer to do some research she looked around to make sure that nobody else was around before she entered her search she was looking for any person named allie renshaw in the wisconsin area over the next couple of hours she began her search she got quite a few hits on the last name renshaw however there were only a few of them named allie she found a few allies to find out about what areas they lived in she then restricted her search to these areas to see what kind of information she could find on the allie that lived there so far she couldntfind much information on any of the allie renshaws in the area she then decided to go on these alumni websites to ask if other people knew any allie renshaws she was able to locate one of the allie listed and found out that she was definitely not the allie she was looking for hermione then put down the screen of her computer and hid it away quickly as she went to the bathroom a couple of minutes later she heard lisa and lucy head back inside chloe jennifer christine sue and allie soon followed suit you should have joined us hermione it was fun allie said to her maybe next time hermione replied with a slight smile harry was pacing around his dining room as she thought about having to eliminate three more girls tonight it was always a hard decision and he knew that he would have to make the right choices it was hard as usual to eliminate any of them all of the women were interesting smart and beautiful there were a few ladies that he had an incredibly amazing time with as well his thoughts then turned toward hermione even if she wasnthis best friend he still believed that he wouldnthave eliminated her from the competition now the hard part began he wanted to think very carefully before making his choice so that he wouldntbe making any mistakes by eliminating the wrong women a few hours later she heard a tiny beeping noise and she went to look at her computer and saw that she had received a reply back they said that they had a couple of classes with her but didntknow her too well she seemed very quiet and didnttalk to many people however she had only transferred to the school recently so she didntknow if she had always been that way in another reply she received back they had mentioned that they didntknow of her specifically but had heard that she was a great person who enjoyed volunteering at soup kitchens the kennels and the old folks home ever since a few years ago he hadntreally taken any notice of her being around before hermione took a deep breath as she thought about the information that she had received she didntlearn much about her besides how great a person she was maybe it was time to do some more intense checking up on her she could ask a friend of hers to check in the police database to see if she had any skeletons in her closet after making up her mind to do that she instantly felt better and then decided to venture back downstairs to see what the other women were up to harry was making his final decisions on who he was going to eliminate tonight a few minutes before the ceremony was going to take place a few moments later the knock on the door told him that it was time for him to go to the mansion for the rose ceremony once he arrived there he headed straight outside to where the ceremony to take place and he watched all the women to assemble into their positions he knew that they were all nervous but they all had smiles pasted on their faces matthew once again gave his speech before the ceremony and lead harry over to the table of roses that he would hand out the women that remain harry grabbed the first rose and called out the first name christine he called and then said will you accept this rose yes christine smiled and gave him a kiss on his cheek chloe he called next and then continued in this fashion until he reached his second last rose hermione he called with a grin looking at her nervous expression and the said will you accept this rose i would love to hermione replied with a smile and a kiss on the cheek for his final rose he called out allie will you accept this rose yes allie replied with a grin and gave him a kiss on the cheek those of you who did not receive a rose please take your time to say your good byes matthew said isabelle walked up first and said to harry it just wasntworking out was it i sorry i really had a great time getting to know you but harry started but you dont think that i the one for you isabelle finished looking said yeah harry answered i hope that you find her here isabelle replied with a forced smile and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and walked away quickly she then quickly looked back at the remaining women and she swore she saw allie smirking at her but it was gone in a flash and in its place was a sad smile the rest of the women left quickly after giving hugs to a few of the girls they all left until only allie hermione lisa chloe jennifer sue christine callie and stephanie remained they each grabbed a cup of champagne and toasted with harry to celebrate that they were still there the next day all the women remaining were quite happy to see that isabelle was gone and everybody was in a good mood especially stephanie she had the brightest smile on her face when hermione woke up she could hear the happy chatter coming from downstairs she took this opportunity to call her friend who had some contacts in the police force she was asking her to do a background check on allie for her then she went downstairs to join the others hello allie greeted her cheerfully good morning hermione greeted back it is isntit stephanie asked happily she been like that all morning chloe told her hermione just smiled in response the mood of the house is certainly lighter since isabelle left lisa commented the rest of the girls just nodded hermione quickly grabbed some breakfast and some juice they were all chatting away happily a few minutes later sue came in carrying a note so who it for callie asked its addressed to you hermione stephanie lisa and jennifer sue replied with a smile stephanie grabbed the card and read out loud dear callie hermione stephanie lisa and jennifer i hope you ve had a good night rest because you re going to need your strength today i ll be here later this afternoon to pick you guys up be prepared for some messy fun i looking forward to seeing all of you this afternoon harry messy fun jennifer asked sounds very intriguing callie commented i bet it has to do with paint stephanie answered well that will be fun but i guess we shouldntdress too fancy then jennifer replied definitely i wouldntwant to have to get pain off my clothes they re like dry clean only stephanie replied while quickly heading upstairs i sure not all your clothes are dry clean only lisa added while rolling her eyes you excited hermione asked callie and jennifer yeah it going to be really fun and now that there are only the 4 of us we ll each get to spend more time with harry callie added awesome jennifer commented it would be nice to spend some one on one time with harry hermione thought to herself with a smile harry stood outside of the mansion quietly thinking to himself he was quite excited to see what hermione thought of this date idea and couldnthelp but laugh at the thought of hermione covered in paint hermione would definitely be a fierce competitor and he couldntwait to see how the others would fare on this date harry knew that callie would probably do well because of her job and aspirations he was definitley hoping that it would be an interesting afternoon harry walked up to the door and ran the doorbell in a few moments the door opened and he saw hermione standing there with a large grin on her face and her hair up in a cute ponytail what are you so happy about he inquired i ve had a good morning hermione replied with an amused smile so it doesnthave anything to do with me huh he answered kind of sadly of course it does seeing you always brightens up my day i mean you know it always good to see a friend she answered quickly i glad to see you too harry said with a dazzling grin and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek hermione just blushed harry was about to comment as he saw the rest of the women coming down the stairs they were all dressed casually and looked quite lovely you ladies ready to go harry asked i always ready stephanie replied with a smile all right then let get going harry replied opening the door and leading them out to the car so where are heading off to callie inquired we re going to play paintball harry answered i love paintball callie exclaimed happily i was hoping someone would harry answered back with a grin i ve heard of it but i ve never actually played it before stephanie added my friends told me that it was really fun lisa added quickly me either jennifer said while hermione nodded great harry said as they arrived at the field some staff members came out and explained the basics to them so how do you guys want to do this teams or each separately callie asked teams one more experienced player per team i ll be on harry team stephanie called out what about you guys callie asked jennifer and hermione teams are fine with me hermione replied with a smile yeah i agree lisa answered with a smile i ll be on callie team hermione called with an evil gleam in her eye so you re going against me arentyou harry asked hermione raising her eyebrow i guess so hermione replied with a slight smile be prepared to lose harry whispered to her we ll see about that mr potter hermione whispered seductively in his ear harry was shocked for a second before regaining his composure and then grabbed hermione slightly as she was walking away and said not so fast were you trying to seduce me that depends did you want me to hermione teased back two can play this game harry thought to himself and said what if i said i did hermione was a little surprised at his response but smiled and replied how about we play a little game what kind of game he inquired we make this competition a little more interesting she replied with a smile okay what are the terms harry asked with intrigue before hermione could answer stephanie had come up and grabbed harry arm and said come on they re ready for you thanks he said with a slight smile as he headed back towards the group stephanie waited for a little bit and then turned to hermione and asked in an angry tone what was that what was what hermione inquired curiously dontplay dumb with me what were you doing with harry just now stephanie asked again we were having a private conversation hermione answered evenly who do you think you are stephanie demanded what is that supposed to mean hermione asked with anger in her voice i mean what gives you the right to steal him away from the rest of us so that you can have alone time with harry stephanie retorted like you havent done that before i ve seen you try to do that many times hermione answered back sharply it is part of the show besides i ve only done that a couple of times because you seemed to have dragged him away again stephanie replied so it part of the show for you but with me it is wrong hermione replied sharply well i just doing what everyone else wants to do but are too nice to do stephanie added like i going to believe that i didntdo anything dontblame me just because harry doesntlike spending time with you hermione answered while rolling her eyes and proceeded to walk away stephanie caught her elbow and spoke in a threatening tone i only going to say this once so you better listen stop monopolizing harry time or else or else what hermione asked i ll just say you ll be sorry but you doesntreally matter as long as you heed my warning stephanie replied and walked back towards the others hermione just shook her head as she walked back slowly towards the group she wondered what she was going to do on one hand she shouldntreally worry too much about being kicked off the show because she is the spy and the producers knew that but she still decided that she would have to be more careful around her from now on so are both teams made up harry asked looking at hermione hermione and the other girls nodded hermione callie and lisa formed one team harry stephanie and jennifer formed the other team harry continued and said we re playing the flag version of the game the goal of this game is to capture the other team flag and return to our base while protecting our own flag one way of protecting the flag is to get the other team members out by shooting paint balls at them now if one of your team members accidentally shoot at you you are still out so we are out if we get hit by a paint ball hermione asked yes now if get splattered by paint hitting a tree then you are not considered out harry added hermione nodded and they lined up to get their guns with the paintballs goggles as well as something to wear over their clothes so they dontget their clothes completely dirty remember it is important to wear your goggles and mask at all times harry called out how long are we playing for callie asked the game will last for about 30 minutes harry replied oh just so everybody knows you ll not supposed to shoot if you re within 5 ft of a person callie added oh there will be other people to join our teams it makes it more fun harry said after a thought the guns were not too heavy but still a little awkward to hold is this the right way to hold this lisa asked harry harry walked on over and carefully observed her hand position and quickly demonstrated the more correct way of holding the gun with his own gun thanks lisa replied with a smile what about me stephanie asked harry walked past hermione and gave her a smile as hermione returned the smile as she rolled her eyes over to stephanie stephanie was holding the gun completely inaccurately no no donthold it like that that would be dangerous harry told her and demonstrated on his gun but stephanie tried to hold it like harry showed her but for some reason she seemed to be unable to do it accurately so harry walked closer to her and moved her hands into the correct positions i not usually like this but i ve never been really comfortable with guns stephanie whispered with an embarrassed smile harry smiled and whispered back dontworry about it it not a bad thing to be uncomfortable with guns jennifer had walked over to hermione and asked is this how to hold it hermione looked at her hands and nodded good i was a little worried just look at her she is just acting dumb so that he would come and help her out jennifer added nervous as she nodded her head towards stephanie and harry i sure harry realizes that hermione answered looking down i sure hope so jennifer replied harry walked towards them with a smile and asked are you guys ready as ready as i ll ever be callie answered then they separated out into their teams and each team was given time to walk to their home bases on opposite sides of the field it was woody with many trees that allowed them to hide two other people joined their team one of them was named phil and the other named susan diana and kelly joined harry team so what is our strategy callie asked i say we knock out stephanie first lisa replied quickly i agree with that hermione commented with a smile okay then that settled but who should try and get the flag callie asked how about you i mean since you have played this game before lisa suggested okay so then i guess you two will try to keep the others away from me in the meantime callie answered lisa and hermione smiled and replied okay susan said i ll stay and guard the flag callie replied sure phil why dontyou come with us what the game plan harry inquired i say we try and knock out the strongest player which i would think to be callie stephanie suggested sure jennifer replied okay then its settled then harry replied well on person should stay and guard the flag stephanie told jennifer jennifer rolled her eye and walked away toward the flag what are we going to do stephanie explained capture the opponents flag harry answered with a smile phil callie lisa and hermione were quietly walking around searching for any sign of stephanie as they were walking lisa asked hermione so where did you disappear to what hermione responded for awhile when we were getting ready to play you and harry were no where to be seen you should have seen stephanie she looked steamed lisa answered she was steamed callie added i was just talking with harry he had walked on over to ask me a question hermione answered quickly just talking lisa asked yes just talking it was going nicely until stephanie showed up hermione answered what did she say callie asked let just say that she wasntbeing pleasant hermione replied stephanie is just so ugh she is being a big pain in the butt and she really does have no right at all to be mad at you lisa responded let get her callie replied with a smile no arguments here why dontyou go on up ahead to get the flag and we ll be watching here for the others hermione suggested callie and lisa nodded and callie headed off harry was looking around for any sign of callie hermione or lisa he then notices some movement behind the trees he waited for a little bit and then noticed that susan was near by he needed to get her out or at least distract her to get the flag he made his way slowly back to stephanie and said okay i going to distract her and when you notice that the coast is clear go and get the flag okay okay stephanie nodded nervously dontworry i ll watch your back kelly reassured her harry took a deep breath and made a break for it running very fast past susan and then ducking behind some trees susan quickly aimed her gun at harry and shot but missed and hit a tree instead she quickly followed him but lost him and quickly raced back to where the flag was she saw stephanie walking away from the tree and aimed her gun to fire at her and missed her by a millimeter stephanie took this time to hide behind some mound of dirt susan heard a gun fire and quickly ducked and the shot missed her she quickly hid behind some trees and finally saw some movement behind some trees she waited until she could see some part of the body and shot and it hit kelly kelly got up and called out and held the gun over her head and walked off of the field susan then proceeded off to find the rest of her team during this time harry had returned and made his way back to stephanie harry quietly motioned to tell stephanie there was some movement near the trees stephanie nodded but was getting somewhat restless and was going to move towards another tree it was then that harry saw kelly pointing her gun towards stephanie and he then called out for her to duck and the paintballs just barely missed her and hit the trees run harry called and she complied quickly and ran behind another group of bushes harry was soon next to her this is such a good experience for me stephanie told him how harry asked it ll be a good angle for writing my stories and this is good for the heart stephanie explained i glad okay so why dontwe separate now and you go over there harry asked pointing in that direction but i sure that what they want us to do stephanie pointed out yeah maybe but it better than both of us getting shot isntit and i ll be watching you harry asked stephanie nodded reluctantly and proceeded to walk on ahead he then told diana i want you to stay here and watch for the other team to return callie was hiding behind some trees and looking around to see if anyone was guarding the flag and noticed someone watching the flag after awhile she saw the face it was jennifer who was guarding the flag she motioned for hermione phil and lisa to join her jennifer is guarding the flag do you guys think you guys could distract her for a bit while i go and get the flag callie asked no problem hermione replied hermione phil and lisa sat behind some trees while aiming their guns at where jennifer was last seen they were going to shoot if they saw any sign of movement from jennifer callie very slowly proceeded towards the flag she was laying low so that she would not be seen jennifer was watching very closely and thought that she saw slight movement on the floor and quickly aimed her gun getting ready to fire once she was sure that there was someone there she pressed her finger to the trigger and felt a pellet of paint hit her arm she called out and she then held the gun over her head and walked off the field rubbing her arm to deal with the slight pain callie grabbed the flag and returned back to join hermione and phil a couple of us should stay here just incase they have got our flag phil responded okay then why dont you and hermione stay here and wait lisa suggested hermione and phil nodded so let head back to our home base callie said with a smile stephanie and harry and walking back to their home base hiding every once in a while behind a tree they were cautious not to lose the flag stephanie was walking slowly up ahead towards their base harry thought he heard some movement behind him and signaled for stephanie to continue on towards their base harry waited quietly behind some dirt as he saw susan walking past him and he aimed his gun and shot at her he missed because she had ducked behind a tree susan was then looking in the direction of the gun shot getting ready to fire her gun when she saw harry she aimed at harry and missed him harry fired back missing at first but then hit susan on the shoulder as she tried to shoot back susan got up called out and held the gun over her head she then walked off the field harry then got up to return to his home base callie and lisa were were reaching their home base with the flag they hid behind some trees to observe their surroundings and noticed that their flag was gone well let hope that hermione and phil can get our flag back callie told lisa back at the harry team home base hermione and phil stood at different positions waiting patiently for any sign of the other team returning a few moments later hermione saw stephanie carrying a flag she was looking around carefully and quickly ducked behind some rocks come on stephanie come on out to where we can see you hermione said stephanie was looking around and didntnotice anyone around so she walked out from behind the tree and she narrowly missed being hit by a paintball she looked around trying to see her shooter but she couldntsee anyone she was getting nervous and then she saw another paintball narrowly miss her and hitting a tree from another direction hermione walked closer to her and stood close to a tree and said surrender stephanie no i won t stephanie responded with more confidence then she felt and aimed her gun to shoot hermione but didntget a chance as she was hit with a paintball from behind her that wasntreally fair stephanie answered dead people arent allowed to talk hermione replied stephanie looked angry and was about to say something but decided against it stalked off the field hermione picked up the flag and smiled at phil thanks for the cover no problem phil responded with a smile why dontyou head back to our home base i ll be there in a little bit hermione told him sure phil asked yeah i can protect myself hermione assured him harry had headed back and saw someone already there he then smiled as he realized who it was so it just you and me huh hermione i guess it is hermione responded with a slight smile you know i going to have to get that flag from you he said with a slight grin and amused tone i know but you know that i cantgive it to you she responded back in the same tone so what are the stakes she asked how about if i win you ll clean my room for a month he suggested no let make it more interesting hermione replied if i win you have to go to that dinner with that annoying contributor of yours he suggested with a sly grin no way i ve been avoiding her for the past 4 months you wouldntdo that to me i mean you ve met her right she asked hey you wanted to make it more interesting harry added fine what about if i win hermione inquired if you win i ll do that interview for that magazine with rita skeeter he answered easily no you were going to have to do that interview eventually no it needs to be a little more interesting she interjected fine what do you suggest harry asked if i win then you have to shave your head leaving a patch of hair on your head hermione responded i dontthink that the producers would appreciate that very much he answered with a slight grin well i wouldntask you to do it right now you could do it after the show and i think you would look cute she replied in that case that still wouldntwork remember that i dontwant to draw attention to myself harry reminded her i got it then for one night we will go out and you will say anything i tell you to hermione said after a moment brightly anything he inquired yep anything are you worried she answered in a teasing tone no but fine harry reluctantly agreed great hermione replied cheerfully just then he heard the sound of someone heading towards them harry turned around and hermione took this opportunity to hide harry saw phil quickly hide behind some bushes he turned back around and saw that hermione was gone he just shook his head with a smile and ran towards a portion of dirt to survey his surroundings at first he saw phil from behind some trees and harry aimed his gun and fired he had a direct hit and then phil was out he waited for that familiar head of brown hair to pass by and he wasntdisappointed he saw hermione run in the direction towards her home base he smiled and headed off in the same direction callie and lisa had been waiting patiently in two separate locations callie then noticed some movement coming from the trees next to her that was then that callie was able to see diana she was very good at hiding diana had been waiting for awhile and noticed that nobody approaching the flag pole which she found to be really suspicious she suspected that some of them were hiding she was watching the trees closely and finally noticed a flash of a muzzle and decided to see if she could not force one of them to show himself or herself she moved very quickly into view and immediately ducked it was then that she saw lisa diana aimed her gun at lisa as she came into view and shot her on the arm lisa walked out and headed off the field a little while later hermione and harry came into the area they were both surveying their environments and looking for their team mates as well as for each other hermione spotted callie and slowly tried to walk towards her but she was shot at diana had been aiming at her callie noticed this and moved closer towards diana and was able to spot her really well she aimed her gun at her and shot but missed diana turned towards the direction her shooter had shot from and thought that she noticed a glimmer of a flag she then aimed her gun back at callie and shot and missed as well hermione noticed that the shooting had stopped at her and saw that callie was getting shot at aimed at diana as she was aiming for callie and shot at her but she missed hermione decided that she needed to distract her and moved closer to the flag pole near diana hermione hid behind some trees and was able to see diana very well with minimal blockage she aimed her gun at diana and this time was able to hit her well in the shoulder diana dropped her gun and walked off the field harry witnessed diana getting shot but didnthelp because it was too late and decided that it was best to wait for a good opportunity before eliminating callie and hermione hermione reached callie and said okay so you need to get near the flag pole okay callie nodded and slowly looked around before running off and hiding behind the next available tree hermione followed in the same fashion callie reached the pole and was about to put it back on the pole when she saw a paintball land near her callie quickly hung up the flag and ran for cover harry took this opportunity and followed her path and when the right moment arrived he aimed and he was able to hit callie in back callie then walked off the field leaving harry and hermione hermione was looking around realizing that harry was near by she knew that in order for her to see him she would have to trick him into coming up or showing himself knowing harry he probably wouldntshow himself until she did she would have to show herself in a way that would prevent him from trying to shoot her hermione got up in plain sight with her flag and pretended to trip she then saw harry coming out to see if she was okay and she smiled and got up and quickly aimed her gun at him at shot at him but harry was too fast and she missed him surrender hermione harry asked i cantdo that we re too close hermione replied with a smile harry moved closer to her and asked again surrender nope i can t what are you doing hermione asked nervously i going to get you to give me the flag he answered no physical force in this game right she asked who said anything about physical force harry asked hermione began to move back and said harry look out behind you harry turned around and hermione took this opportunity to run away and hide that wasntfair harry said to hermione hermione just smiled and didntrespond as to give away her hiding place hermione moved closer and closer to the flag pole harry knew that hermione needed to return to the flag pole so he waited for her to appear as he saw her approaching the flag pole while looking around and decided to scare her into dropping the flag so he aimed his gun and shot at a spot near her this caused hermione to stop whatever she was doing but she didntdrop her flag harry then slowly crept up to hermione and came up behind her hermione suddenly turned around with her gun ready but nobody was there hermione decided that she better turn for cover and headed back towards a tree harry took this opportunity to shoot a tree near where hermione was hiding to get her to think he was somewhere else harry went to the pole and grabbed the flag back and at the last minute hermione saw and aimed her gun to fire at him but once again she missed hermione decided to use one last tactic she came out and called out harry can we talk harry came out cautiously and said what about well i was thinking about maybe surrendering i mean you
