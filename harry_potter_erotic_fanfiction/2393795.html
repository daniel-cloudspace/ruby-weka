sometimes parents are a drag yes mother lily evans closed her journal not a diary and stuffed it into her purse the redhead then opened her bedroom door to see her redheaded mother standing outside with her arms crossed over her chest lily stood up on her tiptoes and planted a wet kiss on her mother rosy cheek the redhead then skipped down the stairs and went outside to see her father loading her trunk into the back of the 74 camaro her father henry looked more like her horse of a sister petunia but in a handsome kind of way he had floppy brown hair that showed his receding hairline he had the same dark eyes as her sister as well as the tall skinny giraffe like figure he unlike petunia was pleasant to talk to he always knew how to crack a joke but he wore horrendous clothing he liked those repulsive argyle sweaters vests and everything else imaginable hey bright eyes you can sit in the back with petty mr evans waved a hand towards his youngest child as he inspected the back of his prized car for scratches ha ha daddy that was funny lily rolled her head back in fake laughter i thought you actually said to get in the back of this car here get in the car lillian mrs evans opened the front door to the camaro and hauled her small frame into the car i promise she wontbite henry walked in front of his daughter how do you know she isnta vampire or even a werewolf for that matter lily spoke with a slight whine in her mouth considering your sister distant relative you mean the redhead interrupted with a smile playing on her lips petunia you mean it lily supplied condescendingly lillian henry cocked his head to the side father the fifteen year old redhead mimicked her parent get in the car lily sighed dramatically before walking over to her father car opening the door and slowly ever so slowly slid into the back seat next to her fuming sister the witch who could never pass up the chance to royally annoy her bigsister leaned over towards the brunette as the car pulled out of the driveway ickle bickle bockle boo mother petunia shouted freak here is doing magic on me lillian rose turned around and glared at her daughter petunia you two stop it right now lily stop tormenting your sister and petunia stop calling your sister names petunia glared at her sister before turning to stare at the scenery that passed by her lily on the other hand crossed her arms over her chest and silently congratulated herself for a job well done the redhead turned her attention to her purse only to pull out a paperback book entitled peter pan by j m barrie she pulled out her flower covered bookmark and began to read it seemed as though they arrived at king cross extremely quickly which was both a blessing and a curse one she got to get away from her sister two she didntget to finish her book her father parked the car and went in search for a trolley while rose petunia and lily walked towards platform 9 a couple minutes later henry appeared with lily trunk in a trolley bye sweetheart rose kissed her daughter on the forehead as she embraced the younger redhead lily pulled back and turned towards her father her favorite parent the fifteen year old launched herself at the man hugging him with her arms wrapped tightly around his neck she stayed in her father arms for a while watching as the people passed it was henry who pulled away first he patted his daughter on the top of her curly red head be good bright eyes he spoke softly make me proud as long as you make me proud lily smiled brightly lily turned towards her sister and nodded her head in the seventeen year old direction petunia however didnteven take notice of her sister somewhat kind gesture lily just rolled her eyes as she grabbed her trolley she bid one last farewell to her parents before closed her eyes and ran through the wall onto the platform lily felt a slight shimmer go through her body when she crossed the magical barrier her eyelids flew opened and her emerald eyes sparkled as they landed on the scarlet engine a smile once again lit up her pale face as she looked around expectantly the redhead pushed her trolley towards the train when her eyes caught someone over to the left of her she snapped her head towards the direction of the familiar boy there he was the boy whom girls practically drooled over his black hair fell elegantly into his pale eyes his clothes hung loosely on his thin frame his demeanor was always haughty and bored except for right now it was as if the boy deemed everyone inferior to him it was sirius black attitude that made lily despise the boy with sirius black was a younger version of him only that boy was slightly paler and had a longer nose the boy who was most likely sirius brother looked around the age of thirteen next to the two boys were most likely their parents the man looked exactly like sirius except for the expression on his face sirius father had a look of disgust as he watched several of the students pass by sirius mother had eyes that were narrowed and a sadistic smile was twisted upon her features her mouth was twitching slightly as her hand rested on sirius shoulder lily couldnthelp but feel curiosity surging through her whole body she had never seen sirius black looking so helpless and sad before the redhead strolled up towards sirius not knowing exactly why she cared why the boy whom she had always hated looked so sad mudbloods and muggles all over the platform and out mrs black voice was one of complete disgust vermin if you ask me vermin is an understatement mr black spoke swiftly i want nothing but the best of you sirius do you understand me mrs black turned towards her son and dug her fingernails into the boy pale cheeks it bad enough that i have a piece of shit for a son but i will not tolerate any more of your outbursts i sorry if i dontmeet your standard of approval sirius voice was thick with sarcasm dontbe smart with me boy mrs black growled i dontknow why i put up with you you re not even good enough to get the prefect position what do you want me to say if you dontwant me to apologize for things that werenteven my faul donttake that tone with me the woman hissed under her breath you are incredibly frustrating and irritating to look at let along talk to lily felt the urge to save sirius she pushed her trolley closer and yelled out sirius name mrs black jumped back in surprise releasing her son in the process the handsome teenager turned around to see the redhead not far away from him he rubbed his face gingerly where there were the crescent marks from his mother fingernails evans sirius questioned a shocked look on his face sirius black why haventyou owled me all summer lily pulled the sweetest look on her face that she could muster i was ever so lonely i was hoping oh wishing that you would owl me sirius looked at lily like he d never seen anything like her before he knew it lily had linked her arm with his and was dragging him towards her the redhead had politely introduced herself to the blacks as she complimented their son mr and mrs black looked at the girl with narrow eyes knowing she wasnta pureblood based on her last name so funny this boy is right here lily smiled brightly as she pulled sirius back with her quite handsome too nice meeting you sirius with a dumbfounded look on his face walked towards the train with lily he helped the redhead load her heavy trunk onto the train all the while never sharing a word the whistle blew loudly warning the students to get on the engine before it pulled away the two fifteen year old gryffindors just got on the train as it started to leave the station uhh why did you pretend to be my friend and pull me away from my family sirius spat out the word family as if it were the foulest thing ever you looked like you were getting pretty beaten down lily responded i know i hate it when i get belittled so i thought i d save you the grief why do you care if i get yelled at sirius questioned her with his eyes flaring since when has perfect lily evans ever helped someone out that she thought was an arrogant prick i sorry if i tried to help you your highness lily shouted next time i ll let your mother dig her fingernails so deep into your cheeks that you bleed for days true to her redheaded personality lily stomped her foot hard into the ground and stormed off to the prefect compartment for her first prefect meeting she didnteven want to be a stupid prefect lily knew that she wasntthe smartest girl in her year in gryffindor she didntstudy she knew practically nothing about potions and herbology and she could care less if students were out of bed past curfew she strolled into the prefect compartment to see the head boy frank longbottom and head girl paris van arden sitting at a table with fifth sixth and seventh year prefects lily scanned the small group of people hoping to find something that she knew and liked and you are paris van arden thought that she was just the smartest and greatest person on the face of the earth but lily thought she was hideous and dumb paris was in ravenclaw she didntfit the regular ravenclaw standards like the other ravenclaws lily knew paris was a ditzy big breasted idiot she had dark brown hair that was dyed blonde her skin was so tan that she looked like toast she wore horribly too much make up and she reminded lily of a prostitute lily evans fifth year gryffindor prefect lily pulled on a tight smile would you like to know anything else perhaps my linage or how i look so fantastic frank longbottom smiled softly as lily and motioned her to sit down next to him lily had only met frank briefly before she knew that he was the keeper on the gryffindor quidditch team the redhead also knows that frank had befriended james potter and sirius black since they were all on the same quidditch team frank seemed like a nice bloke who was excellent in defense against the dark arts some say that the only student in the whole school that could come close to beating him in a duel was james potter lily took the seat next to frank when her eyes caught a small sickly looking boy his sandy hair was lying limply on top of his unnaturally pale face his amber eyes glistened with tears and there was an expression of pure anguish on his face his hands were holding the side of his chest and lily thought she saw something red between his fingers remus lupin saw the fellow prefect staring at his hands and immediately tried to cover up as much of his side as he could lily looked at the other people in the room and noted the fifth year prefects severus snape a hooked nose boy who always seemed to have long greasy hair his hair was always in his menacing face he had a stare that would scare little children next to him was bellatrix black she was really pretty in lily eyes bellatrix had long flowing black hair she had the same pale eyes as sirius black whom lily supposed was her cousin she had an exotic beauty that the redhead would never be able to achieve the witch gaze wandered over to the ravenclaw section in search for other fifth year prefects guinevere haswell was a fellow redhead she was an incredible nice girl and amazingly smart lily always knew that guinevere would get the prefect position lily was a nice acquaintance of guinevere s lily would be willing to bet that guinevere would be head girl when they enter their seventh year brent paddock was a handsome boy who played beater for the ravenclaw quidditch team lily would be lying if she said she never had a crush on the chocolate colored haired and blue eyed boy he too was pure ravenclaw smart beyond recognition lily eyes wandered again to find the hufflepuffs she found them soon enough for they were all wearing bright yellow the redhead blinked her eyes a times to focus them on the group of people it took her awhile to figure out who were the fifth years for she never really had classes with hufflepuff the male prefect was oxford stover who was a very shy boy his name was only known since lily had remembered his name on the letter she got over the summer he had short chestnut hair and warm brown eyes if anything the redhead would call him a wallflower skylar devereux was the female hufflepuff prefect she played seeker for her house quidditch team she wasntvery good then again lily could barely ride a broom and she was criticizing a girl who had the guts to play on a team of all males skylar was a tomboy with her blonde hair always pulled back into a messy ponytail but yet she could be elegant when she wanted any complaints franks looked around the room lily shook her head and watched as the prefects seemed to have agreed with whatever just happened had she really tuned out the head boy speech for that long lily caught remus eyes and raised her eyebrows in the air as if to tell him to say something the pallid boy looked puzzled for several seconds before it seemed to dawn on him what lily was trying to say the gryffindor straightened himself up as he winced in pain ex excuse me remus asked timidly yes paris asked in an annoyed tone the the patrol that lily and i are supposed to have on on september 20th remus inquired can that be changed oh lily laughed quietly that it excuse me paris whipped her dyed head towards laughing girl you re excused lily responded as a couple of the prefects chuckled do you think you re cute or something paris asked as she twirled a piece of her stiff hair between her fingers oh no i know i cute lily placed her chin in her left hand and twirled a piece of auburn hair between her long fingers that got several smiles from the prefects even the head boy and remus lupin seemed to enjoy the display nobody particularly liked paris but no one would actually mock the girl to her face that was what set lily apart from everyone else she wasntafraid to be bold but she would never do anything to purposely hurt anyone she was a clean joker what date do you want to change the patrol remus frank asked the sickly boy with a smile playing on his face lily can pick remus offered the girl a smile i dontcare frankie lily spoke in a singsong tone gimme a good date and i ll be happy how about the twenty first is that okay remus frank asked as he wrote down the new date sure by the time the trained reached hogwarts lily had a nice stack of papers there were timetables for the patrols for the first semester of school there were two other dates that remus saw fit in changing did he even consider his partner no he didn t it was very nice of him indeed since remus felt bad about changing three dates he volunteered to patrol tonight it was the first day back at hogwarts and lily was stuck patrolling the redhead disliked the timid boy for volunteering her services lily stepped off the scarlet engine turned towards remus lupin and thanked him for offering her night away to look for first years who were most likely to explore her voice was thick with sarcasm and fake cheer the male prefect blushed profusely and apologized saying that he would patrol on his own lily however cut him off with a wave of the hand and simply said next time talk to me first the redhead stood outside of the train watching for her friends to come off soon enough lily saw a tan girl with black hair walking off the train behind her was a girl with curly chestnut hair small frames were perched on her nose as she held several books in her arms rhiannon cromwell is a git lily said in a singsong tone lily evans is a bigheaded prat the dark haired girl that had just come off the train rushed towards lily and enveloped her into a hug all summer i was stuck in my house with the evil flower and you didnteven write lily pulled away from the girl and turned towards the brunette i was in sweden for a holiday the girl replied hey lily the brunette and the redhead hugged why hello miss august lily parted the hug to look at her friend you barely wrote we went on vacation to germany to spend time with my grandparents august diefendorf replied with a small smile sorry i bored the tall tan girl spoke in a slightly arrogant tone rhia please calm down lily smirked as she linked her arm with her best friend i hungry you only think of your stomach august interrupted the three girls laughed with arms linked the friends stepped into a horseless carriage and rode along to the magnificent castle small talk was exchanged as the girls talked about their summers lily had the least to talk about for she was stuck at home her whole holiday she listened rapidly to her friend tales of the far away lands she had never been too okay so maybe they werentso far away but a girl can pretend cantshe the finally reached the castle looking the same as ever the comrades jumped out of the carriage and stared up at the stone palace the redhead sighed contently she was home the nostalgic feeling the redhead had felt all summer was slowly slipping away the statues the secret passage ways and the hogsmeade visits were all greatly missed the being late for class the quidditch matches and the sleepless nights in the dormitories were highly appreciated this was truly home the girls walked into the fortress and were suddenly greeted by the welcoming aura of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ghosts were about flying in every direction the students talked excitedly as they made their way into the great hall the great hall was beautifully decorated with banners of the four houses along with streamers the four colors of hogwarts lily took a seat at the gryffindor table which was covered in scarlet and gold the dishes and silverware were placed neatly on the scarlet tablecloth the napkins were held together but a gold band with a small gryffindor lion embossed on them the goblets with their ancient carvings were screaming to be filled everything was perfect and nothing could change the magical meal that the students and faculty were about to share together it was then that a messy hair boy caught lily attention her emerald eyes wandered from the flawless table setting to james potter he still had the same thick black glasses that hid his hazel eyes his black hair was still a monstrosity the boy strolled to gryffindor table as if he were the muggle king of england the genuine smile was spread across his lips as always james sat down next to his best friend sirius black you would never see the two without each other it was as if they were joined at the hip earth to lily rhia waved a hand in front of her friend psst miss evans table sixteen is now available what lily turned towards her best friend with a look of puzzlement on her face what are you going on about i was simply trying to pull your attention off of the scrumptious james potter rhia flipped her black hair behind her shoulder argh potter that arrogant prick lily had a look of pure disgust on her face why in the name of all that is holy would i be looking at him because he funny smart cute and not to mention head over heels for you the day i got out with james potter is the day that professor truax actually starts doing his job and stops tormenting the students professor truax was the potions master at hogwarts he was the head of slytherin house and he had very biased ideas he was one of those people who you loved to hate only the slytherins seemed to get along with him which was saying something there were rumors traveling around the school that professor truax was involved in a dark cult with a wizard that many were starting to fear some called him you know who but lily was completely baffled as to whom he was exactly being a muggleborn she never really knew what exactly was going on in the wizarding world maybe he had a tormenting childhood august lifted her nose from the thick book she was reading maybe hejust really wants to be a she lily supplied and is embarrassed to admit it a he she rhia questioned as august snorted you know he was born a he but wanted to be a she so he dressed up in his sister clothing and all the other kids poked fun at him and lily trailed off i ll stop now what are you even talking about rhia came from a long line of pureblooded witches and wizards she basically knew nothing of the muggle world and that was one of the reasons that she had been taking muggle studies since she was thirteen august was a half blood her mother was a witch and her father was a muggle she was raised as a muggle but knew of the magical world before she arrived at hogwarts sometimes i just ramble about stupid things lily smiled you should know that by now something you utterly baffle me lily evans rhia replied as she glanced down where sirius black and james potter were laughing with remus lupin and peter pettigrew it part of my charm lily answered with a sigh people just cantget enough of me they never know what i ll say next that an understatement rhia muttered the dark haired girl reached over across lily to where august was sitting she grabbed the book from the bookish girl august made a sound of protest and reached out to snatch her book back rhia was too quick however and looked at the front of the book to read the title was fliegst du rhia wrinkled her nose horribly pronouncing the words what does that mean where are you flying august spoke calmly as she made another futile attempt to get her book back i not flying anywhere rhia replied smugly it german the brunette exclaimed i german and i read german books why would you read a book about flying the dark haired girl questioned it talks about all wizarding communities around the europe august answered as she buried her nose back into the book rhia and lily then made small talk letting august continue with her beloved book the girls talked about nothing in particular just nonsensical banter it wasntbefore long that the first years filed into the grand dining hall with professor mcgonagall some first years looked to be in awe but others seemed slightly nervous the transfiguration professor went up towards a stool and the sorting hat the raggedy hat sang a particularly boring song as usual one that lily didnteven pay attention to she pulled out a list seemingly from nowhere and started calling the names of the first years who were to be sorted the professor strict voice called out the first name ayres calandra a very short pale girl stepped up to the sorting hat looking as though she d go down like a ton of bricks any second look at my brother the idiot rhia sighed as calandra was sorted into ravenclaw he looks really different lily eyes landed on the tan boy with a mop of curly black hair he had the same blue eyes as his older sister not to mention the tall and thin frame he had a smug smile on his face as if he was half plotting something cromwell jonathan mcgonagall called out the next first year bet you anything johnny will do something for attention rhia watched as her eleven year old brother walk up towards the stool very slowly and dramatically i bet he starts screaming when the hat touches his head and screams it eating me i being eaten lily smiled widely as the hat touched his head the dark haired girl laughed as she watched her brother under the sorting hat it seemed to take forever before the hat had exclaimed gryffindor lily and rhia stood up and cheered their claps and cheers were the loudest out of everyone johnny cromwell looked at his sister and her best friend in disbelief he blushed furiously and made a motion as to give a very rude gesture to them but thought better of it the list of students seemed to go on forever maybe it was the fact that nobody was playing attention to the sorting that it seemed longer then usual lily and rhia had resorted to playing tic tac toe on a napkin lily had already won six games with her mad skills and rhia had won only two i dontunderstand how you always get three in a row rhia sighed as lily grinned widely if i told you my secrets lily spoke as she lazily drew a small flower in the top right corner of the new tic tac toe board then i would have to kill you august told me to always go for the middle first rhia drew a large star with several smaller stars around it in the middle of the board but you go for the corners that my friend is called strategy lily drew another flower in the bottom left corner whatever rhia sighed as a clicking sound filled the dining hall welcome welcome back to hogwarts welcome to the first years the headmaster smiled warmly at the student body albus dumbledore was the loveable eccentric headmaster of hogwarts he was ever so old but in the right light you could see the redness of his hair show through he had a terribly long white beard that flowed to his stomach he had sparkly blue eyes that were hidden behind haywire eyebrows and moon shaped glasses the bright smile that was almost always on his face made him look a good fifty years younger there was an ageless kindness about him his juvenile personality was always well received i have a few notices before we tuck into your delicious food professor dumbledore held out his arms as he if were half expecting someone to run up and give him a hug i must remind you that the forbidden forest is off limits to all students mr filch has also asked me to inform you that he has made a list over the summer of all things that are prohibited in the school the headmaster looked over towards james potter and sirius black with a huge smile dancing on his face it was a genuine smile that reached his eyes and every other part of his body the old man adverted his eyes from the two best friends and looked at the rest of the student body you can view the list on the door of mr filch office i sure he would be more then thrilled to talk it over with any of you if you have a comment or question professor dumbledore sighed contently let dig in shall we there were several motions of agreement as the aging man clapped his hands together making mountains of food appear out of nowhere the chatter in the room was in full force hands were reaching out from every direction to grab the delicious food that the students had missed all summer it wasntlong before the food had disappeared into the stomachs of the students and staff it was then when the prefects had to show the first years to their dormitories lily was less then thrilled about this when she was done then she had to patrol with shy quite remus lupin the boy never seemed to talk to anyone except those blasted friends of his lily and remus walked the first years to gryffindor tower as rhia sirius and james pretended that they too were first years james seemed to be following them as if he were a little kid afraid to move too far away from his parents it was annoying since james went along sirius was sure to follow he couldntgo anywhere without james potter at his side pathetic really it was as if sirius was a lost dog without his master then rhia the girl was obsessed with sirius black she was one of the many it was double pathetic in her case now listen to me lily turned around to face the first years as they approached the fat lady i dontwant to be a prefect but i am i dontwant to patrol tonight but i have to you probably want to explore but you can t if i see any of you out of bounds on my patrol night i ll give you two months detentions understood spread it around to the other houses the first years looked oddly at each other slightly afraid of the redhead rhia looked at her best friend with a huge smile on her face the three marauders looked at her with a mixture of shock and admiration heart parade lily told the fat lady as the portrait flung open get inside and stay inside come on lupin remus jumped slightly and looked at his friends for help the redhead swore she heard sirius black tell the prefect to be carefully around lily and that lily might bite the female prefect didntcare however she just wanted to get this over with it was weird walking through the deserted castle it was extremely boring as well did remus lupin ever talk personally lily wanted to bang her head on every wall in hogwarts the time seemed to be passing at an excruciatingly slow rate if you could die from boredom lily would have been long gone by now are you incapable of talking lily finally broke the silence thirty five minutes and twenty five seconds later what he speaks we ve been walking around on a patrol you volunteered me for and you haventsaid one single sodding word lily exclaimed i bored i need entertainment i sorry the sandy haired boy blushed furiously i not really one for conversations nah lily voice was thick with sarcasm i would have never guessed the boy didntrespond and the two lapsed into complete silence yet again the redhead kept telling herself the patrol was only two hours long two hours long that was a long time in complete silence ten minutes and forty five seconds passed until lily spoke yet again cantwe at least talk to make the time pass quicker lily voice whined talk about what remus inquired with his hands stuffed in his pockets listen i dontmean to be rude or anything like that but we re partners we are going to be working together until we graduate unless you become head boy lily stopped and faced the fellow teenager we need to become friends and talk so this isntsomething i dread every week i dontwant that you re a really nice guy so pretend i james potter or sirius black or even that peter pettigrew lily looked the boy with a pleading look in her eyes the boy bit his lip as he contemplated what to do this hesitation made lily feel horrible was she really that bad to talk to what was wrong with her why wouldnthe just say that he would try or something like that was petunia right was she just a freak right sorry then lily turned away and started down the hallway i didntknow i was that bad no no remus said frantically it not that you re not you re not bad i mean it just complicated right lily opened a classroom door and looked for anyone out of bounds no i mean okay remus walked in front of her i remus lupin i fifteen and i live in with my parents outside of dover i an only child i lily evans i also fifteen and i live with my parents as well but i live in windsor unfortunately i have a sister whom i would just love to flog remus turned towards the redhead with a slightly alarmed face he watched as lily broke into a wide smile and struck a little pose the boy couldnthelp but smile as a soft very soft chuckle escaped his lips yes lily had done it she had broken the ice she had paved the way to a lasting friendship the rest of the patrol went by quickly as the two got to know each other they learned about each other favorite classes and teachers they learned about each other summers and friends it was magnificent by the time the patrol was over lily was slightly disappointed the two made their way back to gryffindor tower remember last year when there was a rumor going around the whole school that someone had found mcgonagall and dumbledore snogging in an abandoned classroom lily asked as remus said the password do you know who did it yeah well remus let out a nervous laugh that was kind of james and sirius who started it you re joking arentyou i wish i was remus pulled a tight smile on his face were you part of it the boy looked extremely guilty perfect innocent smart little remy lupin helped spread a rumor that made mcgonagall take off fifty points from each house and canceled a hogsmeade weekend it wasntmy idea remus explained i just went along with it that what they all say lily smiled widely that what they all say lily smiled widely as she waved a hand in remus direction as if to say goodnight the girl yawned loudly before prancing up the stairs to the girl dormitory she opened the door to see rhia sitting on her bed with her arms crossed over her chest if it isntlily evans back from the dead if it isntrhia cromwell back from hell lily grinned as she went over to her wardrobe to change into her pajamas how was patrol with the ever so bashful remus rhia seemed to be having too much fun with whatever she was planning good lily pulled a shirt over her head we talked about your friends rhia shot up in her bed did he say anything about sirius yes actually he did lily half lied sure they talked about the marauders and lily friends but there were no details involved there were just small things exchanged there wasntany life changing information but rhia was always the hopeful one who does sirius like did he say rhia jumped off her bed and practically ran to dive on lily bed yes he did lily lied apparently sirius got a girl pregnant twice actually sirius is sirius has children yep there going to be a shotgun wedding shotgun wedding rhia looked confused he going to have to marry the girl at wand point oh who is it lily shrugged her shoulders and buried herself in the covers it was a redhead that had started the rumor about a one sirius black just to poke fun at her best friend it was kelly watson who had overheard the conversation from her bed in the fifth year dormitory it was kelly watson who told everyone that sirius had two children then it was sirius who received a howler from his mother about representing the black family in such a light it was then lily evans who would feel bad about spreading a false rumor and would try to apologize to sirius it was a domino effect of sorts author notes i hope you enjoyed the first chapter it kinda choppy i guess first chapters are always horrible to write please leave me a review if you want me to continue anyone a quick beta and would like to help me out chapter summary you look so whorish that it isnteven funny lily said seriously i bought it today you had a perfectly nice costume be that was until i found out sirius black is going as a dog

rapidly to get the point values made out the highest amount of points you can get for one achievement is 500 and that only if you save someone life the smallest point values were 10 and that was for

august made the score sheets everything is ready for tomorrow kick off day the score sheets look amazing rhia august and i or the mirages as the boys now call us have been attempting to make nicknames rhia was very adamant about being named the boobs but somehow august talked her out of it i really wanted to be bloodsucking fiend but i was told it was a bit too long we did manage to pick names only the boys hate them with a fiery passion i blossom rhia is raven august is smarty the marauders said that those names were too girly so they re picking new names for us oh joys beyond joys i can only imagine the outrageous things they will name us lily sat next to august eating breakfast it wasntfair that she had to stay behind from a hogsmeade visit just to get the great hall ready for the halloween party that night she would much rather go out with rhia and august or even with brent of course she couldntthough stupid prefect obligations the redhead stabbed her sausage with her fork as an annoying voice called out her name sirius black stood behind her he picked up lily satchel on the space next to her and threw it onto the table he then took the seat for himself sirius smiled at her as he brushed a lock of black hair behind his ear lily looked from sirius to the school bag on the table she then said i was saving that seat for my best friend good thing i got here before anyone else took it then sirius spoke cheerfully as he grabbed a piece of sausage from the redhead plate hey get your dirty fingers away from my food lily swatted at sirius hand as he plopped the piece of sausage into his mouth royally annoyed at sirius lily took a free plate and loaded a mountain of sausages onto it she then placed it in front of sirius with a smile spread widely across her face the boy didntlook amused what with the ears lily questioned on top of sirius head was a black headband that had two pointy dog ears sticking out on the top lily reached out a pale finger flicked the fake ear closest to her sirius let out a yelp of pain and swatted her hand away from his ear that part of me you know sirius snapped playfully as he snatched another sausage from lily plate what up with the ears lily asked again it part of my costume for tonight what part of masquerade dontyou understand so what people know who i am big deal sirius stated with annoyance lacing his words what are you going to be lily didntsay anything instead she just turned towards her breakfast and continued to eat it sirius asked her again in a whiney voice but the redhead didntdare say a word the table started to fill up rhia had taken a seat across from her best friend with james potter sitting right next to her the two were whispering to each other as if they were plotting something it was annoying lily so she tried not to pay attention to them within twenty minutes everyone started filing out of the great hall to go to hogsmeade the younger students went to lounge in their common rooms or around the castle the prefects stayed in the great hall most looking sulky and moody remus appeared behind lily and took a seat next to her with a smile etched upon his drawn face the head boy and girl were standing in front of the teacher table all the decorations are in that room frank started as he pointed to a door not far away from the professor table i want the decorations put up and the tables set professors flitwick and mcgonagall were nice enough to stay behind with us to help us with the huge pieces of furniture that need to be moved out and brought in get with your group pick an area and start putting everything together lily and remus went towards alice prewett and frank longbottom mcgonagall and flitwick started banishing the house tables and replacing them with small round tables chairs appeared all over the great hall as well as boxes lily opened one box to see it was filled with dishes and silverware the redhead groaned she hated setting tables remus and lily were put on duty of setting up the tables they covered each table with tablecloths that were adorned in dancing pumpkins with witch hats on their heads the plates were then placed in front of the chairs when lily was setting one of the tables she heard a gruff voice say oy i dancing here the redhead picked up the plate she had just placed down to see a sullen looking pumpkin lily made sure not to place any more plates on the pumpkins which was difficult because they were dancing all over the tablecloths the great hall looked magnificent from every angle craved pumpkins were suspended in midair with orange and black candles the tables looked wondrous in the middle of the room was sparse for dancing streamers were everywhere there was a huge colorful banner behind the professor table that read happy halloween with pictures of dancing pumpkins witches black cats and everything else dealing with halloween the banner was made by the artsy daniel thomas the prefects were exhausted after hours of decorating they treaded back to their common rooms to get ready for the party in a couple hours the other students were just coming back from hogsmeade lily walked into her dormitory and collapsed upon her bed several minutes later rhia and august walked in have fun august asked oh oodles lily spoke sarcastically all the girls rushed around the room to get ready for the halloween feast all but lily that was she had fallen asleep at some point lily only knew this for she was rudely shaken awake by her best friend in a ridiculous getup rhia had a black bodysuit on that looked as though it was two sizes too small she wore pointed black ears which looked oddly like sirius s around rhia eyes were thick layers of kohl to act as a mask her nose was powered pink and small whiskers came out from under her nose you look so whorish that it isnteven funny lily said seriously i bought it today you had a perfectly nice costume be that was until i found out sirius black is going as a dog so you wanted to be a cat because cats and dogs go so well together shut it you lily rolled her eyes dramatically and shot a look of utter disbelief to her friend without another word the redhead got up and went over to her wardrobe to pull out her halloween costume she felt slightly silly to have picked out such a costume but it was the only thing she could think of in such a short amount of time she was going to be a fairytale witch she had a long black dress that she cut up at the bottom so that the bottom was shaped in several pieces of pointed fabric she then sewed on orange triangles to fill in the spaces at the base of the dress she wore clunky black boots that made her several inches taller she placed a black witch hat on top of her red head lily then covered her face in a green powder and a fake green nose with a wart on the very tip tada lily exclaimed as she struck a pose and you say i look like a whore rhia muttered you look so beautiful lily august commented as she stepped out of the bathroom august looked stunning the usual plain bookish girl had decked out for the occasion she was a mermaid and looked superb her chestnut hair was pulled in loose curls her top looked like something out of the sea it had a plunging neckline it was made of lace was adorned with colors that could only be found under the sea her skirt flowed down to her knees and looked as thought it was made out of kelp and seaweed there was a mask over her eyes with sparkly fish covering them i love your mask lily cried i attached it to my glasses so that i could see very resourceful the three girls linked arms and walked down to the great hall as soon as they stepped inside august and rhia gasped in shock the place looked magnificent and the two voiced their opinions several students were already in the great hall with their costumes on the girls were about to find a table to claim as their own when an arm reached out and grabbed lily elbow it was a gently touch that sent shivers through lily body the redhead turned around to see someone dressed in the silliest getup it made lily burst out into a fit of giggles the boy standing behind her wore white tights with a blue old fashioned top embellished in ruffles he had on tassel shoes on his head was a hat with two huge feathers sticking out his eyes were covered with a sleek black mask what are you supposed to be rhia asked as she too had erupted in a fit of giggles with august prince charming the boy declared as he bowed my fair ladies the boy voice sounded so familiar but lily couldntplace it green eyes wandered over his features to try to place whom he was but she couldn t the boy stood up straight and lily looked into his sparkling hazel eyes lily had thought for a split second that the mystery boy was brent but her boyfriend didnthave those intriguing eyes or the comical personality care for a dance the boy asked as he reached out a hand lily took the hand without thinking a smile was spread widely across her face as the boy led her out to the middle of the dance floor the prefect thought of brent and how she was cheating on him but that thought was quickly pushed from her mind it really wasnt cheating they were only dancing it wasntlike lily was going to snog the boy senseless or anything like that the mystery boy wrapped one arm around lily thin waist and pulled her close to him so that there was no space between their bodies his other hand found the redhead pale hand and he held it gently towards his chest lily melted in his grasp and positioned her free hand onto the boy shoulder for the first time in her short life lily felt as though she completely belonged it was as though mr charming and lily were meant to spend the rest of their lives together everything was lost to lily as she swayed with mr charming as lily had now dubbed him the redhead didntnotice anything that was going on around her she was lost in the hazel orbs as she tried to place who this boy was mr charming had a smile planted on his face that never left as he danced with lily the music stopped and the headmaster voice filled the great hall lily reluctantly turned around to face the headmaster who was dressed in a santa claus suit the prefect couldnthelp but let out a laugh as mr charming chuckled behind her professor dumbledore had a huge burlap bag resting next to him there was a sullen woman standing next to him dressed up as mrs claus it took lily a minute or two to realize that the woman was actually professor mcgonagall i see that almost all the students are here the jolly headmaster announced we ll have an hour for mingling and dancing and then the delicious halloween feast will be served so bip bip my young students and have a glorious evening lily turned back to mr charming to see that his smile looked as though it was smiling going to tear his face apart her emerald eyes wandered over to her best friend who was dancing with a boy in black dogs ears a black eye mask a black t shirt and jeans that had a pointy tail sticking out the back sirius black really wasnta very creative person at all lily searched the great hall for august she immediately spotted her bookish friend who was dancing with a boy covered in a white sheet there were holes for his hands to go through on the front of the sheet was written boo in black marker so would you like to tell me about yourself mr charming asked sweetly well i awfully clumsy and sometimes truly clueless but i ve got friends that love me for all my flaws lily answered cryptically how about you i crazy but in a good way the boy replied with his lovely low chuckle is that so lily inquired playfully quite so the boy said with another chuckle i such a loser at times so forgive me if i say anything offensive you may be a loser but i love it the words had slipped out of lily mouth before she could stop herself what had gotten into her she was openly flirting with a complete stranger when she had a brilliant boyfriend in the same room lily bit her lip and decided to forget about brent he could be out there right now flirting with some random girl it wasntlike brent had tried to find out what lily would be so he could hang out with her at the party quite the opposite brent had been avoiding her for the past week so where are your friends mr charming asked i could ask you the same thing oh they re dead the boy declared jokingly everyone knows i killed them but nobody seems to be able to find the bodies there were screams from the left of lily and mr charming they whipped their heads around to see a couple first years had fallen into the enormous apple bobbing container they were soaking wet and professor mcgonagall or mrs claus was hollering at them for disturbing the party students around them were guffawing at them never underestimate the power stupid people hold in groups mr charming told her never underestimate the power ickle first years hold in any type of group they are utter restless and idiots i highly offended by that miss creepy witch mr charming said while smiling like a bloody fool when i was a first year i was poised intelligent and overall the best student ever what happened to you then lily sniggered what you said was lily smugly replied a smile stretched upon her face that indicating that you arent smart and poised anymore the boy burst out laughing and immediately lily starting laughing as well several people turned to look at them but the two didnteven notice as soon as mr charming had calmed down a bit he said it funnier now that i get it that simple comment made lily burst out in another fit of giggles that she couldntcontrol the two never left the dance floor once they slowly swayed the whole time oblivious to everything happening around them the two had realized at one point that they were the only two still standing on the dance floor professor dumbledore stood behind them with a smile etched on his wrinkly face he politely asked them to take a seat there was a definite twinkle in his eyes as the two teenagers turned crimson although no one knew lily actually blushed due to the fact that her face was smeared in green powder the two sat down at the table with rhia august sirius and the ghost boy lily took a seat next to rhia as mr charming sat down next to lily rhia nudged her best friend in the ribs the raven haired girl puckered up her lips and then mouthed the word scrumptious lily laughed before turning towards the delectable cuisine through the whole meal lily kept glancing at mr charming he was too good to be true the redhead had so many thoughts filling her head that she didntknow which ones to sort out first lily was seriously thinking about dumping brent to go out with mr charming then again what if mr charming was really a jerk and was just playing up the part of being perfect for one night could she risk her wondrous relationship with brent to be with someone whom she didnteven have a name to put with his personality you re so creative lily addressed sirius i know took ages to come up with this costume sirius stated you could have pretended that you cared like you did sirius shot back all you did was put on a hat dress and painted your face green poppet where the rest of your posse lily inquired as she changed the subject i haventseen james or peter all night where remus you ve seen him he at this table right now sirius replied lily looked over to mr charming it couldntbe remus could it no the eyes were different moreover remus wasntthat tall emerald eyes wandered over to the ghost sitting next to august oh it was so fitting that remus was a ghost the boy was awfully shy like that a pale hand from underneath the sheet waved at lily and she waved back with a smile planted on her face he wasntinventive either sirius complained and you arentyelling at him i sorry lily said sincerely remus next patrol i will have to yell at you like there is no tomorrow tonight however i all out of yelling because i spent too much time berating sirius that so stupid sirius whined once the feast was done with the headmaster had granted the students one more hour of partying before they were to go off to dreamland mr charming led lily back out into the dance floor to take their spot that they had previously that night mr charming pulled lily close to his body as the two swayed to the music playing throughout the great hall lily never felt safer or more relaxed with anybody else are you going to tell me your name lily asked as the hour quickly passed then it wouldntbe a masquerade party mr charmed replied mischievously how will we ever keep in touch after tonight you ll see me around but i dontknow who you are well i ll leave you with a kiss and you will remember that kiss and find me again mr charming leaned his head forward slowly towards lily green face the redhead stood up on her tiptoes to lean towards the mysterious boy if lily saw fireworks then she was defiantly going to break it off with brent if not then maybe mr charming wasntlily soul mate after all their lips brushed against each other and lily saw a flash of green obstruct her vision it was hurting her her chest felt as though it was going to explode lily was going to pull away when mr charming grabbed lily by the back of the head and pulled her into a bruising kiss another flash of blinding green light filled her senses as the pain in her chest seemed to increase it burned as though it were on fire the kiss deepened and lily heard high pitched menacing laughter fill her head mr charming pulled apart for a couple seconds to catch his breath and then their lips locked again a frightened female scream filled lily head the woman screamed harry lily tried to mumble stop but she was too weak to she heard the name harry scream through her head once more before darkness filled her she felt as though she was falling down a bottomless pit then everything stopped the pain the laughter and the screaming had all ceased everything was empty lily would never forget the feeling she had when she kissed the mysterious boy it was as though a wave of memories were shouting out to her but lily couldntplace what it meant her chest hurt so much and the light was so bright lily would want answers but she wouldntknow where to find them she would try to push them out of her mind but they would always be haunting her author notes another chapter yay a day late but let not dwell on that the questions from megaroony sparkley tangerine and mkiara were answered in my livejournal the link is in my profile i hope you enjoyed the chapter with a little cliffhanger at the end and please please review for me chapter summary you ve got quite a mouth on you james pointed out as he adjusted his glasses and i dont strut it called walking evans in case you haventnoticed it this newfangled idea where you place one foot in front of the other in order to get places chapter title prongs saves poppet how could this happen how was this even planned it seems so horrible so wrong how can you trust someone completely only to have your heart ripped out and thrown in the gutter like it was nothing why is there so much evil in the world why would anyone want to form an army to attack a group of students just wanting to have some fun a couple people died rhia told me when i woke up i just dontunderstand how this could happen let me take a deep breath and i will write out everything that happened that is if i can get it all out before breaking out in tears i just dontunderstand but here goes nothing the competition was going on fabulously the girls were still in the lead by a good fifty points sirius and james just couldntstay out of detentions and of course whenever they got detentions points were deducted what they lost in detentions they tried to make up in class they succeeded quite well but were still dragging behind there wasntanother challenge like the one that had taken place in the forbidden forest there was to be one each month and december was the month that the girls turn to form the challenge lily rhia and august spent hours trying to figure out a fair but fun challenge so far the three friends hadntcome up with a single thing it was the first weekend in december and that marked the third hogsmeade trip of the year rhia had gotten a date with leo northumberland while lily had gotten a date with brent paddock who had been oddly straying away from his girlfriend for the past month august had commented that she was going hang out as friends with remus lupin the girls all essentially had dates for the outing the air was freezing in december and was whipping across the students faces lily pulled her scarf up farther to protect herself from the bitter cold the sky was dark and snowflakes were slowly cascading down from the clouds the redhead unburied her face and stuck out her tongue to catch several snowflakes brent who was fidgety and nervous glared at her as she did so the boy had looked increasingly paler and thinner than ever what up with you lily questioned as the silence between them was deafening nothing he snapped back lily glanced over at him with a hurt look on her face the gryffindor covered her face up again and stopped eating snowflakes what had been total bliss at the beginning of their relationship turned out to be utter agony the two barely talked anymore about anything it was painful to be together it was as though brent wanted nothing to do with lily any longer the two treaded on in an awkward silence they no longer felt comfortable around each other lily first relationship had officially failed and she didntknow what had happened she blamed herself for there was no one else to blame too bad petunia wasnthere lily thought acrimoniously i could at least blame her for this want a drink asked brent stiffly whatever lily replied uninterested the two walked into the three broomsticks lily had walked towards the back of the pub to save a booth while brent went over to order two drinks the two sat in an uncomfortable silence as they drank their butterbeers brent seemed as though he were thinking about a thousands things at once and that annoyed lily even more why couldnt she be one of the things he was thinking of was that too much to ask of she was his girlfriend after all though probably not much longer lily thought bitterly the door to the pub opened and the ringleaders of the marauders came strolling inside sirius had practically ran to madam rosmerta as he exclaimed how much he liked her new glittery turquoise heels she laughed with a smile playing on her lips as she pushed two drinks over towards james and sirius they clinked the mugs together and drained the contents lily watched them laugh and joke together she watched as sirius put down his drink and sauntered towards the barmaid the boy extended his hand to her she laughed light heartedly and grasped his hand the two danced to no music but laughed the whole time sirius dipped the young woman as she burst out in a fit of giggles the two broke apart with huge smiles etched on their faces madam rosmerta placed an arm around sirius and gave him a friendly peck on the check the redhead smirked at sirius he was always so much fun he never seemed embarrassed or self conscious green eyes wandered over to james potter who was cheering as his best mate walked back over to his seat at the bar lily watched them interact it was as if they were twins with the type of connection they held it was impossible to think of one without thinking of the other many always commented that it seemed as though they were joined at the hip it was never just james or just sirius it was always always james and sirius sometimes it didntmake sense that lily liked sirius as much as she did when she despised james they had the same personality the same sense of humor the same everything their looks were the only thing that separated them sirius had a roguish handsome look about him while james had an adorable little kid look to him girls swooned over both of them lily couldntfind herself to think of sirius as anything but a wacky friend then james lily could picture herself standing in front of the boy dancing with smiles upon their faces but that would never happened james potter only cared about himself and no one else therefore lily and james would never work together lily needed to be loved and cared about she couldntbe used to boost the ego of some self absorbed boy let go brent broke the redhead out of her thoughts just because you want to go doesntmean that i want to lily retorted with an annoyed tone fine brent exasperated stay behind and ogle at potter what lily gasped you think i want to stay behind and look at that arrogant git that what you have been doing the whole time lily he snapped has it ever occurred to you that i simply want to sit in here where it is warm and finish my warm drink rosmerta darling sirius shouted kindly with laughter ringing in his voice another mead please lily snapped her head towards sirius to see him smiling widely with his hand waving in the air the barmaid briskly walked towards the two teenage boys and gave them two more drinks she laughed at something james said and playfully hit his arm she then pointed finger at him and jokingly waved it in front of him while laughing see what i mean brent said dryly i i wasnt ogling at potter lily stated okay then you like black even better brent exclaimed he a filthy blood traitor so your bloods will mix real well our bloods lily inquired yeah dirty blood goes really well together he spat the gryffindor felt tears prickle her eyes dirty blood it rang throughout her head and wouldntstop dirty blood dirty blood she felt dizzy and sick lily remembered once in first year when theodore nott a seventh year slytherin had called her a filthy mudblood because she had asked for directions to the transfiguration classroom that was when she met august and she had told lily exactly what the foul term had meant it a foul term that old purebloods use august had stated at the age of eleven it means that you have dirty or tainted blood most wizards dontthink that anymore but there are some who think that they are above everyone else leave me alone lily choked on the words get the hell away from me gladly brent smirked we only started dating for one reason and after today i wontbe bound to it any longer brent whipped around and walked towards the door lily picked up her butterbeer bottle and threw it at him the bottle shattered against the wall because lily aim was horrible the ravenclaw turned around to catch a glimpse at the redhead the pub had grown eerily quiet and all eyes were boring into either lily or brent get out lily shouted so loudly that she thought her throat was going to rip into two i hate you brent only laughed cruelly as he ambled out of the pub and slammed the door shut behind him lily gave out a dry sob and sunk into the cozy booth drawing her knees up to her chest she buried her face into her legs the redhead felt someone sit down next to her and place a comforting arm around her shoulders she was pulled close to a body in a loving embrace he was a jerk anyways sirius voice whispered you deserve better lily pulled away wiping the back of her hand over her eyes sirius sat next to her and james sat across from them lily wanted to scream in frustration for potter to see her the way she was but she didnthave the energy or the heart to do it at that moment instead she simply told him look i only have a couple minutes to make an utter fool out of myself but you have your whole damn life so just shut up and leave me alone i didntsay anything james protested not now prongs sirius warned him lemme go lily said as she pushed sirius away from her i have to get out of here sirius stood up and let lily stumble past him she ran towards the front door of the three broomsticks and burst through the doors the gryffindor adjusted her clothing around her body to become warm again lily leaned up against the brick wall of the pub and sighed heavily he not worth it lily told herself he a bloody jerk the door to the pub opened again and james potter walked out he looked at lily briefly before leaning up against the wall next to her the boy looked as though he wanted to say something but lily didntwant to talk to him james leaned in towards her as if she kiss her on the cheek only lily ducked leave me alone potter lily said as she took a hand and pushed it into the side of the teenage boy i not in the mood for you and your jackass comments and actions i dontunderstand why you just wontgive me a chance james sulked because you re nothing but a bullying toerag and i cantstand the way you strut around the castle as if you own the sodding place you ve got quite a mouth on you james pointed out as he adjusted his glasses and i dont strut it called walking evans in case you haventnoticed it this newfangled idea where you place one foot in front of the other in order to get places see that what i talking about the redhead shouted you always have to poke fun of people or hex them as they walk by i cantstand it i ve seen you in the hallways you randomly point your wand at people and hurt them without even thinking about the person you re hurting how would you like it if snape hexed you every time you walked by him snape does it all the time to me so i do it back he replied we just dontget along so you hurt each other real mature lily rolled her eyes gosh boys are such idiots lily walked away from james and into the street of hogsmeade she was just about to go find someone she could actually talk to without getting horribly frustrated when she heard something the wind muffled the noise so lily had to strain her ears in order to hear what the sound was she heard it again only clearer this time people were screaming at the top of their lungs the redhead stood frozen in the middle of the street as students came dashing towards her tears were running down their ghastly pale faces it was then that adults started strolling up the path with billowing black cloaks and white masks covering their faces lily had never seen anything like it the masked figures held their wands up and shot spells at the students several fell down to the ground as they were hit and other screamed in pain lily the redhead turned her head to the direction she heard her name being called brent paddock came running towards her with a wand in hand there was a look of malice shining in his eyes he drew his wand up and pointed it at the gryffindor his mouth moved and a ray of light shot out of his wand it collided with lily chest and she fell back in intense pain it felt as though her body was being ripped apart from the inside out the pain was overwhelming she couldntsee due to the tears running down her face everything was so blurry lily a familiar voice shouted frantically a blurry james potter came into view through the tears lily could see he was pallid and scared his hands touched her stomach and the pain worsened the redhead cried out for him to stop but only an incoherent shriek escaped her lips james pulled his hand away immediately lily felt the boy pick her up into his arms and the pain increased again jets of light were flying everywhere the redhead slung one arm over james shoulder and the other hung limply he turned and ran out of the street and towards a shop lily didntexactly know what was going on because her whole mind was numb due to the pain i about to do something highly illegal and dangerous but wait to yell at me until later kay james asked but didntwait for an answer lily suddenly felt oddly strange it felt like her whole body was being sucked through a tight hole her chest was tight and her face felt like it was going to concave in her head seemed it was going to implode and then there was nothing her whole world had gone black she could no longer hear nor see anything it was comforting due to the fact that there was no more numb pain the next time lily opened her eyes she was in the infirmary at hogwarts the room was spinning and voices were talking she couldntmake out what was being said but she knew that the headmaster was there his voice was calming but at the same time unnerving it was atypical but lily tried not to think about it miss evans the headmaster voice was clear now are you okay lily started to shake her head no but immediately stopped when a sharp pain shot up through her neck she felt terrible there was a sharp pain in her chest and stomach her head hurt and her ears were ringing she was tired and just wanted to be left alone she didntfeel like talking or explain anything she didntwant to even think about what had transpired at hogsmeade earlier would you care to explain what you saw damn lily swore in her head as the headmaster chuckled did he just hear her pushing those thoughts far from her mind lily opened her mouth only to find that a sharp pain shot through her jaw pain was so annoying and well painful the redhead knew she was keeping dumbledore waiting but she didntfeel up to answering she supposed she had to though we were attacked lily hated how her voice sounded it was all scratchy and hoarse the headmaster handed her a goblet of water and told her to drink that was easier said then done her neck and jaw throbbed as she lifted her head to tip the contents in her mouth then when the redhead swallowed the water burned all the way down her esophagus perhaps it wasnteven water at all lily didntknow nor did she care the gryffindor sighed in frustration as she leaned back on her pillows in pain do you know who attacked you the headmaster asked kindly as mcgonagall and flitwick came into view i dontknow lily lied as her voice started to sound a little more normal and the ringing became faint mr potter said it was brent paddock of ravenclaw the headmaster said with a frown can you concur that lily closed her eyes and groaned in her head of course potter wanted to get paddock expelled why did she care though paddock was a jerk who broke up with her and then found it fitting to hit her with some stupid curse where potter had to take care of her if she didntwant to die stupid ravenclaws maybe lily replied as she opened her eyes yes why do you suppose that mr paddock took it upon himself to curse you while the village was under attack because we just broke up lily questioned herself i dontknow if you re trying to ask me if he was with those blokes with the masks i cantanswer you because i dontknow he didnthave a mask on or anything oh by the way who were those men they call themselves death eaters miss evans death eaters death eaters lily heart sank they worked for that dark lord who was coming into power oh that was really fitting everyone was so uptight about this lord voldymelts and now he attacked the village she could hear rhia and august now they would tell her how she shouldntcrack stupid jokes and take life so loosely argh so they work for lord voldymelts lily inquired to make sure her memory served her right mcgonagall and flitwick looked like they swallowed their tongues their eyes were wide and they were as pale as pale could be what had she done wrong the headmaster chuckled with a smile upon his face and his eyes twinkled the old man reached a wrinkled hand out and gently patted lily messy curls his name is voldemort dumbledore commented with his smile still intact though i do like your adaptation of voldymelts oh lily said as she blushed i didntknow i was saying it wrong i only heard it once and well there no need to explain dumbledore chuckled again as he held up his hand misses cromwell and diefendorf as well as mister lupin are outside having a fit over you they are very anxious to see you misters black and potter are currently harassing poor madam pomfrey on your condition should i allow them entry or do you want to sleep lily wanted to say sleep but guilt stopped her from doing so her friends were probably really worried about her and it was unfair to make them wait until tomorrow to talk to her it was weird to hear potter was out there waiting for her as well what did he care if she lived or died he saved your life so probably did it to get attention do you honestly think he d risk his own neck just for attention he could have died made it all the more worth wild didntit people are probably calling him a hero and he as happy as happy can be with all the attention he receiving if that was the case then why is he outside with your friends asking about how you are doing damn lily hated when that little voice outsmarted her the redhead told the headmaster to let her friends in the three professors walked out of the hospital wing two girls and three boys came rushing inside rhia was the first at her bed and she sat down on the edge of the bed carefully the others lingered directly behind her i dontknow whether to cry with happiness that you re alive or kill you for making me worry so much rhia whispered i ll take the former of the two lily whispered back you have to stop doing this august told her yeah rhia agreed first the whole thing with gorgeous tights and now the whole hogsmeade thing i think i grew a couple gray hairs you ll look cute with gray hairs lily commented look at remy he pretty cute with his lily forced a smile in remus direction he smiled shyly back sirius and james both laughed though james was a little forced rhia told her all about what happened at hogsmeade death eaters had stormed the place and started attacking students only two had died and a shopkeeper had passed as well there were about ten students rushed to st mungo and several were brought to the infirmary no one knows why the death eaters attacked but it seemed like they wanted something in the village for not that much damage was done after an hour of chatting madam pomfrey shooed everyone out saying that lily needed to regain her strength the redhead was grateful since she just wanted to close her eyes and sleep forever no one would ever really know what had happened at hogsmeade that day it was on that day however that students starting turning against each other lily would never trust anyone ever again in fear of being hurt the people that she was already close to would slowly start to drift apart the ones that lily was only acquainted with would start to be the ones who would be there when she needed a shoulder five years from now lily evans potter would reflect on how she grew so far apart from rhia and august in the next couple of years she would also reflect that she was happy that she grew closer to remus sirius and eventually james she would hold her son in her arms and wish for the darkness to be gone for she didntwant him to live through the trials she had to author notes this took longer than i expected but i couldntget the chapter like i wanted it i still didn t but i thought i might as well post it for i ll never get it the way i want i so self conscious now on how i write my characters someone from a different site had left an anonymous review about this story saying it was a good plot but i write the characters horribly i hope i dontwrite them horrible i actually liked how i portrayed them please take the time to review because you did take the time to read it it the nice thing to do the following reviewers have messages at my livejournal darkdestiney2000 lxlriotgirlx megaroony elspeth renee and sarcastic spastic thanks for the reviews to everyone else who just told me they enjoyed the story chapter summary their lives so beautiful so hectic so lovely would be torn apart it would be swallowed in and spat out in the nastiest way possible then again not everything that is right can last forever there would not be light without darkness there would not be life without death there would not be good without evil in time when the war was over the surviving friends would look back on life and finally feel free chapter title hunt the prefects major hbp spoilers has there ever been a time when you stepped back and thought that your best friend had passed the creepy stage and into just plain insanity if not then you are defiantly not friends with a one rhiannon cromwell her definition of fun is jumping out of dark corners while throwing hexes at innocent people to prove that girls are better than boys usually i dontlike the fact that some people i e whose name is james potter attack other people for no good reason but i had to admit the competition was interesting to say the least by hiding in dark corners waiting to attack prefects you can learn things about someone that you never thought you d find out thus i came in contact with someone journal a journal very much like mine but the content so drastically different i would be horrified to find out that someone had read my journal but when you encounter someone else journal you canthelp but want to read to experience and to get to know how did i come in contact with a certain someone journal that would forever change my view on them well it all has to do with my best friend experiencing a stint of temporary insanity you want to what sirius black asked with a smirk dancing on his face lily stared at her best friend as though she grew two heads sure rhia had come up with some pretty stupid ideas but everyone has like the time in third year when rhia wanted to see if laxatives would work on cats so they gave a few to filch pet cat let just say that the cat didntlive long after that we could get expelled for this august protested that only if we re caught rhia retorted what you want to do isntnormal lily stated define normal lily narrowed her emerald eyes at her friend she turned towards remus to see if he was going to protest he glanced nervously from james and sirius to rhia it was then that lily realized it how could she be so stupid remus never spoke out against anyone in fear that they would reject him because of his illness come on poppet sirius whined you know you want to these are my fellow pupils my fellow prefects she exclaimed i not going to go around and and play hunt the prefects hunt the prefects poppet you now gave the game a name lily growled in frustration sometimes she just wanted to slap sirius he was so immature at times that it was painful lily suspected that the dumb innocent act was all for show she d seen the look of pain in his eyes she witnessed how he had put on a mask to hide his true feelings let get started james announced as he clapped his hands together we have to wait until dark potter lily snapped we have to go to dinner wait feisty you said we were going to meet at midnight by then the prefects would already be in sirius spoke you idiot that why i talking to you now so that we can meet earlier replied rhia you didnthave any idea what we were doing until today did you rhia chose to ignore sirius she explained in detail how everything was to be done no invisibility cloaks or charms could be used during the competition to which lily added no transfigurations either while she pointedly looked from sirius to james to peter the plot of the game was to find the prefects patrolling and hit them with minor hexes such as disarming confundus or disarming charm the game would last two hours and the group to get the prefects the most wins as the day passed by and the patrol inched closer lily felt a knot form in the pit of her stomach she had just found out who would be patrolling that night severus snape and bellatrix black were to patrol the upper part of the castle while leo northumberland and guinevere haswell were to patrol the lower part of the castle this was going to be messy the marauders and the mirages met in the entranceway of the school with their wands at the ready as soon as the clock indicated it was past curfew the game then began the marauders seemed all too eager to go upstairs lily knew it was because severus snape was up there with her lips pursed waited several minutes before she trailed behind them august and rhia decided to go down to the dungeons the redhead meandered after the marauders peter and remus branched off to the right while sirius and james took a left lily looked both ways before deciding to follow black and potter for they were most likely going to be more entertaining to watch they walked and talked for several minutes until they heard someone coming towards them they went off to the side and hid lily went to the same side and hid from both sets of people lily saw the boy she was dreading to see his long greasy hair hung in his face a book was clenched in one hand and the other was writing something down his hooked nose brushed up against the paper every couple of seconds lily leaned her body forward slightly to see a tip of a wand peek out from behind the statue where the two most popular boys in school hid aguamenti a male voice whispered as a jet of water came squirting out of the wand snape who was oblivious to everything around him stepped into the rapidly growing puddle his foot slid forward causing him to fall backwards with a loud thump the book in his hands splashed into the puddle the slytherin wand tumbled out of his pocket and washed down in the water his head turned from side to side looking for the culprit immobulus a different male voice whispered it was then that sirius and james came out of their hiding place sirius stuck out his foot and planted it down upon snape wand he rolled his foot towards him bent down and picked up the wand meanwhile james gaze was resting upon the drenched book in the big puddle the two friends created chronicles of the half blood prince james read oy padfoot look at this snivellus has a diary let me see sirius stated as he reached over to grab the book from his friend grasp no james snapped as he pulled the book closer to him give me the pleasure of reading it to you let see snivellus darkest secrets or should i say prince snivellus prince sirius snorted you think you re special or something snivellus it was early in the morning when mother and i had set out to spinner end to see my ailing grandmother james read she hadntbeen fairing well and it was the first time that mother could get away without father knowing that she was leaving the house mother although reluctantly agreed to take me with her by the time we got there grandmother was gone mr donovan said that she was rushed to the hospital since grandmother chose to live in an all muggle neighborhood for what she called peace and quiet there was no way to know what muggle hospital grandmother was rushed to defeated mother and i went back home to see father drunk and sitting in the great room with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth saying he was furious that my mother left without permission would be an understatement i will never forget how he advanced on my mother as though by an invisible hook james potter was flipped upside down into the air the journal splashed down into the puddle not waiting to see what would happen not wanting to know what sirius and james were going to do next lily pointed her wand at the journal and whispered accio with the book clenched in her hands lily stealthily got away from the three students as quickly as possible lily concluded that she had never been so nervous in her life her heart pounded oddly in her chest as she made her way towards the dungeons to find august and rhia she took the stairs two at a time as she raced down the maze of staircases lily ran down on flight of stairs and forgot about the missing step her leg fell through and lily nearly dropped her wand and the journal without thinking lily sat the two objects onto the nearest step so that she could have both hands free to hoist herself up breathing heavily she grabbed her wand and the journal and raced down the stairs once more she heard giggling that sounded oddly like her best friend but lily couldntbe certain she crept around the corner to peer down the stairwell that led to the dungeons to see the back of a girl head the black hair defiantly belonged to rhiannon cromwell the boy was clearly leo northumberland the two were sucking face and touching each other very inappropriately lily adverted her eyes away from the two she didntparticularly want to watch the two snogging for she had no one to snog in her life deciding to gain herself a point in the hunt the prefects game lily conjured a small flock of birds the birds hovered above her head she then pointed her wand discreetly at leo and muttered oppugno the birds then soared towards leo and rhia and started pecking leo hair leo flung his hands over his head but the birds wouldntlet up he resorted to running down the corridors while yelling rhia looked abashed as she watched the prefect scamper off it was then that lily decided to stroll out and make her presence known one for lily evans she said smugly you just didn t rhia exclaimed as she whipped around did you see i was getting some oh please lily scoffed you make it sound like you two were getting ready to bang well i wouldntknow since you rudely interrupted us with your stupid birds rhia shouted if you damaged his face i ll damage yours you can say they are battle scars battle scars are always sexy you re so a dork lily rhia commented with her voice laced with annoyance oh you know me lily spoke nonchalantly i embrace my total dork in myself because life is too short to be cool i ll just damage james potter scrumptious face rhia spoke with arrogance lacing her words go ahead lily challenged maybe you ll actually make him less of a prat by ruining his face the best friends smiled at each other before they both burst out laughing it was one of those random moments when you couldnthold in a snicker it was a moment when you didntknow why you were laughing in the first place there could be a small gesture a look across a room of people or a small trinket that would make something click in the mind and cause best friends to burst out in a fit of giggles it was a laugh that only best friends shared and those kinds of laughs were always the best of them all lily ran in one direction while rhia ran into the other lily who was still laughing for no apparent reason clenched her side in pain as she sprinted down the corridors looking for a new prefect to attack she then remembered the small journal resting peacefully in her jacket pocket lily stopped and pulled out the small hardback book the cover looked like green marble with a black binding it was wrong to read private thoughts if someone ever read lily s the embarrassment would be enough to kill her journals were kept to reveal the darkest of secrets and the deepest of desires they werentmeant to be read by curious peers or snooping parents but yet lily evans couldnthelp the temptation to read words directly from the heart reaching a shaky hand out lily carefully pulled back the cover of the book as though she half expected it to explode chronicles of the half blood prince was etched in a small messy scrawl underneath the small title read deciphering the world of 1975 lily could feel her heart pound in her chest and her mind screaming to not go any farther her mind went back to what james potter had read not twenty minutes ago the words gripped her heart and made it ache with a longing severus snape had always been a mystery he was the awkward boy who had became the primary target of the marauders since the first day of school he was the boy who never washed his hair and whose nose was constantly made fun of he was the boy who walked jerkily with his head down he was the boy who was a genius in potions he was the boy that nothing was known about besides the fact that he was in slytherin lily saw it as a chance to get to know someone she knew nothing about she saw it as an opportunity to seek the information that would unravel the anonymity that was severus snape lily reached out an elegant finger to turn the page to the first journal entry as though someone where going to jump out from a corner she cautiously looked both ways before reading january 9 1975 a day that i would like to forget a day that should be forever blown off the pages of the yearly calendars has arrived at last i canthelp but think if today were not my birthday if today were merely a regular day like any other my mother wouldntbe in the position that she is i like to believe that my father wouldntbe a drunk an abuser a rapist nevertheless it was the fates that allowed such a day to be the fates allowed tobias snape and eileen prince to come together for years of neglect and abuse as i sit in the cold stonewalls that is slytherin common room with avery making obscure gestures i cannot help but wonder why my mother has sent me a journal for my birthday i cannot fathom why a book of all things would come in useful for me with only a twelve word note that read to help you remember between what is right and what is wrong i try to fathom how a book would help me make sense of the rights and wrongs of the universe there are whispers of a new grindelwald approaching some fear to speak his name and mark him as the dark lord i have been contacted by several slytherin alumni that this dark lord is searching for loyal followers to reward them with their greatest desires i look at those such as avery bellatrix black rodolphus and even black younger brother regulus deem it as their mission in life to join i look unto those people who are merely fourteen fifteen and one even thirteen and wonder what their greatest desires are what are they willing to do to get what they want is this what my mother was speaking of is this my colossal right and wrong assessment at the age of fifteen and in my fourth year at hogwarts i am faced with a decision that will be the best decision of my life or the greatest mistake i will ever face what are you doing lily jumped slightly slamming her finger in the book she let out a hiss of pain and turned around to see august and remus standing behind her lily slipped the journal into her pocket and stuck her injured finger into her mouth she scrunched up her face as a reply before she strolled up towards them lily withdrew her finger briefly to say none of your business how many prefects you get august asked oh you know me fifteen or sixteen lily said indifferently so what zero then hey i ll have you know that i got one that leo kid with the fun last name she protested whatever replied august how many you get we each got two remus answered as a blush crept his face lily was about to say something when she heard footsteps approaching them fast she was just about to turn around to see who was coming when someone jumped onto her back nearing making her fall over somehow she kept her balance as strong arms wrapped themselves around her neck and legs trying to coil around her waist there was only one person who would attack her from behind and that person was sirius black how much do you weigh lily wheezed as her back started to burn from the weight a thousand pounds sirius huffed as he let go of lily she stood up and moved her neck from side to side to crack it her back ached and felt odd sirius stood next to her and propped an arm on her shoulder i ll have you know i only about 160 ish that almost fifty pounds more than me lily protested what were you thinking i canteven carry rhia and she only ten pounds more than me how much exactly do you weigh sirius inquired you prat you dontgo around asking girls what they weigh you started this conversation you jumped on me like a bat out of hell sorry if i thought we were great friends who would take piggy back rides on each other that sick sirius lily replied as she stepped away from him get your mind out from under the cloak sirius whined lily looked around at the small group to notice that peter and rhia were not present the image of rhia and leo snogging filled her mind as a rat peter sat idly on leo shoulder watching their every move she shivered slightly hoping that nobody actually saw her do so it was then that rhia came strolling towards the group from the right and peter from the left lily thought for a fleeting second that she was psychic before she dismissed the idea the small group made their way back to gryffindor tower sirius and james skipped all the way there singing songs at the top of their lungs the rest of the group tried several times to get them to stop but it didntseem to help lily knew it was a matter of time before a teacher caught them as though on cue mcgonagall appeared in her nightgown with a scowl placed on her face what is going on black and potter snuck out of the common room so remus and i went to apprehend them lily stated very professionally and mister pettigrew and misses cromwell and diefendorf are out why back up lily said with a wave of the hand dontworry professor they ve been properly dealt with i ll take your word for it miss evans lily smiled sweetly before marching forward the small group followed her obediently mcgonagall wasntone for letting wrongdoers go so easily then again all the teachers seemed to respect lily evans they all seemed to like her there was really nobody who had ever disliked lily except for her snobbish sister petunia it seemed as though the students looked up to her or respected her to an extent even though brent paddock tried to kill her he was impressed by her for it wasnteveryday that mudbloods strive at magic or at least in his eyes so as the unusual group walked back to gryffindor common room they didntutter one word to each other it wasntneeded at all they didntknow it now but their lives that seemed so perfect would be destroyed lily evans and james potter would die for their son in six years time sirius black would be sentenced to azkaban for life remus lupin would live years of seclusion while only coming out to catch glimpses of little harry potter on privet drive peter pettigrew would live as a rat and wait out his time until he could rejoin the darkest of dark lords august diefendorf would move to germany with her grandparents and live a life of regret rhiannon cromwell would move to ireland meet a muggle man and start a life that would never feel right their lives so beautiful so hectic so lovely would be torn apart it would be swallowed in andspat out in the nastiest way possible then again not everything that is right can last forever there would not be light without darkness there would not be life without death there would not be good without evil in time when the war was over the surviving friends would look back on life and finally feel free rhia august and remus would be the ones to survive through it all and when the war ends they will be oddly content they will feel at peace with the world author notes it has been a month from today that i

pronouncing those kind of words i never thought you could be so quirky quirky lily turned to face him who uses words like quirky apparently i do sirius replied i have a proposition for you apparently i dontwant to hear it chapter 2 first day a drag i really easy to get along with once people learn to worship me okay so i lied about the last part of that statement but i am easy to get along with i proved that last night for remus lupin and i got along famously i knew if i were to befriend a marauder then i would befriend remus it just a known fact sirius black is too egocentric james potter is a pompous prat peter pettigrew well he is just a mousy boy who was terrified of his own shadow lily rhia called from somewhere in the dormitory first day of classes fabulous lily muttered as her pen scratched on the pages of her journal joyous classes i cantwait until i have potions and herbology so i can royally flunk out of school and officially suck at life i afraid that i will get dreadful on both of those o w l s i absolutely horrendous at those subjects charms is my best subject and all time favorite defense against the dark arts is another one i adore enormously arithmomancy astronomy transfiguration and care of magical creatures are tolerable classes i enjoy them as well lily rhia called in a singsong voice let get going sometimes best friends can be so aggravating as if she actually cared about getting to class on time oh wait sirius black yes let go to class early to get good seats so we can watch black and potter make jackasses out of themselves that sounds like a marvelous idea why didnti think of that first silly me i being serious lily we need to eat and then get to class rhia whined we arentgoing to have enough time scary little yes my best friend is super scary she canthelp it she doesntlike to take the medication the doctor prescribed i coming lily who had already been dressed an hour ago slipped her journal under her mattress and emerged from behind her curtains she saw rhia standing by the door with her arms crossed over her chest and her book bag draped over her right shoulder she had a perturbed look on her face the redhead waved enthusiastically before walking leisurely towards the door oh i forgot before lily could finished her sentence and walk further back into the room rhia had grabbed the pale girl by the wrist and practically dragged her out of the dormitory the two friends made their way down the long hallways and the changing stairs until they reached the giant dining hall august was already up and eating at the table with no it couldntbe remus lupin the two were talking and laughing as if they were the oldest of friends how why was it so easy for them look who i dragged out from behind the dustbins rhia greeted august good to see you hadntreally lapsed into a coma august joked har har lily took a seat next to remus since rhia had already placed herself next to august i was actually up before all of you in what wacky dimension august asked with a smile playing on her lips lily opened her mouth to retort but before she could a hand slipped over her mouth the redhead twisted to see who was behind her but the hand kept her from moving too much to see therefore lily did what she always did she stuck out her tongue and immediately the hand jerked back the prefect smiled in accomplishment before turning around to see sirius black standing behind her her victory smile instantly fell oh it you lily turned back to her breakfast yeah and you know what the dark haired boy sat down next to the redhead i like you i like you a lot actually i think you re absolutely fabulous really a side of lily evans i ve never seen i dontknow what your problem is black but i bet it really hard to pronounce lily words were laced with sarcasm maybe madam pomfrey can help you out i hear she really good at pronouncing those kind of words i never thought you could be so quirky quirky lily turned to face him who uses words like quirky apparently i do sirius replied i have a proposition for you apparently i dontwant to hear it i think we should become friends sirius picked up a piece of bacon and shoved it into his mouth i think it would benefit us both no think about it sirius whined in an awfully annoying way we could be the next plato and herman excuse me who are they people i just made up on the top of my head to make us sound utterly amazing the boy had a platinum smile stretched upon his face i ve seen you set aside a special time to publicly humiliate yourself lily abandoned her breakfast and made her way out of the great hall it was before long that she noticed sirius black walking at her side creepy little she sped up her pace but the boy only did the same what did he want from her a kidney lily turned to the left hoping that black would somehow not see her so he would keep going straight no such luck listen black i noticing how you re validating my inherent mistrust of strangers i not a stranger evans we ve went to this school since we were both wee little first years go away lily stressed i dontlike you i think you re a horrid person i try to be nice but you only try to be mean now now lily sirius pulled a tight smile onto his face there no need to be rude i not being rude you re just being insignificant you do know that half of your comments have nothing to do with the conversation right sirius leaned up against the wall you re the most infuriating person i ve ever talked to thanks but i ve already heard that one seeing as my mother tells me that all the time sirius spoke bitterly lily faltered at this it was mrs black who had hollered at her son and tried to kill him with extremely sharp fingernails just yesterday was lily really being compared to a woman who obviously didntlove her son i need to get to class lily sighed what class sirius wiggled his eyebrows in an awfully disturbing way i oh crap she didntget her timetable i dontknow exactly i can help you out seeing as we have the mostly the same classes sirius whipped out his timetable from his back pocket potions with the enchanting professor truax first thing this delightful morning kill me now and spare me the humiliation i wouldntdo that sirius smirked i would merely just stab you with a fork watch you bleed and then save you you actually sound pretty reasonable lily smiled at the boy i think it maybe time to up my medication argh sirius grabbed his heart with a pained expression on his face that cut me deep yes lily walked to potions with sirius black yes they made small banter all the way there yes lily enjoyed the boy company yes lily could actually see herself being friends with black yes lily had actually called him sirius once while they were walking down the stairs to the dungeons yes lily thought the boy was absolutely hilarious no lily didntwant into sirius black pants the two parted their ways when they reached the potions classroom the redhead took her usual seat in the back of the room to the left side sirius went over to the back row on the right side to sit next to peter pettigrew who was already in the room it was about five minutes later that everyone else started filing in the room rhia and august sat on either side of lily you left rhia whispered with sirius yes i was talking to him lily replied as her eyes wandered over towards the marauders maybe they werentso bad lily had always thought sirius was the instigator of the group the worst one of them all if she could feel completely comfortable with black then maybe they just tried to portray the imagine of a bad boy maybe they were really nice guys who liked long walks on the beach and cute puppies and were really never mind sirius black had just hurled a blue spell towards severus snape as soon as the greasy haired prefect entered the room snape stumbled as he foamed at the mouth it looked as though he had rabies or something he then started jerking from side to side as if he lost all the functions in his body everyone was laughing except remus august and lily the redhead stood up and strolled over towards the marauders she was so livid she could feel the heat burn her face her wand was drawn and clenched at her side her right hand flung up making her wand point directly into the mirthful face of sirius black stop it she shouted stop what lily sirius asked calmly you re hurting him lily nodded her head in the direction of the slytherin prefect it all in good fun my dear oh this made lily flare expelliarmus lily had bellowed the spell with such force that it knocked the cocky sirius black out of his chair and onto the floor the spell on snape immediately stopped making the boy fall to the ground the girl population of the class had stopped laughing and gasped the male portion excluding the marauders laughed even harder how dare you james potter raised himself out of his chair and stared at lily how dare you ask me that question lily replied coolly i had every right it okay james sirius stood up and turned towards lily with a scowl on his face someday we ll look back on this laugh nervously and then change the subject you re a right git black lily looked at him disgusted before walking back to her seat the doors towards the side of the classroom burst opened revealing a tall thin man strolling into the room his black hair was clear down to his elbows but was tied back loosely his black eyes were piercing and menacing he wore slytherin green robes his movements were commanding but refined the man held several books under his right arm as he sauntered towards his desk who can tell me what the polyjuice potion is professor truax dark eyes scanned the crowd snape get off of the floor several students raised their hands mainly all slytherins august had raised her hand confidently into the air however as she always did in all of her classes it was as if professor truax had simply scanned over august for the briefest moment before calling on the disheveled severus snape it a potion that allows the drinker to take the appearance of anyone they choose for an hour that is if they have a piece of said person hair snape voice was laced with detestation with his eyes narrowed though it lasts for only one hour the drinker can drink more of the potion to essentially keep in the other person appearance forever provided that they have enough of the potion in supply and enough of the person hair ten points to slytherin truax gave away the points in a lazy monotonous tone lily at this point wanted to doze off but didn t instead she took out a piece of parchment from her bag and simply wrote you want to be each other for a couple hours partner then the redhead slid it over towards rhia whom immediately read it lily watched out of the corner of her eye the huge smile the spread across the dark haired beauty you will be your partner for one hour in about a month professor truax waved his wand at the blackboard behind him these are the ingredients get potion making you know lillian i ve always wanted to drink your hair rhia smiled brightly oh rhiannon i ve always wanted to drink all of you lily smirked let us put our magical powers to work so that next month we may cause pandemonium rhia lily whined you know my powers can only be used for good come to the dark side lily evans rhia spoke in a mysterious voice we have cookies no no not the cookies donttempt me with such evil entities august had teamed up with fellow fifth year gryffindor allyson calhoun she was a short chestnut haired girl she had a slight stomach with huge brown eyes james potter had of course partnered with sirius black remus lupin had teamed up with peter pettigrew slimy snape oops severus snape had teamed up with rodolphus lestrange all the partner groups were simply predicable since they were the same groups every time okay so we need some fluxweed knotgrass horn of a bicorn and skin of a boomslang rhia read off the first set of ingredients well first we should start lacewing flies lily was so rudely interrupted at this point we dontneed those a protesting rhia exclaimed second column lily replied oh rhia blushed slightly but quickly smiled those need to be stewed for twenty one days do i look like kelly watson over there lily nodded towards the blonde ditzy gryffindor talking to an enraged looking sirius black well the red hair is dead giveaway that you cant be her rhia spoke thoughtfully if you dye it blonde then you could so be her for this rhia was smacked in the back of the head with a pale head the dark haired girl looked at her best friend with a pained look dancing on her smiling face it was rhia who then said your sympathy towards me is so overwhelming the two girls laughed as they started to stew the flies which was a disgusting task within itself it wasntbefore long that the bell rang to indicate class was over hurrah lily quickly loaded her bag and rhia bag as rhia put away the potion supplies august lily and rhia then made their way out of the dreary dungeons and up to the bright side of the castle it was time for dun dun dun charms it was by far lily favorite class how much joy a simple class brought joy to the redhead heart they reached the classroom to see professor flitwick working on something at his desk he was writing feverishly on a piece of parchment with a somber look on his small face lily had never seen the man look so serious in her life where was the joyful and jolly professor flitwick that she knew and loved lily august and rhia took their usual seats in the front of the class it wasntbefore long that the rowdy groups of marauders strolled into the classroom except wait they werentloud at all they were whispering to each other plotting something yes that had to be it hold on lily could hear what they were saying so she eavesdropped who would even say such a thing sirius tone of voice was laced with anger and tenderness probably just some jealous girl you turned down james replied empathetically the whole school believes it james sirius still spoke in hushed tones now everyone probably thinks i sex crazed who didntthink you were sex crazed before james joked but there are certain people here who can take that literally and tell my mother sirius suddenly seemed slightly frightened bellatrix and regulus they ll tell her that i got two girls pregnant when i didn t oh no lily stomach sank who in the world told people that rhia no rhia would never let that get out she fancies black too much rhia would never let anything negative about him leak out what if someone overheard her joking around kelly kelly watson she was one for gossip oh merlin she must have been awake lily mind went wild everyone here professor flitwick asked without even looking up good today we will be learning about the fidelius charm who can tell me what that is professor flitwick folded the parchment he was writing on and held it with his left hand with his right hand the short professor ignited that parchment with blue flames he then turned towards the fifth year gryffindors and ravenclaws with a smile playing on his face guinevere haswell the ravenclaw prefect raised her hand into the air miss haswell professor flitwick called on her fidelius deprived from the latin form fidelis which means faithful friends charm fundamentally protects a person or object by hiding it from every except for the secret keeper and whom the secret keeper deems fit on trusting excellent miss haswell fifteen points to ravenclaw i d like to hide sirius black rhia leaned over and whispered to lily if you know what i mean too much information rhia the class seemed to have passed all too quickly for lily before she knew it the bell had rung students were filing out from all directions it was the mellifluous voice of the charms professor that made the redheaded prefect falter in her journey to lunch lily doubled back towards the professor desk once everyone was out the professor smiled brightly at lily each head of house is allowed to nominate two students for the prefect position from each house a boy and girl the jolly professor spoke with a sparkle in his eyes lily already knew what he was going to tell her he had nominated her for prefect joyous just when lily was considering running away with him ha no lily was just entertaining herself i voted for you as did every other head of house it seemed as though professor dumbledore got a right chuckle out of it the little man laughed there was really no doubt who would be the female gryffindor prefect thank you for suggesting me professor but you really shouldnthave lily spoke honestly august is so much more smarter then me you were the one who had scored all o s on the final exams lily the professor spoke seriously miss diefendorf had received all but two o s on her finals you re very impressive professor there no way i could have done that lily sighed i mean i absolutely horrendous at potions and herbology i couldntmake a correct potion to save my life your test results speak differently miss evans you have a lot of talent i may have plenty of talent but quite frankly professor i just dontgive a damn that no attitude to have lily professor flitwick sounded both flabbergasted and disappointed here how it is professor lily took a deep sigh i never going to make a difference in the world i going to go through life and when i die no one will ever remember i existed no one will even care that i walked this ground i ll just be another face and name in the zillions before me do you have any idea what you are suggesting yes i do professor well miss evans i have to say that i will always cherish the initial misconceptions i had about you professor flitwick talked with an almost thwarted tone i thought you were a girl of such potency and power a girl who would fight in this emerging war and come out on top now i canthelp but think you re just an asinine girl who doesntgive a damn about anything you may leave now miss evans lily felt her chest clench as she walked out of the classroom with tears burning in her eyes professor flitwick hated her her favorite professor thought she was nothing but a juvenile who didntknow anything what she spoke was true however in her mind she wouldntbe remembered when she died she couldntdo anything spectacular to make herself be remembered lily found herself unable to eat lunch now therefore she did what she usually did when she was upset she walked around the tall towers of the castle on the balconies to feel the wind nip her face she raced there as fast as she could she wrenched open the huge door to the balcony and walked out the redhead felt the tears fall down her face why was this affecting her so much why did she care what people thought of her she walked towards the stone railing and propped her elbows upon it she leaned slightly forward and watched some students eat their lunch by the lake others were walking around or playing with their friends lily felt so alone may i inquire what is wrong lily jumped slightly as she turned to see the graying headmaster next to her where did he come from it was as if he just appeared out of nowhere sometimes that old man could be extremely creepy his aging face turned towards the youthful girl with a quizzical look on his face i was just chatting with professor flitwick lily sniffed as she tried to hide her tearstained face excuse my rudeness but why do you look ever so upset about it he told me all the heads voted for my appointment of prefect lily murmured well that nothing to be upset about i must say i was quite entertained that all of the teachers seem to love you professor dumbledore smiled in a case of a tie i am the one to make the final decision i have to say that i ve had to make the decision in every single case this year except for the female fifth year gryffindor and the head boy position who was it between in the gryffindor male category off the record of course miss evans but it was between remus lupin and james potter it seemed as though professor sprout and professor truax elected mr lupin while professor flitwick and professor mcgonagall elected mr potter lily was puzzled at this why would anyone in their right mind nominate james potter as prefect he was just so narcissistic and generally bad professor mcgonagall seemed to loathe the boy for he was always causing troubles why would she of all people vote for him did you pick remus so that i wouldntthrow myself off the astronomy tower lily asked with a smile on her face lemon drop the headmaster offered her a candy as she took one i must say that i picked mr lupin for the fact that i believe he could exercise some control over misters black and potter oh so it wasntthe fact that i would slaughter myself if i had to spend over a minute alone with potter this seemed to have made the headmaster chuckle you are ever so entertaining miss evans i try my best lily replied i never want you to believe you never will make a difference miss evans wait what how did the headmaster know what was said earlier in the charms classroom does he have little spies or something all over the castle so that he knows everything that happens within the stone walls on the other hand maybe he was just a really good guesser what could i do to make a difference asked lily you d be surprised to find out all the power you behold lily didntsay anything at this she was actually at a loss for words professor dumbledore seemed to have noticed her hesitation and decided to leave her alone with her thoughts why was it that everyone just tries to confuse me lily thought the redhead started to walk around the veranda thoughts filling her head why was it that two professors thought she was extraordinary what was it about her nothing that she could even begin to comprehend yes that was it no that wasnteven an answer you have strength argh what was this sneak up on lily evans day and scare the life out of her lily turned to see the divination teacher standing there she had a long dress on with a thick shawl the professor didntlook like fortunetellers in the muggle world but actually like she could be the real thing she had graying blonde hair that was tied loosely back in a bun excuse me lily asked you are very powerful miss evans the professor went on you may not realize it but professor dumbledore and i keep a close eye on those in this school to pick out the exceptional ones the ones that can fight in this coming war what war lily was irritated by now the darkest of dark lords is now approaching the woman explained he is emerging to cleanse the wizarding world so that it fits his image of what he thinks it ought to be like what is his image to rid the world of all the muggles and muggleborns lily face drew pale at this there was someone actually out there who wanted to murder a whole bunch of people was he the wizard equivalent to hitler just the thought of that made lily skin crawl then again didnthitler have syphilis did this new dark lord have a disease that made him mad you will face him miss evans more then once you will defy him thrice before the end ex excuse me lily backed away no no i won t miss evans lily ran she ran as fast as she could to get as far away from the astronomy tower as possible she wasntgoing to face some maniac that was for sure she skipped every other stair on the staircase she just wanted to get away it was when she got off the stairway and turned right that she collided with another person umph a male voice made that sound as lily landed on top of him sorry lily breathed heavily so sorry she touched the boy chest and hoisted herself up lily got a glimpse at the boy she fell on no it couldntbe the prefect nearly fell down on him again but luckily she kept herself up brent paddock her crush she fell on the boy she liked so much for falling head over heels i so sorry brent lily scrambled up s okay brent propped himself up on his elbows lily isntit lily evans he knew her name oh joys yes that me lily smiled the clumsy redhead lily evans also known as gryffindor prefect lily evans brent smiled oh he had gorgeous teeth you re brent paddock the prefect that i am but unfortunately i paid my way into the prefect position the boy joked oh the boy was funny he could crack a joke and mock himself that was wonderful lily liked him even more already he was absolutely scrumptious in rhia words i ll be seeing you lily evans brent picked himself up from the stone floor yes at the next prefect meeting lily said as she was now longing for the next prefect meeting next monday then or maybe before brent smiled as he walked away lily sighed as all of her troubles seemed to slip away oh the joys of boys yes most of the time lily thought all boys were immature and pricks but brent wasn t he was different he was the ideal boy lily thought that she might just be falling in love with him it wouldntbe until months later that lily saw the true side of brent paddock he would be the first boy she ever gave herself to it wouldntbe until much later that she realized that professor dumbledore and the divination professor were keeping a much closer eye on the students then she thought it wouldntbe until months later that lily realized the extent of evil one person could hold lily wouldntthink too much about the rising dark lord until she came face to face with him it would be years later that lily would understand that she was just as powerful as professors flitwick and dumbledore made her out to be that first day of classes she didntknow it at the time but there would be a time where she would stop doubting herself all the time and become confident at everything she did she didntknow it yet but she would be forgotten when she died just like she thought she didn t however know that she would be a war hero at her death author notes yay good or bad review and tell me if you like it or not if you do what do you like if you don t what do you propose i change give me suggestions so that i can make this a story you all like chapter title detention desires chapter summary ah but you see dearest poppet filch who was supposed to be supervising us never said we could leave therefore we could get in trouble for not being at our detention i honestly dontthink mcgonagall can take sarcasm very easily nor do i think that mcgonagall takes jokes of suicide easily either all i know is that mcgonagall and dumbledore caught us red handed out after curfew jumping off a tower and being in possession of a pink bunny a blue mouse and a green kitten i didntget my prefect position taken away however i got a month worth of detentions with black and potter and fifty points off gryffindor oh and most likely a letter sent to my parents here sort of how it unfolded out after curfew attacking prefects making ice rinks attempting suicide i would have expected this from black and potter but you miss evans mcgonagall rambled you are a prefect you are to set an example to the younger students and this example you are setting is inexcusable we werentattempting suicide per say lily stated black and potter wanted to know how mary poppins could fly excuse me it a muggle thing lily smiled i was so happy that two purebloods took interest in the story that i oh for merlin sake mcgonagall exasperated albus lily eyes snapped over to the headmaster who had been oddly quiet throughout everything dumbledore and mcgonagall found the three students as they made their way back to gryffindor tower they were immediately taken to the headmaster office since then mcgonagall yelled in utter disbelief of what happened madam pomfrey entered to heal lily elbow which still ached from the fall now the three sat across from the headmaster and watched their head of house pace around the room was it a prank he asked no potter spoke up did you mean to be caught no was it an act of rebellion no dumbledore folded his hands onto his desk and leaned forward his eyes wandered from sirius to potter and finally to lily who sat awkwardly next to sirius his eyes didntleave her for some odd reason she felt uncomfortable miss evans what were you three doing out so late on the astronomy tower lily hesitated rhia remus august and peter were all involved too and she couldntrat them out an excuse that what she needed and fast a fast easy simple no questions asked excuse it was a dare lily decided on saying a dare dumbledore questioned as his eyebrows rose slightly yes to go all mary poppins and fly with only an umbrella albus mcgonagall warned as she looked at him with a sideways glance seeing as professor mcgonagall is your head of house i think it is only fitting for her to punish you in any ways she sees fit you will not be expelled nor will you lose your prefect badge miss evans lily left out a breath that she didnteven know she was holding a hand suddenly touched her arm she looked over to see sirius giving her a smile she would have been murdered if she lost her position on the prefect board her parents would have grounded her for the rest of her life a month worth of detention and fifty points off gryffindor each mcgonagall announced each sirius interrupted would you like to make it a hundred each off to bed now i want no detours and no more trouble lily made sure her green kitten was secure in her arms before walking out of the headmaster office with the two boys and their new pets behind her they walked in silence until they approached the fat lady james poked her to wake up and proceeded to mumble the password out so late it nearly one in the morning lily pushed her way through the boys and went into the common room rhia august remus and a sleeping peter were situated around the fireplace rhia head was resting on remus shoulder with her eyes drooping august immediately jumped up from her spot next to remus and ran over towards lily wrapping her in a hug month detention and 150 points off gryffindor sirius announced as he plopped down next to peter do you still have your prefect position asked remus just barely she replied as she sat down next to remus who won tie august spoke up remus and i jumped off together see poppet jumping off together wasnta bad idea now was it sirius smiled at least i got kermit after all of this lily indicated the small green kitten in her hands well my mouse can keep wormtail company sirius announced as he plopped the blue mouse into peter pocket what the bloody hell am i going to do with a pink bunny james asked feisty what with the multicolored animals just something for fun she replied sleepily that and she ran out of ideas august said with a smirk i have a red puppy i want the dog sirius whined lily smiled to herself as she rested her head down onto remus free shoulder closing her eyes she listened to sirius fighting with august about wanting a dog saying that it would fit his personality to the tee before lily knew it she was off in dreamland where she had perhaps one of the weirdest dreams in her life drake townsend and james potter were in tights they had huge hats on their heads with feathers sticking out of them with swords in hand they dueled each other while lily watched from the sideline with sirius and an array of rainbow colored animals the next day lily woke up with a stiff neck from sleeping onto remus all the marauders and mirages were lounged around the room lily quietly got up and tip toed towards sirius she knelt down and gently grabbed his wrist turning the wrist up right lily noted that it was only a little pass five in the morning deciding it was fruitless to attempt to go back to bed she changed silently into jeans and a t shirt grabbing a sweater off her trunk lily slipped it over her head and started down towards breakfast fully knowing that she would most likely be the only person down there once arriving lily noted that drake townsend was up and working on homework while eating professors flitwick and truax were chatting in low tones with a book laid out in front of them lily had a decision to make right then and there sit by herself or go over accept drake invitation and sit with him deciding that the latter didntsound so horrendous lily walked over towards drake and sat down next to him good morning she greeted morning he smiled i didntknow you got up this early this is a record for me lily smiled back as she reached out and grabbed a small piece of a pumpkin pasty glancing sideways at drake she half expected him to say something instead he ate a bagel and read his arithmancy book what your number asked lily to break the silence seven you oh six lily replied as she tapped her nails onto the table i was thinking about what the first weekend in march is a hogsmeade weekend and i vaguely remember you asking me to go with you if you still want to go i d like to go with you if i even still allowed to go why wouldntyou be allowed to go i sure you ve heard of the thing with potter and black no enlighten me i sorta jumped off the astronomy tower with them with only an umbrella i never pictured you as a magical nanny type lily laughed not knowing how to reply she waited for him to say something else except that he didn t they sat in comfortable silence for nearly an hour before more people started piling into the great hall she turned to drake and quietly told him she d see him later the last thing she wanted was for sirius to see them together and start on his insults and disapprovals walking towards the gryffindor table she sat down next to sirius have fun talking to the wallflower sirius smirked looked like neither of you were very open sod off sirius testy sirius smirked even wider i hear our detention is to clean the trophy case without magic and only a toothbrush joys beyond joys it going to take us more than a month to complete that bully for the trophies why are you in since a sour mood because i have detention all night with you and potter but that a good two hours with your favorite men in the whole world the day passed slowly as the detention was drawing nearer something jolted in lily stomach at the thought of what lay before her after dinner that night mcgonagall told her she was to clean the trophy room without magic from seven until nine it would be that way once a week she would share the detention with black and potter in the past whenever she did something worthy of detention it was simply lines for about an hour this was massive this was horrid five before seven lily made her way to the trophy corridor she saw filch standing there with three buckets of water and three dingy looking cloths the caretaker looked up at her briefly before mumbling something under his breath that lily couldntquite catch her shoes squeaked on the floors as she made her way towards filch i here for my where are the others err coming as though on key the two boys came running down the hallways with peeves following them screeching something awful covering her ears she watched as filch started to chase peeves down the corridor the boys laughed and gave each other high fives sirius was the first to go towards lily with a smile on his face hey poppet look what prongs and i pulled off convinced peeves to distract filch for us and we donthave to do our detention just sit here until we hear footsteps brill isntit lily chose not to reply she certainly wasntgoing to be caught not doing her detention she wanted it over with as fast as she could grabbing a cloth and a trophy lily started to wash and polish the thing the nerve of the boys they were caught and they couldnteven hold up their part of the detention i noticed you stopped going to patronus lessons potter commented as he pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket it was fruitless for me to go she replied as she picked up a trophy that belonged to james father i quit too sirius spoke up as he took a long drag of the cigarette why do you smoke those things lily asked forgetting about cleaning it disgusting and makes you smell horrid plus they re muggle inventions so why would pureblooded wizards want them relieves stress sirius smirked these are a wizards brand anyways james added plus we like to look french so stereotypical of you lily sighed so you drink and smoke let me guess you have tattoos too anything that fits the teenage rebellion profile you must be apart of actually potter smirked sirius recently just got a tattoo last christmas i have failed to acquire one yet but it does look promising lemme see it lily forgot all about her detention no sirius replied as he sent an angry look at his best friend why it on my arse liar potter muttered with a smile you re a bloody git prongs lily walked casually towards sirius and sat down beside him she smiled at him and looked at his forearms there were no tattoos she leaned back to look at his neck but didntsee any there either she slanted forward and looked at the small piece of chest exposed but there was nothing there as well she turned to potter and asked where is it shoulder right take off your shirt lily commanded take off yours first sirius replied bitterly why wontyou show me is it something about me maybe a lily with heart petals or perhaps just a picture of my face sirius rolled his eyes before he started to unbutton his white dress shirt once half way down he shrugged the fabric off his right shoulder to be bare lily leaned back to take a look there were two animals there a stag and a dog the dog was laying with its head resting on the front legs as the stag laid next to it underneath it were words written in a fancy script brothers by heart prongs and padfoot reaching a hand forward she gently ran a finger along the stag and then the dog sirius and james were brothers in every sense of the word they finished each other sentences and knew what the other were thinking by just a simple glance they told each other everything and spent the holidays together they became animagus together attended detention together and even started the same habits together i like it lily whispered why didntyou want to show me it because it was personal too personal for me to see i guess lily stood up slightly hurt and not knowing why so what if sirius didntwant to show her some stupid tattoo so what if she wasnta close enough friend to show something like that to she certainly didntcare about it let him be that way she wasntgoing to show that he hurt her shocked her made her feel just a little bit out of the loop the group you are out of the loop a small voice reminded her you re just lily you re not a marauder lily grabbed the nearest trophy and started to polish it with the dirty rag so what if their friendship meant nothing to him it not like she depended on him for anything the detention passed awkwardly black and potter smoked joked laughed and of course were asses lily polished the trophies and refused to speak to either boy who tried countless amounts of times to draw her attention away from her pointless task filch didntreturn nor did anyone check up on them they could have been destroying the castle and no one cared the three walked back to gryffindor tower together lily smelled like lemon soap and evergreen cleaner which collided horribly with her flower perfume surprisingly enough neither boy commented on it halfway back sirius and james stopped suddenly and whispered for lily to join them reluctantly and against her better judgment she walked back towards them wha sirius clapped a hand over her mouth and dragged her into the nearest room potter shut and cast a locking charm on the door utterly baffled and wanting answers lily bite sirius hand causing him to jolt back with a slight gasp he looked oddly at her but before he could say anything lily said what was that all about prefects were coming potter replied and you knew that how i smelled them sirius spoke up you smelled them lily looked at him dubiously let just say that ever since i became an animagus my dog side has become more intense that the most ridiculous thing i ve ever heard of in my life then go out get caught and have more detentions we were going back after our detention therefore they cannot punish us now this they could punish us for because we arentgoing directly back to our common room ah but you see dearest poppet filch who was supposed to be supervising us never said we could leave therefore we could get in trouble for not being at our detention then let go back to the trophy cases no the boys said together in a very eerie creepy way lily groaned she looked around the room to see it was yet another abandoned classroom that no one ever used except in this room the furniture was covered in huge dusty clothes pulling one off lily saw it was some sort of antique cabinet with carved drawers walking across the room she pulled off another cloth to reveal a huge mirror she looked into it and felt her blood boil get away potter potter was standing behind her in the mirror his hand snaked around her and touched her not so flat stomach wait that wasntlily it looked like her but older and very obviously pregnant she tore her eyes away from the mirror and looked down at herself james hand wasntthere and her stomach was flat she looked up again to see her normal self with potter standing behind her i didntdo anything i wasnteven by you when you yelled at me get away lily whispered the mirror it it james rolled his eyes and walked away towards sirius lily looked at the mirror again to see something slightly different she was still very much pregnant and james was still behind her except there was a small girl with red hair in his arms and a slightly older boy with messy black hair sitting on the ground playing with something james leaned forward and placed a kiss on his check lily reached up to touch her check and swore she felt a tingling sensation turning around with her hand still on her check she sought out the two boys who were sitting on a very old table she wanted to ask them about the mirror but not tell them what she saw was it a mirror showing nightmares no you know it wasnt you were happy to see james with you and to have children with him i dontlike potter why are you denying it he fun to be around he a joker he gorgeous he a great friend he generally a good guy just because he likes to pull some pranks on slytherins doesntmean anything he cruel evil and vile he struts around like he owns the place he thinks he better than everyone else i hate him perhaps you say you hate him because you re ashamed to love him lily are you okay sirius snapped her out of her mental battle with herself fine she whispered so softly she wasnteven sure what she said obviously you re not you re as white as a ghost she wasntin love with james no potter his name was potter she wasntin love with potter she didntsecretly want to shag him and have baby potters she didn t she swore she didn t then why did she see it in the mirror why did she suddenly doubt everything potter was a jerk she didntgo for jerks paddock was a jerk damn why d that voice always have to be right look in that mirror tell me what you see she commanded sirius he laughed softly before obeying the smile on his face quickly disappeared once he looked into the mirror his head snapped towards lily with confusion written on his face he slowly turned back lily watched as his adam apple jiggled from swallowing what d you see pads potter asked with concern laced with his words something that will never be he replied bitterly sirius moodily walked away from the mirror and stormed out of the room he slammed the door shut on his way out lily and james were left in the room neither knew what to say so nothing was said instead james walked towards the mirror and looked at it his brow furrowed slightly before a look of enlightenment crossed his face he looked up at the phrase above the mirror which made no sense it shows you what you must desire james stated it cantbecause what i saw isntwhat i most wanted well i sorry to break it to you evans but apparently you dontknow yourself as well as you thought what d you see myself in auror robes with you by my side you looked hot evans i think this is a sign of finding this let go out and make this a reality you re a jerk what d you see none of your business i told you what i saw i only think it fair for you to tell me what you saw i mean come on we are going to be married shut up god you disgust me lily too stormed out of the room making a point to slam the door shut behind her lily stormed down the hallway the door opened and potter yelled go out with me evans just once without turning around lily shot her right arm back and made a rude gesture while shouting piss off she quickened her pace and honestly didntcare about anything at that moment the audacity the boy had was outrageous how arrogant ignorant and absolutely gor absolutely idiotic the boy was gosh she was not in love with potter in the next couple of years lily would be best friends with denial she would yell deny and attempt to deflate james potter ego at ever turn behind closed doors however she would be daydreaming about the boy and wishing that he would just get out of her mind she would date other boys but in the back of her mind they would always be compared to the tall lean messy haired quidditch player that all the girls seemed to swoon over author notes this chapter was horrible to write i simply just couldntget it right no matter how hard i tried i know i usually have review replies up right away but right now i having such a horrible night that i dontthink i could possibly put any thought into them whatsoever i will have them up on my group by the weekend sorry for the delay on posting and replies i didntreread it whatsoever and i wrote the closing paragraph tonight so i sorry if it horrible because of my sour mood anyways please leave a review they will certainly cheer me up i hope to have the next chapter a lot sooner where lily first date with drake will take place chapter summary i guess james potter is an angry person eh yeah angry people just need some hugs or really sharp objects lily replied he obsessed with you you know that right i know and i wish he wasn t i dontunderstand i nothing special you re beautiful smart and witty you have an exceptional personality you have a strong will it was now lily turn to interrupt you really do wonders for my ego pretty soon i ll be the biggest supercilious person known to history chapter 3 brent paddock have you ever been so high on bliss that it seemed as though you were on a cloud that would never fall oh if you haven t then you haventmet brent paddock he makes you feel so exceptional and lovely inside just the way that he said he would see me at the next prefect meeting made the rest of my day so enjoyable he always says that to me now ever since september 2nd every day he would it now saturday morning the first weekend yay to the thousand i meeting brent today by the lake he wants to hang out today and get to know each other my fantasy since third year is finally coming true can life get any better better yet nothing can bring me down lily closed her journal with a content smile on her face she put journal under her pillow and emerged from her bed to see rhia flipping through a magazine august was lounging around reading a book kelly watson was doing what kelly watson did best writing long notes about all the gossip in the school allyson calhoun was doing homework well when everyone else doesnthave a life lily does that a first hurrah where are you going red rhia voice spoke i meeting up with brent lily replied lazily paddock allyson looked up with a dreamy look in her eyes he so cute is he your boyfriend kelly looked up from her note writing to see if there was new scandal to spread around the school you know what kelly maybe you should keep your nose out of everyone business lily forced a smile onto her face that was a really nasty rumor you started about sirius black having kids you know you were the one who told cromwell over there i was joking watson dontyou know a joke when you hear one it was so horrible what happened after that rumor started spreading around school it was two days after the rumor had originated when all hell broke loose in the great hall during breakfast pass the syrup johnny bunny rhia leaned over towards her younger brother get it yourself arsewhip tsk tsk you know if mother knew you were using such coarse language johnny she would well you know rhia smirked widely even in a public place the two siblings were still bickering and calling each other names it reminded lily of petunia and her relationship they often acted just that way that was when lily turned eleven beforehand the two got along famously post a second year cried in overexcitement hundreds of owls flocked in the great hall and went to their masters they dropped packages and letters sirius black who was sitting not to far away from the girls had received a scarlet letter the boy turned pale and looked panicked it was then that the letter had exploded and all eyes were on sirius you disgraceful scoundrel a shrill female voice shouted getting two girls pregnant have you no shame you have ruined the black name i do hope those girls are from respectable pureblooded families because if they arentyou will wish you were never born you imbecile one more toe out of line and you will be coming straight home under lock and key the letter then ripped itself up and piled itself upon sirius breakfast the boy looked livid every student and teacher eyes were on sirius black several students started to snicker at the humiliation of one of the most popular boys at hogwarts sirius let go james potter stood up and grabbed his best friend arm and then whispered so that only a few could hear him we can skive off class i ll get the firewhiskey sirius whispered as he stood you get the cigs sirius then stormed out of the great hall and as soon as he left the whole dining hall burst out in laughter james looked around disgusted before he too stormed out of the dining hall it was still your fault evans kelly spoke in icy tones lily who felt extremely bad about how everything turned out walked out of the dormitory and made her way towards the lake brent would understand and make her feel better she knew it lily stepped out into the brisk september air and looked around the lake for the scrumptious ravenclaw she saw him sitting there all by himself with a book opened on the grass lily felt like a little kid and she impulsively ran towards brent brent lily fell down on the grass next to him hey lily brent smiled widely i found you lily spoke as if she had won a game i won but i wanted to win the ravenclaw whined slightly maybe next time the redhead smiled it was then that brent leaned forward and kissed lily tenderly on the lips she was being kissed this was her first kiss was she doing it right she didntknow what to do how far do you open your mouth how long do you stay like this do you before another insecure thought could fill her mind a yellow spell came hurdling towards them brent bit lily bottom lip and she could taste blood in her mouth the two pulled back just as brent was hit with a spell that made him fly backwards lily looked as he twisted his face in pain she turned to where the spell was emitted no the bastard james potter was standing there with his wand out stop it lily cried as she crawled over towards brent you dontknow what he capable of james shouted as he walked closer to the two prefects stay away stay the hell away lily stood up and drew her wand lily i dontwant to see you get hurt he bad news no he not you re the one that bad news if i bad news then you re a liar james shouted back i hate you lily mustered the most serious voice she could no you don t i hate you lily yelled so loud that she thought her throat would burst open james stumbled back slightly at the harsh tones lily was speaking in sure she had said those same exact words before but never that callously and sincerely the redhead face was beat red and there were tears burning her eyes she didntdare let them fall though she didntwant james potter of all people get the best of her she would never let him see her cry you re my everything james spoke softly and i just cantstand back and watch him hurt you well you re nothing to me for now on when you think of me just remember that i could have been the best thing you ever had i highly doubt that lily jaw clenched you re a jerk and that all you ll ever amount to now if you excuse me brent needs help lily pointed her wand at brent and levitated him up in the air she then took him as quickly as she could to the hospital wing she walked in to see madam pomfrey reading a newspaper she immediately looked up when lily had called out her name what happened was there an attack madam pomfrey was frantic as she motioned for brent to be put on a bed potter james potter attacked him lily spoke anxiously potter pomfrey looked confused as she ran her wand over brent i would have never imagined him to go dark dark lily questioned he was just jealous that brent kissed me three hours sitting in the hospital wing was not fun not fun at all it was quite tedious and extremely depressing lily had learned from madam pomfrey that brent would be okay and the spell that hit him wasnteven that bad of a one she also learned that professors mcgonagall and dumbledore had given potter a month worth of detentions for attacking a fellow student they even took off all the points gryffindor had acquired in the short week of school lily lily turned her head towards where her voice was called brent was up and smiling at her how could one person make her feel so good the redhead smiled widely and sat down on the corner of his bed she didntknow what to say but she didnthave to say anything for brent talked first i guess james potter is an angry person eh yeah angry people just need some hugs or really sharp objects lily replied he obsessed with you you know that right i know and i wish he wasn t i dontunderstand i nothing special you re beautiful smart and witty you have an exceptional personality you have a strong will it was now lily turn to interrupt you really do wonders for my ego pretty soon i ll be the biggest supercilious person known to history somehow i doubt that whatever is said to you penetrates you it was then that madam pomfrey came wandering into the infirmary the woman shooed lily out stating that brent had needed his rest what was a redhead to do then if not wait in the hospital wing well she could go to the astronomy tower and clear her mind but no she couldntfor there would be the crazy professors attempting to stalk her she could talk to professor flitwick about the latest charm featured in charmed chronicles magazine but the tiny charms professor was too disappointed in her she was just about to find a hole to crawl in and die when rhia came into her view the dark haired girl had her arms crossed over her chest in a bored fashion no words were exchanged when rhia grabbed her best friend arm and dragged her off they two walked around the corridors of the castle until they reached the main entrance rhia pulled lily outside and they walked towards the quidditch pitch where were they going it was then that lily saw where her best friend was taking her they hid behind a tree so that they could see two dark haired boys smoking and drinking secretly behind the quidditch lockers black and potter were actually smoking and drinking did they want to die young or something lily was about to go out and yell at them when rhia held her back listen the girl whispered forcefully a fucking month of detention god prongs why the bloody hell did you attack him anyways he a paddock padfoot what was i supposed to do kelly was saying how lily fancies him and i couldntlet her fall for him evans isntyour concern james black sounded almost furious if evans wants to go and get herself killed then that her choice she a muggleborn sirius potter replied she doesntunderstand who his family is she doesntunderstand what they represent she too fucking trusting for her own sodding good rhia grabbed lily arm and dragged her away from the two boys they walked with their arms linked around the lake to a spot where no one else was around it was then that rhia started talking in a very serious tone it kind of scared lily to hear the weightiness of her best friend voice who was rarely ever serious the paddocks are an old wizarding family like mine like james and sirius families some old families have old ideals like brent and sirius s others could care less like james and mine you ve heard of the dark lord emerging haventyou why is every being so cryptic about this guy oooh the dark lord i shaking in my knickers lily snorted this isnta time for one of your jokes lily this is a serious matter it shouldntbe dunked thick in sarcasm sarcasm is just one of the many services i offer lily if this is so serious then tell me what this guy name is lily no tell me come on people dontspeak his name lily because if you speak his name then it said you re his next victim gobbledygook this isnta joking matter for once in your life cantyou just be serious rhia exasperated yeah well it kind of hard to take this serious when i dontknow what the hell is going on lily with her redheaded fiery stormed off towards the castle she didntsee the big idea about this wizard as if anyone could be more powerful then professor dumbledore the headmaster would never let anything happen to his students lily wasnteven going to care about this so called darkest dark lord until she found out who he was if he didnteven go by a real name then how bad could he be wouldntit be funny if his real name were oliver clothesoff or something equally ridiculous like that lily made her way to the library to research for her charms essay that was to be written on the fidelius charm as if that would ever be useful in life lily thought she knew that if you used the charm you would have to trust the person completely but nobody would keep that secret if his or her life was at stake she grabbed several of the most complex charm books and found herself a table to sit and research mind if i sit remus lupin sat a stack of books double the stack of lily down on the table go ahead remy lily smirked potions or charms remus opened a book called restricted potions of the dark arts charms lily replied with a smile polyjuice just seems like a really easy potion to do an essay on there are a lot of variables that you can talk about in your essay like what lily looked into the amber orbs of the prefect well what if you take a hair from a person who can change their appearance do you change into their original image or into the image they are changed into to or do you change with that person under the influence of the potion you mean like one of those metamorphous people they are so cool if i was one i d get rid of my freckles that have invaded my nose and cheeks remus laughed as he seemed to be counting her freckles on her face once you got remus lupin to open up and talk to you he was a really pleasant person to hold a conversation with what it like being a prefect gah where do these people come from is it sneak up on lily and scare the crap out of her month argh it was a first year ickle first years were so irritating did they actually care what it was like to be a prefect or did this kid just want to impress his friends by talking to an older girl it would be so typical really if it were the latter of the two well remus and i pretend to work and they pretend to pay us really the kid seemed not to have understood what lily had just said no actually it a thankless job but i got to build up my karma level karma level the boy asked in wonderment just do something so very bad at the end of your forth year and you wontever have to worry about becoming prefect the first year boy walked away and practically jogged to his group of friends sometimes lily wished that she could be a little kid again they didnthave a care in the world when you were a teenager you have crazy hormones you re so encouraging lily remus was smiling brightly i know i canthelp it lily face grew serious do you know anything about this dark lord lily didnteven know why she cared so much about this wizard it not like he would affect her life at least she hoped not there was a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach about it though it was twisting inside and eating away at her yeah he apparently gathering followers to get rid of muggleborns are you a pureblood no half actually my dad a muggleborn do you know this guy name i know the name he goes by but not his birth name remus seemed extremely uncomfortable with the subject what is it lily pushed lord voldemort the boy whispered and lily seriously doubted that she heard anything at all it took lily a couple seconds before she burst out laughing everyone in the library turned to watch the eccentric prefect chortle some burst out laughing with her as laughter was very contagious it was then that madam pince came over with a piercing glare it was as if there was chocolate in the library or something out she shrilled you are disturbing the learning environment remus and lily grabbed their bags and books they then scampered out of the library as soon as the library doors were closed behind them they both burst out laughing lily had dropped her books all over the floor and fell over with them remus leaned up against the wall and chuckled with amusement what what so fun funny remus asked between chortles lord lord vol voldymelts lily rolled over onto her back as tears of joy poured down her face who would call themselves that remus had stopped laughing and stared at the hysteria that was lily evans it seemed as though the boy didntknow what to make of the redhead he had never realized just how free spirited and entertaining lily was until now how she could take the most serious situation and still be able to make people laugh apparently that guy remus said with a smile this made lily burst out in a fit of giggles her pale face was slowly turning the color of her hair it was quite an amusing sight to watch the fifteen year old not have a care in the world it was reassuring in a scene remy promise me we can always joke about him and not make him into a big thing lily reached out a hand for the boy to help her up he did so and the two found themselves closer then they had ever been they could feel each other breath dancing on their faces and necks it was almost intoxicating tuesday we patrol lily pulled back yeah remus replied with a slight smile i should probably take these books up and write my essays lily started gathering up her books since i have no life and all i donteither remus sat his own books down and started to help lily collect hers up hey we ll never have voldymelts work his way into a conversation of ours unless it to royally make a mockery of him thanks lily smiled brightly before walking off why was life so complicated at every turn why couldntfeelings just be easy she thought she loved brent but remus gave her the same feeling then what were james potter and sirius black talking about while they drank and smoked it up then rhiannon cromwell had warned her as well how did you know the difference between good families and bad families how could you tell the difference between purebloods half bloods and muggleborns why was it so important for purebloods to know other blood it didntmake any sense to lily nothing ever seemed to make since to the redhead maybe she was just so na ve that nothing she couldntdiscern what certain things meant on the other hand maybe she just didntwant to understand the wizarding world because she was so used to the muggle world whichever it was it was tremendously annoying lily wasntgoing to get anywhere with her essays so she figured why try there really wasntany point to just stare blankly at a piece of parchment when your mind was on something totally different the redhead reached under her pillow and grasped her beloved journal i never thought much about a person linage it seems to be really important in the wizarding world some people take things all too seriously i mean if the world was going to end there was really nothing that could be done fate is fate and destiny is destiny if i were to die tomorrow then who says that it supposed to stop who rules this crazy little thing i call life who pulls the strings who controls us well i suppose this a very awful thing for me to be writing since i christian if my mother ever found out well let just say that she would hang me like in the olden days it was very hard for my mother to grasp the idea that i was a witch but she was proud that i was special nevertheless lily closed her journal with a slight new outlook on life she wasntgoing to let some thick wizard rule her life so what if this lord voldymelts wanted to kill all muggleborns she wasntgoing to die at the hands of him no she had made up her mind she was stronger then that she was incredibly stronger then that oh lily evans a female voice said in an annoying tone oh joys kelly watson did she find it incapable to leave lily alone well if kelly wanted a fight she d get one lily pulled opened her curtains surrounding her bed and stuck her head out in a singsong voice lily said oh kelly watson what ever would you like there seems to be rumors lily that you were caught kissing brent who me said lily putting on a shocked face that cantbe right i just wander from room to room lily dontbe annoying kelly well you cantstop being a daft so why should i stop being annoying lily shot back have you ever tried being nicer have you ever tried being less dim kelly looked as if she wanted to asphyxiate the living daylights out of lily but this only made the prefect smirk this made kelly flare even more the girl looked about ready to strike the redhead kelly opened her mouth and uttered the words what so funny oh i just trying to visualize you with a personality merlin lily you re just so irritating thanks lily said icily i ll take that as a compliment the girl stormed out of the dormitory to leave lily alone the redhead flopped down onto her bed and smiled in accomplishment there was a secret plot forming in lily mind she wanted by the time she graduated to make kelly watson see how horrible of a person she was how gossiping and spreading rumors was mean and hurtful she also planned on getting back at james potter and sirius black and show them they were horrid people yes that was lily goal it would be until a year and a half later that lily realized she was in love with james potter it wouldntbe before long that kelly watson would meet her sticky end it wouldntbe long before that lily would realize how important blood was to some wizards and that would tear the redhead apart slowly then again nothing seemed to be on lily mind except brent paddock and remus lupin how could two boys make her go so crazy which would be the best fit for her she knew in the pit of her stomach that neither of them was right for her but a girl can dream right author notes another chapter jump for joys i hoped you liked it thanks for my beta for being super quick dontforget to leave a little something in addition you can check my live journal out and read about things to come in the story and my life the link in my profile chapter summary speaking of stalking lily turned down right only to see sirius do the same i very keen on knowing why you feel the need to stalk and harass me sirius wrapped an arm around lily shoulders as the two walked towards defense against the dark arts together it was very disturbing lily loved attention and affection but not necessarily from a boy she barely even knows i think you re rather enchanting i think you re rather annoying lily commented did i mention the kick in the groin you ll be receiving if you keep touching me chapter title scrumptious prefects in every single word that has been written in a letter there has been a buried message about a boy who loves a girl at least that what i feel when i read brent letters he makes me feel like i ve never felt before i feel so corny whenever i talk about brent because i know one day i ll look back on this and utterly hate myself for ever being so immature brent was checked out of the hospital wing this morning which was ever so good because there is a prefect meeting in twenty minutes i cantwait who to sit by brent or remus maybe i can sit by both of them if i turn my charm on ultra high how i love being a prefect lily decided that she could write the rest of her thoughts in her journal later right now however she just wanted to get to that prefect meeting the redhead stepped out from behind the curtains surrounding her bed her emerald orbs glanced across the room as a smile spread across her lips the prefect practically skipped down the stairs to the common room how perfect remus lupin in his school attire was standing by the portrait hole waiting for her his sandy hair was hanging in front of his gorgeous amber eyes his tattered clothes hung loosely on his body he looked up at the redhead and smiled widely hey lily he greeted her why hello remy lily had dubbed that remus official nickname ready to sit through an exhaustingly tiresome meeting remus asked as the two walked out of the gryffindor tower only if you are lily smiled brightly the two made small talk all the way to the prefect room it was quite sad when the two actually had to step inside for the meeting brent had saved a seat next to him for lily the redhead saw there were actually two seats open score lily motioned remus to sit down next to her which he did it was like being in heaven then in went to hell the meeting started frank longbottom went on about a lot of stuff lily was seriously suspecting that the boy just liked to hear himself talk he wasnta sore sight for eyes though several of the female prefects were watching him as if they were in a dreamy state alice prewett was one of them she was a short blonde haired sixth year gryffindor prefect it was rumored that she had a huge crush on the head boy but then again who wouldn t paris van arden she was so ever annoying like usual she wasnteven paying attention to the meeting she was too busy applying her overuse of make up onto her toasty face she might actually be pretty if she didntload her face with all that crap lily thought it was disgusting all she put on her face was some light foundation and eyeliner to bring out her eyes anything to add paris frank looked absolutely miserable to be working with her i want a christmas dance she spoke swiftly as she snapped shut her foundation case we really do need a formal event who would want to go to some prissy dance skylar devereux asked i would kaelyn salisbury the ravenclaw sixth year prefect spoke up i think it would be fun i think dances are overrated lily interjected just like school well obviously your opinion doesntcount paris leaned over onto the table since you two are just fifth years a difference of opinion doesntmake me wrong lily retorted just because two fifth years think your idea is crappy doesntmean we canthave a vote because it against yours okay let vote then the head girl seemed incredibly irritated all in favor of a christmas dance raise your hand paris was the first hand to rise in the air then others started to follow suit guinevere haswell kaelyn salisbury and alice prewett were the first to raise their hands argh and lily actually respected guinevere then oh no brent just had to raise his hand in agreement all of the seventh year prefects raised their hands which was just plain wrong even frank longbottom raised his hand in the air a couple sixth years joined in as well were these people utterly crazy well it seems like the answer is yes paris smiled smugly i not putting up decorations or anything like that the redhead leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms over her chest dontpout lily frank frank had actually told her not to pout that hurt she thought he was pretty decent you will help with the dance as will everyone else in this room can i trade this job for what behind door number one several of the prefects who wanted nothing to do with the dance snickered at lily comment remus even smiled at her this dance however faltered lily good mood a dance who would even go she didntwant to prepare it she didntwant anything to do with it gah the rest of the meeting was just talking about the patrol schedules and special duties for the christmas dance the only thing that could stop the dance from happening was if professor dumbledore vetoed the idea lily hoped that the eccentric headmaster would veto it quicker than james potter uttering a hex under his breath the meeting was over a good hour later how can a group of people talk for so long it was unnatural lily stood up and stretched when frank had officially declared the meeting over remus gathered up some papers that were handed out and placed them neatly into his tattered bag he slung it over his shoulder and waited for lily to accompany him back to the dormitory hey paris lily really couldntresist the chance to insult the head girl whatever look you were going for you missed before paris could fully understand what lily had said the redhead grabbed the pale boy by the wrist and practically dragged him out of the prefect room the two ran down the corridors until they reached the fat lady the two prefects were out of breath and that caused them to start laughing the two friends fell to the floor i i haventran so so fast since i was a a little girl lily rested her head on remus shoulders i haventran like this in forever there was a gleam in the boy amber eyes well that just scandalous lily exclaimed we ll have to do this more often we ll have to do things spur of the moment i bet you dontdo anything spur of the moment plan for tomorrow be spontaneous remus smiled widely sounds like a pretty spanking fantastic plan to me are you coming in or not the fat lady sounded pretty irritated i can only be myself i sorry that hell for you lily smiled and then spoke the password my goodness the two comrades walked into gryffindor tower into the common room it was time for partings until tomorrow tomorrow was september twentieth the day remy lupin would be spontaneous he did promise after all g night lils remus raised his right hand up lazily before it fell down to his side goodnight remy goodnight boy i like but i not going to make a big deal out of remus disappeared up in the stairs leaving lily to stand alone in the abandoned common room the redhead had so many conflicting emotions in her that she didntknow which to follow how in the world did she know who was right for her and who wasntright maybe brent and remus were both the wrong guy for her maybe it was someone she least expected lily sighed before she walked up to the girl dormitory she peaked inside to see everyone asleep or what appeared to be so lily went over to her wardrobe and pulled out her pajamas she quickly changed and settled into her comfy bed she closed her eyes and let her dreams cloud her mind lily evans lily cracked opened an eye and looked around at her surroundings her name was called again in an awfully aggravating tone rhia the redhead sat up in bed with her hair a curly mess she stepped out from behind the curtains to see a fully dressed rhiannon cromwell staring at her what time is it six bugger lily first class was at seven she d never be ready in time bugger bugger bugger the prefect flew through the room trying to assemble herself in her school attire in fifteen quick hectic minutes lily was fully clothed and somewhat presentable her hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail her tie was disheveled and her clothes were twisted on her thin frame time lily shouted 7 45 liar lily mumbled as she scrambled through her nightstand drawer for her watch 6 17 rhia sighed now come on let get down to breakfast the two girls made their way down to the great hall they practically dashed through the corridors to get to the dining hall in a record ten minutes gryffindor tower was on the very top floor while the great hall was on the first floor let just say that a lot of stairs the best friends walked in to see august sitting with the marauders what in the name of all that is holy was she doing there maybe she fancied remus they were always talking lately oh no lily froze in her tracks she couldntlike her friend boy lily wouldntgo for him no she would go for brent that it it ll all work out lily the redhead jumped back to see sirius black standing behind her grinning like a bloody idiot did he really have no life lily told black to bugger off as she walked towards the table to get a quick breakfast that no way to talk to your friend sirius retorted but i not your friend lily replied as she stabbed a fork into a pile of eggs what meant to be will always find a way sirius picked up a slice of bacon and waved it in front of lily face well what you re suggesting is that i can hope and wish for a new big sister and that will happen no because that not meant to be i think she was adopted lily whispered she not right in the head she a retard well then you fit in with her quite nicely sirius smirked because you re a retard as well i a retarded genius lily spoke in an irritated tone get it right sirius snorted slightly as he started to play with a roll he was rolling it on the table as if deciding what the next course of action was lily had to admit she knew exactly why her best friend drooled over him he was drop dead gorgeous it was all in eyes his eyes were like gray orbs to his soul they showed so much pain and knowledge it was alluring then again his hair was pretty nice too remus tells me there going to be a christmas dance his gray orbs caught her emerald orbs you have a date no it was just announced last night plus there a little over three months to go before it actually comes you know who you want to go with i hoping that a certain boy will ask me if only james potter wasnta git wait what lily snapped her head up and a look of shock crossed her face why was she thinking about going with james potter of all people no oh bugger she meant brent paddock yes brent she wanted brent to ask her sorry but i dontwant you to think i ll ask you sirius grimaced that not what i wanted you to think i not going to ask you oh gee thanks lily spoke sarcastically you really make me feel like a winner no i sorry sirius sighed so you think paddock will ask you lily glanced towards him with a condescending look etched on her face she was quite confident that brent would ask her and she was quite confident that she would say yes maybe sirius would ask rhia then remus could ask august then james potter could ask every single girl and every girl will turn him down that would be bittersweet well i dont know lily lied slightly depends on if another girl starts foaming at the mouth when she sees him there are so many pretty girls in this school he ll probably ask one of them you re pretty sirius replied but then thought better of it when he saw lily quizzical look i mean in a disgusting way oh you re so horrid thanks lily said sourly you re pretty hideous yourself thanks sirius smiled widely i glad we can sit around and joke like this it really makes my day yes and i glad you haventfound out about that drool on your pillow yet lily stood up and slung her bag over her shoulder what about the drool on my pillow sirius got up as well sometimes when you wake up in the morning the drool on your pillow isntalways yours that a very scary and creepy thought lily sirius said thoughtfully as the two walked out of the great hall i never thought you were quite this stalker ish i intrigued though please teach me your ways is there a handbook speaking of stalking lily turned down right only to see sirius do the same i very keen on knowing why you feel the need to stalk and harass me sirius wrapped an arm around lily shoulders as the two walked towards defense against the dark arts together it was very disturbing lily loved attention and affection but not necessarily from a boy she barely even knows i think you re rather enchanting i think you re rather annoying lily commented did i mention the kick in the groin you ll be receiving if you keep touching me sirius drew back his arm and let it fall limply to his side there was a smile on his face as he glanced towards the redhead the two walked in silence to the defense room on the third floor once there lily had expected them to diverge to their separate parts of the room the prefect thought wrong sirius had followed her to the left side of the room and sat down next to her please go away i allegoric to creeps lily whined slightly argh that cut me deep i not a creep sirius touched his heart i thought you were teaching me how to be a notorious stalker maybe later why was it that every time lily was late getting ready that she was always early to class ironic little everyone else soon started filing into the defense against the dark arts classroom rhia august and the marauders didntknow quite what to do when they walked in it was very unusually for them to sit together james walked over and sat on the other side of sirius with a suspicious look on his face a disappointed rhia took a seat next to her best friend august sat down next to rhia as remus sat down next to august peter sat down next to james it was a quite odd grouping professor vanderveer walked into the classroom from his office above the room his golden smile was etched on his face like usual his long mane of brown hair flowed down to his shoulders his sunken cheeks and scruffy appearance made some of the girls daydream about him he was in his late thirties the professor was an ex auror he unfortunately had to retire due to an injury to his knee on the job he was labeled a liability he did receive an honorable discharge but the professor had burned it a piece of parchment found it way in front of lily the prefect glanced over at her best friend before picking up the parchment and reading it it read do you like sirius does he like you be honest lily the redhead didntknow how to respond she grabbed a quill from her bag and wrote owe that hurts rhia i cantbelieve you would ever think that lily slid the parchment over towards rhia today class we will be learning about the most vicious curses known to wizard kind professor vanderveer surveyed the students before continuing the unforgivable curses who can name one lily looked around the room she had never heard of the unforgivable curses before she assumed they were curses that could kill because that is unforgivable other than that lily hadntthe faintest idea the redhead looked over to see a very pale james potter he looked ever so sad at this point sirius face was hard with detest miss diefendorf the imperious curse is known to control the mind of anyone who is placed under it with the incantation of imperio ten points to gryffindor professor vanderveer said aloofly miss black crucio latin for to torture causes excruciating pain to anyone it is cast on lily could hear james breathing hard he was as pale as a ghost at this point his eyes looked unfocused and cold the redhead watched as sirius placed a comforting hand on his best friend shoulder and whisper something what was going on ten points to slytherin professor vanderveer was staring at james at this point mr potter i suspect you know the last curse very well james looked up at the professor with pure hatred in shining in his eyes lily watched james reach for his wand only to have sirius stop him the professor walked towards them with a determined look on his face professor vanderveer leaned down to face the messy haired boy your father would be disgusted if he saw this was the way you were acting the professor whispered only loud enough so that lily could hear him it a disgrace to his memory avada kedavra james whispered acrimoniously what does avada kedavra do mr potter a flash of green light emits from a wand and kills the target ten points to gryffindor professor vanderveer walked back up to the front of the classroom bastard sirius spoke softly sorry i questioned you lily turned her gaze down to the note that was on her desk from rhia the rest of the class period was spent analyzing the three curses james hadntuttered a single word since the display at the beginning of the class the bell rung to indicate class was over james and sirius bolted out of the room as quickly as possible their assignment was to choose a curse and research it what was that all about lily asked as the three female friends walked down for lunch with james and vanderveer james older brother was an auror rhia explained he was murdered with avada kedavra about three years ago that horrible yeah i dontknow too much about it apparently vanderveer was involved somehow rhia reached into her bag and pulled out a box of bernie bott every flavor beans my father told me not to go near him alone so you re saying professor vanderveer is a death eater august asked death eater lily asked aghast why would anyone want to eat the dead rhia and august both looked over at lily as if they had never seen anything like her before the look lily was receiving was unnerving maybe this was one of those ask remus questions well death eaters are followers of you know who rhia said softly no i dontknow who oh right that that bloke voldymelts lily questioned lily august exclaimed in fright dontspeak lily rhia shook her head gah this is stupid no one ever listens to me until i make a mistake and then you people are all oh my lily dontsay such horrid things you re such a horrible person cantyou just shut up for once i sick of it lily whined why dontyou just never pay attention even when i say something wrong eh maybe you should read the daily prophet a little more august suggested uh august that requires money the two girls started to walk away from lily it was then that the redhead shouted not one shred of evidence supports the notion that everything in life is serious she knew that her friends heard her and that was enough for lily a hand then covered lily eyes she smiled and secretly hoped it was brent behind her she blinked her eyes several times to make her eyelashes tickle the person hand she succeeded for the hand drew back and a male chuckle was heard from behind her the redhead turned around to see brent paddock standing behind her you re ever so devilish lily smirked devilish brent questioned her dontworry about it lily waved her right hand i dontknow if i ll be able to sleep now if at first you dontsucceed destroy all evidence that you tried lily smirked anyways enough of that silliness brent waved a hand reminiscent to the motion lily made not too long ago i was thinking about this christmas ball that coming up in several months you mean the one that you re all for that one the stupid one that paris van arden suggested yes precisely brent smiled you re a very intelligent girl i know i am truly amazing i just canthelp it well i think it would be prudent if the two of us went together shocked lily dropped her jaw down it looks like brent paddock was the one after all what if you change your mind from now to then lily questioned oh i won t that why i asking you to be my date brent grasped lily hand in his next weekend is the first hogsmeade weekend and i was hoping that we could go together thump thump thump lily heart was beating so fast that it felt as though it were going to burst from her chest cavity lily go on a date she had never been on a date before this was all too bittersweet eek lily wanted to scream and dance and prance around i would love to lily tried not to make a big deal out of it when it really was i ll see you in herbology tomorrow brent leaned over and kissed the redhead on the cheek ravenclaws and gryffindors have that together i would have never guessed lily was blindsided by brent good looks that she didntsee what was right in front of her the redhead would one day hate the boy with a fiery passion for a series of mistakes he would make she would find out that you shouldnttrust people just because you know them from classes and prefect meetings some people were just plain evil she would find out that some people did the things they did with good intentions or out of anger some people were just vengeful but extremely good people lily would find out that she didntknow her best friends at all and that they were masked by fear and uncertainties there was a certain evil that was rising and it was looking for blood it was out for lily blood author notes please leave a review and tell me what you think hope you enjoyed i even posted this chapter a day early chapter summary for once cantyou just wake up early lily august whispered that way you wontbe late at least i have a optimistic outlook about my negative behavior lily replied as she placed her arithmancy book on the desk you re hopeless sometimes oh gee thanks i pick real winners as friends chapter title expecto patronus if anyone called me nosy i would have to agree with them if someone said i was impulsive well i would have to agree with that too they say curiosity killed the cat and if i were a cat i would have probably already used up almost all of my nine lives by now i like to know everything that is going on i ve always been like that it a trait of my father s daddy is a lawyer after all a good lawyer who tells the truth to help innocent people i dontknow why i so concerned about what happened with james potter family the way mcgonagall and dumbledore talked about it it was if it was the most heartbreaking thing imaginable i know i talk a lot about how i hate petunia and wish she was gone but in reality i love my sister she still my family petunia and i used to be the best of friends i miss that i miss how we used to stay up late at night and read stories i miss how we would take family vacations around europe we dontdo that anymore because petunia and i cantsee eye to eye my parents hate the bickering and fighting they hate how their daughters were torn apart i would say it was jealously on petunia part i know i d be jealous if she was a witch and i wasn t it natural i guess i just wish we could sit and talk like we used to i wish she would read me a story or we would run around outside our house to the local ice cream parlor why does this have to be so hard lily closed her journal with a frown etched upon her face she slipped the book under her pillow and emerged from behind the curtains around her bed green eyes glanced over at the clock on her nightstand bugger in five minutes she was supposed to be at a prefect meeting oh well if she was late she was late lily could really care less lily grabbed a sweater from the chair in the corner of the room and ran down the stairs there stood the wolf boy remus who was never late for anything ever was going to be late to a prefect meeting just to walk with lily oh that was a great feeling remy lily shouted as she skipped over towards her partner you re lovely to be waiting for me i d rather walk with a friend than walk by myself that one little statement made a smile spread across the redhead features the wolf boy was warming up to her increasingly the conversation the two had had the patrol after the full moon had drawn them closer she knew his secret that he tried so hard to keep therefore lily only felt obligated that she had to share a secret with him only the redhead really didnthave any secrets to share the two prefects walked together to the prefect room for their meeting they dawdled leisurely as they went they joked and laughed remus who had really only given small chuckles and smiles when they first met was now laughing fully and smiling widely it was a good feeling that lily had never experienced before the two prefects were a good twenty minutes late for the prefect meeting they walked in during one of frankie longbottom long speeches he stopped when he heard the door open sorry lily spoke softly brent was sitting in between guinevere haswell and oxford stover lily was slightly taken aback by this why wouldnthe have saved a seat for her there were two free seats next to each other by the head boy and daniel thomas lily sat down next to frank as remus took the seat next to daniel frank started talking again doing a little recap on what the gryffindor prefects had missed apparently the prefects always organized the halloween celebration they were deciding on who was making the decorations and who would put them up as well as what kind of food would be survived at the feast it was then that an idea struck the redhead like a ton of bricks oh this would be fun frankie lily interrupted the head boy who was still speaking i have an idea lily launched her thoughts to the rest of the prefects the redhead said that there was a muggle tradition on halloween to dress up in costumes she explained how people dressed up so that the evil spirits of the world wouldntbe able to recognize humans and steal their souls at least that was the story that her mother had told petunia and lily when they were younger the muggleborns in the room seemed excited they were whispering to one another with smiles on their faces the slytherins seemed extremely displeased with this turn of events except one slytherin jacqueline blaisdale the most non slytherinish person in the history of slytherin house she was a sixth year with a long locks of blonde hair her deep blue eyes danced with excitement at lily proposal we dress up in costumes with masks so no one knows whom he or she is with during the night there can be just a buffet bar where people can get food whenever they want we can take away the house tables and have just round tables instead that can seat about ten people or so at them lily spoke with excitement as she leaned forward there can be dancing and lots of candy the teachers can dress up too if they want then at the end of the night everyone will take off their masks and see who they were hanging out with the whole night kinda like a masquerade party megan gallagher a seventh year ravenclaw prefect asked exactly that way discriminations between houses wontinterfere in a night of fun discriminations between houses evans paris van arden questioned in a haughty way you canttell me that you dontnotice the chauvinism between the houses gryffindors and slytherins especially some students dontget along with the other houses at all because they have biased ideas lily explained if everyone was wearing a mask then everyone wouldntjudge others based on house because well they wouldntknow what houses everyone belongs to you just might see a side of someone that you never expected i like it frank smiled who all in for it almost everyone raised his or her hand high into the air which made lily feel like she could actually do something useful as a prefect the bad part of her whole plan was the fact that there was less than three weeks until halloween she hoped they could all pull it off she wanted it to be a halloween party not a halloween dance lily made sure she got her point across at that there could be dancing but the main focus was the partying the morning after the prefect meeting brought upon classes which meant herbology arithmancy and later that night astrology lily loved her arithmancy and astrology classes but herbology she hated that class with a fiery passion she secretly hoped she would fail the herbology o w l so she would never have to take that stupid class ever again lily got up with less than twenty minutes until class started the redhead rushed around her dormitory looking for her uniform and books ten minutes later with her hair pulled back in a messy ponytail her clothes twisted on her thin frame and her tie dangling untied around her neck she was ready to go her books papers and everything else were falling out of her satchel so she quickly piled them in i honestly dontunderstand how you can always be so late rhia commented i not late i just rushed maybe if you didntsleep in bugger off lily rhia sounded slightly offended you know what i think due to lack of interest today should just be cancelled you always say that now come on rhia and lily bolted out of gryffindor tower they had to get to the third floor and they were up on the eighth floor the girls did everything they could to get to arithmancy on time they tackled the stairs two at a time they never once stopped running when they were still officially eight minutes late they arrived in arithmancy out of breath everyone in the room looked at the best friends oddly before turning back to the professor august shot them an aggravated look the two girls smiled back apologetically and took seats next to their german friend for once cantyou just wake up early lily august whispered that way you wontbe late at least i have a optimistic outlook about my negative behavior lily replied as she placed her arithmancy book on the desk you re hopeless sometimes oh gee thanks i pick real winners as friends classes passed quickly and before lily knew it it was lunchtime the redheaded prefect wasnthungry at all despite the fact that she hadnteaten since dinner yesterday lily wanted to resolve something that had been bugging her since the beginning of the school year the prefect told her friends to go to lunch without her she dashed through the corridors in hopes of catching a certain professor before he went off to lunch lily reached the charms classroom and busted through the door professor flitwick was talking to frank longbottom about something when lily came flying through the door the two people looked at her mildly interested the redhead blushed crimson before backing up out of the classroom while saying she would wait outside until they finished outside the classroom lily banged the back of her head against the stone wall only a couple minutes passed before frank came strolling out of professor flitwick classroom you re up frank spoke with a smile dancing on his face lily walked into the classroom to see professor flitwick looking engrossed with the idea that the redhead had graced him with her presence lily walked up to the front of the room and took a seat across from the short professor he looked at her intently waiting for her to say something lily on the other hand was waiting for her professor to start after a minute or so lily finally broke the silence professor she started i came here to apologize for my behavior at the beginning of the year is that so yes i feel that i was utterly out of line speaking to you like that i must say i ve never been disappointed with you until that little debacle professor flitwick spoke calmly i never want you to think you can never accomplish something because lily you of all people can change the world there is no doubt in my mind that you won t thank you professor lily said softly for she didntdare to disagree did you see that article in charmed chronicles about the entrail expelling curse oh yes but did they really have to show those disgusting pictures it felt good to talk about the charms and hexes featured in charmed chronicles again no one else read the magazine or even cared about it the little charms professor could talk days on end about the charms featured and he often did with lily i suppose that it was efficient since i ve never cast the curse before now i know how disgusting it actually would be to see if performed in person lily laughed a smile spreading across her face she reached into her bag and pulled out the latest issue of charmed chronicles the redhead placed it in front of the eccentric professor her long fingers flipped through the pages until she came across the charm she wanted to ask about it was on page twenty two and it had a five page spread about the one charm the patronus lily declared i want to know how to conjure a patronus lily my dear the patronus is a very difficult charm to master even full grown wizards cantconjure a corporeal patronus can you yes of course i can the small professor squeaked mine isntnearly as powerful as others though can you teach me lily you haventthe use for a charm like this it looks wicked cool though lily said with a grin there were several pictures of a corporeal patronus some of them were of dogs bears eagles and even a phoenix lily wanted to know what her animal protector was maybe it could be something that was like her a kitten perhaps she loved cats they were adorable dogs were adorable as well but they were too much trouble in lily eyes i find it awfully peculiar that you are the fourth student who has asked me to aid them in casting a corporeal patronus lily stared slightly at her professor in a mixture of shock and excitement if there were other students who wanted to learn then he would most likely offer lessons why would three other students be interested in it though how many times in your life would you actually cast a patronus teach us lily asked sweetly i ll send a message around to meet me in this classroom at seven professor flitwick gave in professor you are absolutely the best teacher in this school lily said with a smile as she grabbed her magazine to stuff into her bag honestly you were always my favorite teacher but just knowing that you could give up part of your night to help us students out in extracurricular activities amazing the day seemed to pass at an excruciating slow pace lily was so excited to learn one of the most complex charms that the redhead could barely keep her excitement bottled the prefect was anxious to know which students were actually going her money was on a couple ravenclaws since they were crazy mad about schoolwork perhaps the scrumptious brent would be there learning as well that would be divine lily was betting guinevere would be there hands down really she was always looking for something new to learn crazy ravenclaws seven o clock was slowing rolling in lily got up from her seat in the gryffindor common room and piled her books into her bag august and rhia gave her a perplexed look in which lily merely smiled at the redhead ambled out of gryffindor tower with a content look on her face she could be mysterious if she wanted to too with her bag hanging on her right shoulder lily dug through the bag trying to locate a hair tie to put her hair up in once she located one the redhead showed off her multitasking skills of walking and fixing her hair at the same time lily walked into the charms classroom to see two people she least expected to be there sirius black smirked with a look of approval crossing his face james potter looked mildly shocked but pleasantly surprised to see the redhead grace her presence remus lupin didntseem fazed by the fact lily was there it was as if the boy half anticipated her to come professor flitwick clapped his tiny hands together and instructed lily to come closer he explained how he asked the boys to come early so that they could make the middle of the room bare which it was why in the world do you want to learn this charm lily asked sirius i would say that your mind wouldnthave the capacity to handle such information are you calling me dense poppet sirius inquired with eyebrows wiggling in a disturbing way maybe that cut me deep i am not dense sirius stressed it called mentally challenged get it right yes i sure it is lily sirius whined why are you smiling because it confuses people who are dense like you argh sirius touched his heart tenderly i dontthink i ll be able to sleep tonight because my feeling have been so badly charred by you i want you all to think of the happiest you have ever been professor flitwick announced as he stood on several very thick books lily turned away from sirius and thought about the happiest she had ever been well any memory with petunia in it certainly was out perhaps when lily got her hogwarts letter it thrilled her tremendously on the other hand when her father took her to a lawyer bouquet when she was ten was amazing she had been truly happy when her father danced with her and spun her around he kept calling her his emerald princess that would be the memory lily would use everyone ready professor flitwick looked at the four gryffindors lily looked at remus who seemed quite confident that he was going to produce a patronus potter looked uncertain if he had picked the right memory sirius the poor kid looked defeated it was as if the teenager couldntthink of a single good memory to conjure a patronus professor flitwick then announced to say the incantation expecto patronus while concentrating on the happy memory that was easier said then done lily uttered the spell and tried to keep her happy memory but only a puff of white smoke emitted from her wand potter got the same puff of smoke nothing came out of sirius wand remus oh smart amazing remy had gotten a mist with four legs he was just that utterly intelligent and astonishing like that remus concentrate more on your memory professor flitwick squeaked james and lily pick a happier memory you have the idea sirius i want you to really concentrate on the happiest memory you can think of easier said than done sirius muttered like i have a fantastic memory that would actually work just think of me sirius and you ll have a patronus in no time lily whispered into the boy ear sirius looked at her with one of his goofy smiles he fingered his wand in his hand as he watched her every move he watched the redhead as she tried to find another memory lily searched through her short life trying to find a happier memory when she became a witch that was certainly a happy memory it was then that professor flitwick told them to attempt it again in perfect succession the four gryffindors uttered the words expecto patronus remus wand emitting four legs and a tail this time out of james wand was simply a tail in a swirl of mist lily still had her pathetic whirly bit of smoke sirius still had nothing at least i not the worst one lily thought as she looked at her dark haired friend his features were contorted in frustration any moment now f bombs would be dropping from sirius mouth stupid fucker sirius started oy moony how the bloody hell do you do this concentrate sirius the werewolf replied simply oy poppet how the fuck do you do this sirius turned towards lily concentrate lily couldnthelp but reply with a smile do you think you re funny or something oh he was irritated it the or something that i think i am actually one two three and four more times they attempted the spell before professor flitwick called it quits lily felt like she could fall over it was as if all of her magic had been slowly drained from her body all she got out of it was a stupid wisp of silver smoke and nothing else she wanted to lie down on the classroom floor and fall asleep forever remus seemed equally as exhausted his eyes were dropping and his shoulders were slumped forward at least he was half way to conjuring a real patronus every time he tried the spell he had gotten legs and a tail in a whirl of smoke james potter seemed angry that he hadntcompleted the spell he was muttering about stupid tails as the four gryffindors left the charms room sirius black was nothing more then frustrated mad and upset all at the same time nothing had emitted from his wand at all lily wouldntbe surprised if sirius had punched a wall in he didntthough sirius and james were walking briskly down the corridors and talking in hushed tones lily had leisurely walked behind them with remus at her side the redhead rested her head on the boy frail shoulder as they walked lily really didntwant to go to astrology tonight so she voiced her thoughts you cantskive off class remus had reasoned does it look like i really care you were overcharging the spell what lily questioned as she lifted her head you were overcharging the spell remus repeated how well you were putting too much magical energy on the actually incantation and straining yourself with the memory i was doing the exact same thing that why we feel like we re dead james and sirius didntovercharge it so they feel fine you and james practically got to the same point of the spell even though james got a little farther but you should essentially have the same energy he has but you don t how did you become so smart lily asked i read a lot lily laughed as a full smile appeared on her face yes it must have been books august and remus both read like there was no tomorrow and both were incredibly bright the two prefects reached gryffindor tower and loitered in the common room lily had announced she was going to skip astrology for today due to her lack of energy remus had then commented he would catch her up because he had to go you dont have to lily stressed i going to be missing classes in a couple weeks remus replied with a miserable look on his face i cantbe behind oh lily felt like an idiot for not remembering about the full moon lily gave an apologetic smile before she gave him a hug goodnight the redhead turned and walked up to her dormitory dragging her bag behind her she walked towards her bed and collapsed down upon it lily didnteven bother to change into her pajamas she was too tired within a minute lily had fallen asleep lily only wanted to learn how to conjure a patronus because it looked absolutely wicked she didntknow that when she graduated hogwarts she would be using the spell quite a lot the one memory that lily needed to conjure her patronus hadnteven happened yet so her months of practice would be futile her friendship with two of the marauders would lead to her slow paced friendship with james potter her feelings would grow for the messy haired boy and her hatred for him would turn into love with her friendship with the boys would falter her friendship with rhia and august that however wasntfor years to come author notes i hope you enjoyed the new installment please review and tell me your comments chapter summary take a seat next to the fireplace my ladies and fellow gents sirius walked over towards a scarlet loveseat and sat down what is this place lily asked in wonderment as she took a seat in a cozy mustard colored chair the room of requirements peter piped up as he took a seat in a green colored chair chapter title mirages versus marauders patronus lessons suck two lessons later and i still cantget past that stupid mist remus almost has the patronus it not clear exactly what animal it is yet but as soon as he gets it 100 corporeal then everyone will know what it is potter seems to be getting worse at his patronus he had a tail but now he back to a swirl of mist like me poor sirius he still cantget even a small amount of silver smoke to emit from his wand he needs to get several extraordinary memories the headmaster had approved the halloween festivities and now it was time to figure out exactly what was going to be done i was placed in a group with remy frankie and alice to organize the decorations and then hang them the event is to take place in the great hall like usual but the decorations cantbe hung until halloween day this means that all prefects have to skip the hogsmeade weekend oh joys joys beyond joys just what i want to be doing note my sarcasm it isntas though it that hard peter sirius black sounded irritated lily pen was hovering over her journal as her ears perked up to the conversation what wasntthat hard lily slouched her body down farther in the comfy chair by the fireplace so that the boys wouldntsee her in the room they were walking down the stairs into the common room you and james are smarter than me i just need some more practice peter protested listen james voice filled the room sirius and i arentgoing to stick around here and help you tonight we ll go over it tomorrow with you but right now sirius and i can transform we re going to keep remus company you guys went without me last month peter whined in an annoying tone we know peter sirius stressed but remus needs us more than you do right now his bloody bones and limbs are cracking and breaking right now he in a lot of pain and he needs company before he starts hurting himself lily slouched down farther into the chair and gripped her journal closely to her chest oh god they re talking about his transformations they re going to go see remus and get themselves killed lily thought frantically she couldntlet them they would die or get bitten if that happened then remus was either killed or disposed of in azkaban for the rest of his life it wasntfair that you two worked on the animagus transformation over the summer without me peter complained animagus they were turning into animals were the idiots did they even know how much trouble they could get into did they know that they could die god she knew that potter and black were idiots how could remus even allow them to think about attempting it without adult supervision should have suspected something like that from black and potter lily thought so bloody stupid i owled you at least five times peter james snapped i never got one reply remus replied the next day and sirius didnteven reply he just showed up i i was busy peter cried in protest well that isntour problem now is it petey sirius spoke snidely come on james said impatiently prongs is ready to come out moony is waiting for prongs and padfoot sirius and james didntwait for peter to complain anymore they strolled pass their friend and passed lily chair james was holding a glittering cloak in his right hand before they went out of the portrait hole james swept the cloak over himself and sirius and disappeared lily stayed slouched in the chair and waited for peter to tread back up to the dormitory which he soon did the mousy boy muttered the whole way up lily grip on her journal loosened and her hands quickly found the armrests she hoisted herself up from the uncomfortable position to stand up and stretch causing her journal to land on the floor with a soft thump the fire crackling in the fireplace started to die slowly the flame was barely looking alive the fire looked much like lily felt small exhausted and just wanting to sleep for the rest of her life reaching down lily long fingers grasped her journal she tucked it in her bag that was resting next to the armchair trying to keep the images of james and sirius not being able to transform and being ripped to shreds by a tiny werewolf lily made her way up to her dormitory to sleep tossing and turning all night allowed the prefect to only get a couple hours of sleep horrifying sounds of snapping limbs filled lily ears when august alarm went off lily jumped out of bed and scrambled to get her clothes on she got several concerned looks but didntpay any attention to them lily august asked as she touched her friend shoulder what dark circles resided under dull emerald eyes lily looked like she had been run over by a train at least fifty times her irritability was up due to lack of sleep with a piercing glare august seemed slightly taken back nevertheless august asked why are you up so early without a word lily snatched her satchel and stormed out of the room the redhead wasntquite presentable to be going to class today her school robes were draped across the back of a chair in the dormitory her tie was stuffed somewhere in her school bag she had slipped sneakers onto her feet her dress shirt was unbuttoned to reveal a green tank top underneath it oh professors would be furious with her newfound look the prefect sneakers squeaked on the stone floors every now and then in a swift movement lily grasped a brush in her hands and started to brush her hair brushing didntreally help the mess of curls but only made more snarls giving up on making herself somewhat presentable lily gave up and went straight to the infirmary once there she burst through the doors to look for a familiar face my word madam pomfrey exclaimed what happened to you to lily annoyance the school nurse rushed over towards her and started prodding her with a wand the prefect smacked it away with her hand only to find the wand poke at another part of her body it wasntuntil lily said she was just there to see someone that the nurse stopped you could have said something i tried but you were too busy treating me as though i were cattle lily shot back well there is no one here today miss evans so why dontyou scuttle out of here remus lupin isnthere as if on queue the sanatorium doors opened to reveal three students being half dragged in the middle was a pale and bloody remus lupin his arms were weakly draped over the shoulders of sirius black and james potter sirius and james seemed to be supporting the frail looking boy tears stung lily eyes at the sight of remus no one deserved that miss evans get out of here madam pomfrey rushed over towards the three boys we went to fetch him as soon as we woke up james spoke nervously as his eyes darted towards lily his neck and back are pretty messed up sirius continued take him to the bed madam pomfrey instructed before turning back to lily you are to tell no one what you saw go to class lily slowly backed out of the hospital wing as tears flowed freely down her face how could someone so nice and compassionate be in so much pain he wouldnthurt a fly and yet he had to go through that every month lily back found the stonewall and she slid down it her knees were being hugged close to her chest it wasntfair the doors of the infirmary opened again and sirius black sat down next to lily he wrapped an arm around the redhead and pulled her close to his chest lily buried her face into the folds of sirius robes and welcomed the embrace after what seemed like forever lily pulled back her red face and looked into the boy pale eyes you canttell anyone what you saw lily sirius spoke seriously i know remus is a werewolf the prefect replied he told me last month you dontcare no lily replied simply as she wiped her face i never knew they were that bad the transformations hurt him a lot i noticed i feel like an idiot for crying lily let out a small choked laugh the first time james and i went to retrieve him i know i cried sirius gave an embarrassed sort of smile as he spoke i remember i was only twelve at the time and we had just figured out what had been going on he was so bloody and so pale i stopped dead in my tracks i had never seen anything like it before james went ahead and took off his cloak to wrap it around remus james turned to me and told me he needed help getting back to the castle i went over i didnteven know tears were pouring down my face until james told me that image haunted me for months it doesntnow you get used to it after several years sirius replied as though it were nothing i highly doubt i would lily replied no i suppose you wouldn t classes were extremely drawn out today vanderveer ranted on about different kinds of hexes and curses in defense truax had instructed them to make the most complex potion they knew then charms professor flitwick had reviewed what they had gone over so far as if trying to help them remember the main points for their o w l s sirius and james looked slightly worried the whole day during classes they didntjoke or pull one prank not that lily saw that is after dinner lily had gone straight to the infirmary to see how remus was doing when she walked in lily half expected for madam pomfrey to either prod her or shout for her to get out again neither of them happened however the redhead walked farther into the hospital wing and saw that the very last bed had its drapery drawn she stood outside as she was unsure of what to do ripe the drapery down or call out his name she thought it would be best to call his name remus there was a soft murmur from behind the cloth lily reached out and opened the drapery to see remy lupin curled up under the stiff hospital sheets his amber eyes were watching her with curiosity and anxiety he feebly motioned a hand for his prefect partner to take a seat only there werentany seats around his bed so lily decided to sit on the edge of the bed remus looked dreadful his skin was stretched on his body and several places bones were protruding out his cheekbones looked as if they were going to break the skin his fingers and arms looked skeleton they looked slightly more hairy than usual there were dark bags residing under his eyes his hair looked greyer then it usually did there were various bite marks and scratches all over his visible body and probably even where lily couldntsee hi remus spoke hoarsely hey lily greeted with a comforting smile as she reached out and grasped his hand in hers usually the first day the worst i see that lily had no idea what to say to the boy she had wanted to give him reassurance that there were other people beside black and potter that cared about him and his well being at the moment lily wanted nothing more than to just walk away and talk to him when he didntlook as though he had just died there were more lines that covered his face especially on his forehead are you okay remus asked concerned am i okay remy i should be asking you that question lily said as she gave his hand a small squeeze how are you doing wolfe i ve been asked that question more times than i care to count today remus replied i fine i saw sirius and james bring you in here this morning lily added i wanted to see how you were doing but you werenteven here yet i dontremember much of what happened this morning remus spoke honestly as he scrunched up his face in thought i remember sirius patting my face so that i d wake up then james covered me with his cloak i remember them asking me if i was okay and i remember them picking me up and helping get here i never remember much in the morning after the transformation i so sorry you had to go through that lily declared as tears filled her eyes please don t lily remus sounded guilty please just joke and be yourself lily let out a soft chuckle and a smile spread appeared her face she could be herself if that meant remus would be happy lily just hated seeing one of her friends in such pain the two had chatted about the masquerade and the christmas dance they talked about classes and teachers they even poked fun at paris van arden it was nearly eight when remus was discharged from the hospital wing the two prefects had walked back to gryffindor tower together once they arrived they saw the rest of the marauders sitting by the fireplace talking in low voices with their wands drawn on the other side of the room was rhia and august who were looking over a bit of parchment lily went towards her friends and remus to his lily sat down next to august to see what the girls were looking at it was a bit of parchment that had mirages vs marauders written in rhia loopy handwriting next to the piece of parchment was another one that had rules written on top of it in handwriting that lily never saw before it was a small messy script that most likely belonged to a boy down the paper lily could spot her best friend handwriting what is this lily asked we meaning august you and myself are competing with james sirius peter and remus rhia replied as she pulled out two more sheets of parchment and handed them to lily competing inquired lily yes august responded as she pushed her glasses up her nose this one is for you to contact rhia and myself rhia handed lily one sheet of blank parchment the dark haired girl went on to explain that all she had to do was write a message down on the paper and the ink would seep through and appear on rhia and august sheets she then handed lily the other parchment which had a small m written in the top corner that one august started is if you need to contact the boys wait lily declared i utterly confused james sirius and i were talking rhia answered and we thought that it would be best if we had a little competition what kind of competition a friendly competition august supplied what kind of friendly competition lily stressed read the rules rhia stated as she threw the parchment with rules written on the top to lily rules 1 no one but the marauders and the mirages can be acknowledged of the competition 2 under no circumstance can the teams be changed 3 competition ends at the end of the year and under no circumstance before hand 4 points will be added up at the end of each month in a meeting between the two teams 5 points will be awarded to the mirages to make up for their lack of a member 6 competition will test mental emotional physical and magical aspects 7 competition is always on 8 competition is to remain friendly at all times 9 mirages need nicknames 10 no specific rule but rules need to end on an even number lily read the rules at least five times and was still baffled at what exactly was going on who were the mirages oh no lily thought please not let that be rhia august and myself the redhead turned when she saw the four marauders walking towards their small group sirius motioned the girls to follow and immediately rhia and august stood up lily stood up also unsure of what else she was supposed to be doing maybe she would get some explanations it was nearly past curfew but the group of nine gryffindors walked out of the portrait hole evans since you and remus are prefects you re going to walk without cover james spoke briefly cromwell and diefendorf get under the cloak august and rhia crowded next to sirius peter and james james swooped the glittery cloak and the five teenagers disappeared except for a foot that was sticking out remus grabbed his fellow prefect arm and the two started to walk lily could hear the five footsteps behind her how arentthey visible lily whispered to remus invisibility cloak the group walked all the way to the seventh floor where there was an awfully ugly tapestry hanging on the wall sirius appeared from underneath the cloak and started pacing past the tapestry three times before a handle appeared he grasped the handle and the gryffindors walked into the room the room was a comfortable place that looked almost exactly like the gryffindor common room there were squishy chairs and couches around a coffee table which was directly in front of a fireplace behind the seating area was a wooden table with nine mismatched chairs surrounding it on two of the walls were bookcases that were filled from floor to ceiling with books take a seat next to the fireplace my ladies and fellow gents sirius walked over towards a scarlet loveseat and sat down what is this place lily asked in wonderment as she took a seat in a cozy mustard colored chair the room of requirements peter piped up as he took a seat in a green colored chair oh lily uttered so what is this contest exactly james and rhia were fighting about who was smarter boys or girls august answered as she took a seat next to remus on a golden colored couch so sirius thought we d make a competition out of it rhia responded all points will be recorded on nine pieces of parchment so that each member knows exactly how many points have been awarded sirius explained everything from classes to extracurricular activities james divulged say cromwell answers a question correctly in mcgonagall class on each of our scorecards ten points will appear under cromwell name when we do practical magic the first person to succeed gets twenty points the second person will get fifteen third will get ten and fourth will get five all of those points will appear immediately on the scorecards all of you will be going to the patronus lessons that remus james lily and myself have been going to sirius commanded the first one to get a corporeal patronus will earn their team fifty points second will earn forty and so on there will be special contests out side of classes to represent things besides intelligence rhia announced those will be held after the prefects have stopped patrolling for the night there is no cheating august started to explain you cannot take lucky potions cheating quills or perform any spell or drink any potion that will make you smarter if you do then on the scorecards there will be a deduction of eighty points for cheating since the girls have one less player james interrupted at the end of each month the player on our team who has the least amount of points will share the points with a made up player on your team how is that fair lily cut in on the explanations say that you were losing by 160 points sirius clarified and say that our lowest scorer had 170 points you would automatically win that month say however that our lowest scorer had 150 points that means our team wins that month so one set of points is totally knocked out lily tried to understand exactly james replied and we re the mirages yes i thought it was absolutely a fabulous name rhia replied smiling what about that rule the one that said the mirages need nicknames i go by padfoot remus is moony james is prongs and peter has yet to receive a nickname sirius declared as his gray eyes wandered over towards peter you three need nicknames like that so that we can call each other by only nicknames what if i dontwant to do this lily inquired you will how do you know i want a part of this because poppet you like to show off sirius said with a smirk lily leaned back in her comfy chair and thought about what the gryffindors were suggesting the redhead wanted to do it she wanted to deflate potter overbearing ego lily wanted to put him in his place oh it would be bittersweet to win there was no way the girls couldntwin girls were smarter then boys i in lily announced remus will make the scorecards with august by next month sirius notified with his gorgeous smile poppet how about you and i write down all the point values of everything we can think of so that moony and august can make up the scorecards sounds like a plan lily hadntknown it at the time but sirius had suggested the competition only to help james and lily become friends his plan backfired and lily would end up hating james potter more than she had before the nine gryffindors had signed a paper that night saying that under no circumstance would the stop the competition before the end of the year unless they wanted to have a burn on their arm that said weak a parchment that james had spelled there would be a time in the next couple of months when lily would want to stop the competition but would keep going through with it even though she had been mentally scarred due to one fatal day in hogsmeade author notes hey if i get lots of reviews say like 20 by friday then i will post the next chapter up on friday instead of waiting for a whole week to post i had been debating whether or not to put in this competition but i thought that it was necessary i have finished hbp and i guess my story is now labeled as au due to one small detail i am going to be incorporating one small part of hbp into this story but not for several chapters i ll warn you before i put up that chapter
