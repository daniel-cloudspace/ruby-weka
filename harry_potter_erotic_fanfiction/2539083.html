 author note i realise i update quite often so it must be tempting to not give me a review but looking at the number of hits to reviews ratio it seriously depresses me please please dontjust read and then not review it breaks my heart hahaha ok not really but i d really appreciate it say if i get at least 5 reviews before my next update i ll be happy alrite enjoy giving up is hard to do it was a few days since that eventful ball and lily sat in her dorm arms folded leaning against the headboard of her large head bed she hadntspoken to james since the dance and it had basically been down to avoiding him crazily anytime he would see her his face would seemingly light up to approach her but she would turn and walk in the opposite direction besides apparently wanting to talk to lily james was still with steph and lily saw that although snogging was the main part to their relationship she wasntcompletely mindless like the other airheads james had dated in the past when he laughed with her lily saw that it was genuine laughter and the interest on his face during a conversation wasntbeing faked for some reason this was causing a throbbing pang in her chest which she just couldntunderstand the head girl leaned back sighing deeply and stared at the ceiling her transfiguration book forgotten she had been the one to reject him so why did she feel so awful a sickle for your thoughts wood whispered joining her on the bed interrupting her self questioning oh hi dave anything wrong sweetheart he said in his concerned thick scottish accent lily sighed inwardly as he stroked her cheek gently she was a terrible person here david was being this brilliant boyfriend and all she could think about was that insufferable prat james feeling extremely guilty she tried heavily to focus her concentration on his deep brown eyes she smiled at his concern and leaned forward to kiss him after a few minutes lily broke away and moved over so david could climb fully on to the bed he did so eyes widening slightly and kissed her again deeper burying his hands in her silky red hair although they were now in a lying down position lily still couldntget comfortable she shifted every two seconds finally leading wood to break the kiss frustrated lils is there something wrong did i do something wrong he asked quickly not wanting to give him a truthful answer lily just shook her head and grabbed him close trying desperately to feel the spark she d felt on halloween night a spark she d felt without even kissing the guy the guy with black hair hazel eyes and lopsided glasses the guy who had said he d loved her the guy she d turned away wood pulled off her again what wrong dave did i do something now lily asked knowing full well what his answer would be no no lils it not you i guess i just not feeling it tonight i sorry he replied giving her an unexpected answer just a lot on my mind y know yeh same here david gave her a peck on the cheek and mumbled something about needing to help cassie with quidditch training and left lily tried to relax putting down the awkward situation to bad moods on both people parts she knew however in her heart it was more than that she couldntkiss david when she was imagining running her hands through black messy hair instead of neat brown james slumped in his chair miserably down in the common room remus and sirius looked on concerned peter quickly glanced at sirius and followed his move remus sat on either side of james in large armchairs as peter sat in front of him on a spare cushion they all stared into space miserable for a moment until sirius looked at james and took a deep breath james i didntwanna bring this up the past few days cos steph seemed to be cheering you up but are you y know ok about this whole evans thing he asked carefully no james answered listlessly looking past his friends and up at the girl staircase remus and sirius exchanged worried looks and remus tried this time so um how re you feeling about lily saying no james we should talk about this man you look like you re about to avada yourself remus said knitting his brows together it ll help man sirius assured drawing nods from peter james looked at peter for a moment and then took a deep breath i gave up on her lads gave up on the bloody love of my life remus looked down sadly and nodded stimulating peter to copy him eager to please his friends with showing concern sirius however raised an eyebrow look mate it like i said screw love forget evans this was the best thing for you to do giving up on her made room for steph she cool he tried to convince a reluctant james sending remus a look to encourage him to help yeh james steph great and she really likes you remus joined quickly picking up on sirius idea james shook his head slightly as if trying to physically shake himself of lily you know what you re right padfoot of course i am sirius said grinning and that right moony she does like me james said standing up with slightly more confidence looming you got it mate remus agreed happily and wormtail james trailed off a second looking at the now eager excited to join in peter got up too um well pete if you d said anything you would be right too cos i going to move on james triumphantly announced good on you prongs sirius said clapping him on the back their celebrations however were interrupted by several things peter suddenly gave a sudden jerk and with a grimace on his face stutteringly announced he forgotten he had extra potions now as he scurried out rubbing his arm professor mcgonagall entered the portrait hole and pointed at sirius beckoning him with a long finger sirius instantly realising he forgot his detention sent her a flashy smile my dear wonderful powerful teacher will you ever forgive me he inquired jokingly before wincing as she towed him out holding on to his ear as james and remus laughed they were interrupted by a slight cough as lily stepped down the last step of the staircase to arrive in the common room remus looked uncomfortably from james to lily and after receiving nods from them he rushed off to a corner to bury himself in defence against the dark arts homework lily eyes met james and she opened her mouth to speak however nothing came out so she closed it again james stuck one hand in his pocket and the other one rubbed his neck as he tried not to look at her he hoped she hadntheard the marauder conversation just moments ago lily approached james nervously pretending to have not heard that he was moving on when she was close enough she gestured to the chairs so they could sit down he obliged awkwardly and refused to meet her eyes not knowing what to say lily blurted out you said you wanted to explain something to me yesterday james eyes rounded and he looked possibly more awkward than before oh that um well ok evans he started gaining steadiness in his voice well basically i wanted to explain about the ball or the end of the ball there no need to explain james i said no so naturally it fine for you to want to pursue someone else instead lily said trying to limit the curtness in her voice no no it wasntlike that i was feeling miserable about you so i did what any idiotic guy with un returned love would do but you re with her now arentyou she accused in a business like manner yes but only cos i canthave you lily it my way of finding a way to move on i may have given up on getting you lily evans but i i cantstop loving you he exploded in a rush then reddening at his comment he looked away well i suppose that best um i suppose i ll see you around lily said getting up not wanting to hear anymore she smiled at him in a forced sort of way and retreated back up the staircase quickly james leant forward putting his head in his hands maybe sirius was right was love really worth feeling this pain in his chest every time lily walked away from him then remembering the softness of her lips he silently knew the answer though he tried to forget it jeminadotm5 you m dear are an absolute star for reviewing again thanks sadly i guess they both have to suffer a little heartbreak before they get together it good you re feeling sorry for the characters it what i was hoping for grins ange marauder obsessive if i had a box of gold stars i d give you tons that was such a nice encouraging review and i hate peter with a passion too stupid

and wood yeh i meant him to be oliver dad is supposed to be like this too perfect guy you know who you re meant to love but just cantfor some reason too perfect i guess ahaha anway enjoy the best part of breaking up it was nearing christmas so the grand hall was brewing with excited young witches and wizards talking of holiday plans sirius sat with remus and peter at the gryffindor table laughing discreetly at james who was sitting among the hufflepuffs with steph they had been together just over a month and his friends knew for a fact that james was getting a little tired of putting up with the duffers in her house they also knew that as nice as steph was she was just no lily to james despite the constant physical aspect of their relationship he was ready to break it off y know at least when he liked evans he sat with us sirius complained eyeing james who was slumped next to steph looking at the gryffindors longingly sirius could see him strain to not roll his eyes as everyone at his table laughed at a rather feeble joke feeling sirius eyes on him he gave him a look to say get me out of here sirius comment however earned him an elbow in the ribs from remus shut it she sitting like two metres away padfoot oh who gives a shit sirius hates lily anyways peter piped up looking at his friend for approval sirius stared at peter obviously annoyed he d spoken for him however remembering james words from the previous week he decided to just nod james had made him promise to cut peter a break because after all werentmarauders meant to trust one another he doesnthate her does he do you sirius remus was asking urgently oh no i just think she an insufferable know it all sometimes sirius said with an afterthought yeah she annoying right peter eagerly put forward again hoping sirius would agree pete she nice to you what the hell d you have against her sirius reasoned fairly he knew she was a nice girl despite their personalities clashing oh um uh she took points from me peter filled in rather weakly wormtail you probably deserved it remus argued raising an eyebrow sirius rolled his eyes this conversation was getting a bit ridiculous ah shattup guys wormtail my man you really dontneed to try and get on my good side we re cool now ok sirius decided to abolish peter worries before his lips were permanently attached to sirius rear end peter beamed and quietened down stuffing bacon in his already bulging mouth remus silently mouthed thanks to sirius before returning to his book now getting completely bored being starved for attention sirius decided to yell loudly across the hall jamesie i neeeeed youuu stop ignoring mee he said standing up folding his arms and pouting the surrounding people laughed and james looked a bit embarrassed he whispered something to steph before standing up and sauntering towards the gryffindor table no worries honeyyyy i home he said jokingly drawing more laughter from his on looking schoolmates he then crushed sirius in a hug who yelped in horror oi get off me you big lump you think you can just come here and hug me and i ll be your friend again sirius said in a mock stern voice raising his tone to a falsetto to imitate an angry girlfriend what when i look like this of course james replied playing along with his friend ridiculous clowning by putting on an unnaturally deep voice oh you re right the only person better looking than you is sirius black and goodness knows where he gone sirius countered cheekily keeping up his falsetto james laughed and grabbed sirius in a headlock and messed up his hair their audience laughed again and clapped a little at their performancebefore gradually returning to their lunch whilst the two marauders mock wrestled ivana laughed along with diya from their place on the table quite far away from the marauders lily reluctantly let a smile creep on to her face those two could be so hilarious when they werentpicking on people she couldntallow herself to laugh however because she and sirius werentexactly friends and she had barely been able to look at james since he explained he d given up on her and he was still with that steph girl it really didnthelp that things with david hadntmuch improved they were slipping further and further away from each other and wood seemed to be training cassie at all spare moments to avoid seeing lily being so non responsive towards him she felt awful that he wanted to avoid her because she wasntbeing a good girlfriend the past month had been incredibly rocky for them and anytime things started to return to normal wood brown hair seemed to turn black whilst kissing him and she knew she was imagining james lily sighed heavily suddenly someone tapped her on the shoulder and the looks on ivana and diya face suggested it was something serious lily turned to see her boyfriend nervously biting his lip as he beckoned for her to follow him out of the hall james finally let go of a red faced sirius who was insisting he d let james win when his eye caught a flash of auburn at the door lily was following wood out of the hall he sighed heavily but tried to push his discomfort away by joining sirius as he made fun of moony get your nose out the book remus it only a defence quiz sirius complained yes so test me please naww i already know it go on go make out with chaterjee for a bit it healthier you sure about that padfoot james said eyes twinkling as he knew remus would jump at them for that comment well as long as they can detach by the end of lunch it should be ok sirius pretended to think as he caught on to james joking ha ha very funny remus rolled his eyes sarcastically before getting up to join diya and ivana however he seemed strangely less enthusiasticthan usual um i forgot my textbook peter mumbled as he stared vaguely across the hall and rushed off after polishing off their lunch james and sirius decided to go keep a very disgusted ivana and the snogging couple company before they all headed to lessons meanwhile lily and david were sitting uncomfortably next to each other on a bench outside the hall lily we need to talk david said breaking the awkward silence it been really different lately between us i mean we dontlaugh the same way we used to we donttalk interestedly anymore i mean we donteven kiss the way we used to i know dave i ve just had a lot on my mind i sorry lily pleaded with him not looking him in the eyes she was afraid to be alone there was an unusual silence after she said this however so she looked at david he was looking confused at her comment you re sorry i thought um well i was going to apologise cos it me who hasntbeen very responsive he said looking past her guiltily lily was surprised she wasntexpecting this when things hadntbeen working between them she had simply assumed it was all her fault lily i think you re an amazing person but well cassie kissed me yesterday i i think i might be in love with her lily wood was looking very guilty as he surveyed her face a weight inside lily seemed to lift you re really decent dave thanks for telling me as soon as it happened you know um and you know what kind of funny i think i might be in love with someone else too lily breathed a sigh of relief and started giggling wood laughed in relief too no joke well wow this was sorta easy hey lily kept giggling yeah it was friends definitely wood wrapped lily in a hug and they both smiled warmly at each other well lils i gotta go find cass i ll see you for head duty later eh with that he got up and waved at her great good luck dave lily grinned as she waved back she then headed for class with a smile on her face she loved james now it was over with david she was sure of it she was allowed to love james she turned a corner happily but suddenly her face fell steph was kissing james outside the defence against the dark arts classroom and he didntseem to be complaining a large pang hit her heart as she silently passed them and swept into the classroom trying hard not to be disappointed she had been so sure they were on the verge of breaking up huddling in her usual corner at the front of the class she blinked back the tears which kept threatening to surface especially when james sauntered in with a large smile on his face as sirius ruffled his hair professor flabbergast absently hummed o ye merry hippogriffs under his breath as he watched the seventh year class involved in their quiz students were sending him rather distracted huffy looks but he didntseem to notice sirius was watching his fellow classmates give the teacher dirty looks because they wanted to concentrate on finishing the test he smiled amused because he had already finished it swinging on to the back two legs of his chair he surveyed the people in front of him james had obviously finished too because sirius could now visibly see him as always tracing the initials l e on to a spare piece of parchment remus was bent over his work meticulously checking his answers which made sirius roll his eyes because he would bet his broomstick remus had gotten them all correct anyway his eyes then came to watch peter who looked as though he might cry with confusion diya sitting in the front row of the class was lazily twirling her quill in her fingers sirius guessed that unlike himself she wasntfinished but waswasting time rather than getting down to work ivana sat next to her cutely chewing on the end of her quill deep in thoughtbefore smiling as she remembered an answer evans was beside her staring idly out of the window looking depressed then suddenly realising she was in an exam she quickly bent over her work the girl beside sirius let out an exasperated sigh as she threw a death glare at the still humming professor sirius inwardly laughed then feeling guilty that the others were more easily distracted sirius decided to do something to stop the teacher humming o ye merry hippogriffs sirius sang out loudly getting to his feet gaining shocked looks from everyone in the classroom the professor stopped humming and gaped at sirius like he was mad james looked up at his best mate and absently crossed out the letters l e then joining in with the fun he also got to his feet and sang with thou shiny talons and sharp beak james looked back atsirius who was grinning and they both sang together bless thee happy hippogriffs merry merry merry that will be enough black potter this is an exam professor flabbergast yelled scandalised oh sorry professor it just you were singing my favourite carol sirius stated a smirk on his stifled a laugh and winked at sirius before the pair of them sat down proudly the class chuckled instantly registering why the two boys had done what they did they then returned to their papers thankful for the silence that followed as the dumbfounded professor blushed and started grading papers forty minutes later the class streamed out of the classroom tittering about james and sirius mid exam interruption the marauders headed off in some random direction whilst people watched in admiration as sirius and james laughed at each other strutting a little remus was rolling his eyes and peter was trailing the three girls headed for the common room to relax and after seeing the sad look on lily face to talk so lils what up diya inquired settling on a cushion in the corner of the common room ivana summoned another two cushions and gestured for lily to sit before plopping down herself well me and dave broke up lily said indifferently but you re ok about that ivana asked slowly yes it wasntworking cos well we both kept thinking of other people he in love with cassie she answered smiling a little at the cute couple diya arched a perfect eyebrow and you re ok about that yes lily insisted ok well if you re ok with it then wait you re in love with somebody else ivana questioned sitting up straight um well i dontknow about love exactly but i cantstop thinking about him lily looked a bit sad at this and looked away her eyes glistening a moment ok so james obviously diya said motioning for lily to carry on ivana nodded in agreement wait you guys know lily looked a little startled ivana just rolled her eyes but diya answered her exasperatedly of course we did lils every time you were insisting you liked wood not potter it wasntus you were trying to convince and if it james then it definitely love for you lily again ivana nodded in agreement no he just he a good kisser he attractive oh god i donteven know anymore i guess yeh i guess i am in love with him it was diya turn to roll her eyes so ivana said yes m dear we know this is great you guys together is so adorable its perfect he over me though he was kissing steph like there was no tomorrow today when i passed them tears threatened the corners of lily eyes as she looked earnestly at her two suddenly saddened friends yeah she not the same as the sorta girls he goes out with she decent ivana divulged rather reluctantly i dontthink he over you lily but i mean you rejected him so many times maybe it d just be his pride which is stopping him maybe that why he gave up diya said thoughtfully so i guess i missed my chance then lily whispered before dissolving into tears ivana and diya exchanged distressed looks before wrapping her into a comforting hug finally it christmas remus exhaled rubbing his eyes presents peter said childishly o ye merry hippogriffs sirius sang softly throwing an amused look at james remus meanwhile threw him a dirty look you guys gonna come stay at mine for a couple of days yeh james asked remus and peter he received a nod from remus after he had pushed sirius roughly to shut him up however peter declined i would james it just my aunt wanted me to stay at her the whole time he said in a hurry his words overlapping each other this caused sirius to look at him puzzled whilst james simply said oh no matter i expect we ll see you somewhere anyway ohh padfoot what re we gonna do we when we get home i cantwait to get away from here for a while home eat your mama roast chicken sleep go to london to look for an apartment for me go back to yours eat some more sleep sirius listed checking the events off on his fingers an apartment remus asked interestedly yeah i cantimpose on the potters forever now can i sirius my parents are fine with it you know that james insisted defiantly no james i have to move out after this year you ve put up with me way too long sirius exclaimed in a tone which warned james not to argue oh alright but you know mi casa es su casa ok sirius grinned and directed the marauders down a new passageway he d discovered oh i have to buy presents as well shite for you four mum dad and ivana and diya and lil james trailed off and looked upset steph remember remus interjected hopefully dumped her sirius explained patting james on the back as he continued to look devastated oh really when oh just before class she was surprisingly cool about it which made me feel sorta bad she was really nice just she not lily i gave her a goodbye kiss as well james clarified ooohh first girl you did that for sirius said trying to lighten the mood peter taking this as a sign laughed loudly looking at sirius who promptlyrolled his eyes discreetly james smiled slightly yeh she nice maybe you should go out with her padfoot he recommended but laughed when sirius put on a face of mock horror naw but anyway lily just swept past like it didnteven bother her james face went sulky again maybe she was pretending peter hopefully suggested shut it pete dontget his hopes up again sirius nudged him as james looked if possible even sadder please review if you liked it hated it i dontmind author note another chapter thanks to all who reviewed recently jeminadotm5 hpandhgforeva

just after i was about to update so i thought i d better mention you anyway thanks and pls review again voldemort apartments and letters ah christmas in a place where people like you what else could i ask for sirius said settling on to the conjured up bed in james room james lay back on his own bed and stayed silent for a moment taking in the warmth of his room he sleepily spoke to sirius who said people here like you with a slight smile on his face sirius chucked a pillow at his friend half heartedly and stretched out however their relaxation was suddenly interrupted by a smooth woman voice calling from downstairs boys if you think i going to let you waste a beautiful day like this sleeping upstairs you are entirely wrong get down here this instant james mother called james rolled his eyes and tried putting a pillow over his head however sirius was up and straightening his clothes in an instant after smacking james over the head he dragged him downstairs to go meet mrs potter in the kitchen number 6 at godric hollowallowed heaps of sunshine into the whole house maintaining the most cheerful atmosphere in the entire village so much unlike number 12 grimmauld place where the black family lived mrs potter was bustling about the kitchen hurriedly fixing lunch when the two boys trooped downstairs james hugged his mother and gave her a kiss on the cheek before plopping down next to sirius who sat at the table smirking oh mrs potter that wouldntbe your delicious roast chicken you re cooking is it he asked charmingly drawing a smile from the woman face yes mr black and just for that you get a little extra gravy the plumpish motherly woman pinched sirius cheeks and smoothened his hair before returning to the stove sirius grinned and shook his head so that his trademark lock of hair fell back into his eyes mum is dad coming home for lunch james inquired grabbing two apples off the counter and tossing one to sirius before taking a huge bite from his own mrs potter immediately grabbed the apples from the two bewildered boys hands and answered yes he is mr malkippins let him have the afternoon off after the week he had and dontyou dare ruin your appetites as if on queue mr potter arrived in the kitchen with a loud pop and ruffled james hair before kissing his wife swiftly he then turned to sirius ah sirius good to see you m boy ready to be stuffed full by my lovely wife here sirius nodded and laughed as mr potter received a loud thunk from his wife ladle connecting with his head ahhh margaret it was only a joke mrs potter pouted and handed the plates to james who reluctantly set the table he then whined to his parents sirius isntdoing anything that cos i their favourite son jamesie sirius retorted with a smirk dontbe silly james come on sirius pet please pour the juice james mum handed him a jug and affectionately cupped his chin once the family was all settled into their lunch sirius spoke to mr potter so how work at the ministry sir mr potter worked as an auror at the ministry of magic and often let the boys in on the newest scandals however now he frowned well the murders are getting more and more frequent lately if we could only pinpoint them to one person but there seems to be no pattern at all other than we have reason to believe they are all working for an extremely powerful dark wizard oh yeh me and padfoot were reading something about those guys in the daily prophet call themselves death eaters or something who the hell is this bloke anyway he calls himself lord voldemort the death eaters are his inner circle absolute treachery this is you wontbelieve the amount of casualties we ve been having at recently mrs potter filled them in shuddering she was an extremely gifted healer which perhaps further added to her sense of motherliness i reckon my cousin bella in league with this voldemort guy i wouldntbe surprised if regulus joined up too nasty little brute sirius muttered darkly it sad really the whole concept of some blood being better than others is rather pathetic i ashamed to say that other old wizarding families like us are arrogant enough to believe they are superior to muggle borns or half bloods mr potter stated angrily so this voldemort chap thinks there should only be purebloods in the wizarding world what codswallop we d have to perform incest eventually if that was gonna happen james let out a sharp annoyed laugh thinking of lily she was a muggle born yeah my whole family calls me a blood traitor simply cos i talk to muggle borns i reckon they re convinced the blacks should ve been royalty they re ashamed of me just cos i friends with people who like me dontgive a shit about someone background sirius was seething now as he stabbed the peas on his plate remus wasnta pureblood nor ivana he didntsee why they shouldntbe considered equals sirius mind your language young man but yes you re right people should never be big headed enough to believe they re superior simply because of their background now please let change the subject just saying that wizard name gives me the chills mrs potter exclaimed ending the conversation so what are you boys going to do today then mr potter asked vaguely looking for a flat sirius replied slowly a flat why mrs potter suddenly looked up horror striken dontworry mrs p jamesie is staying i just think i shouldntbe imposing on you anymore this summer i think i should move into a place of my own i tried telling him you guys didntmind james offered quickly whilst his mother shot him an upset glare sweetheart you re like a second son please wontyou stay with us come on freddy tell him mr potter remained quiet for a while he then cleared his throat i dontwant you to leave sirius but if this is what you feel you must do then you should just know there will always be a place for you at this table sirius smiled and thanked him then turning to a very distressed woman he said mrs p i swear i ll visit all the time i just you ve been so good to me i just cantpossibly keep crowding you all oh sirius promise me you ll come back any time you can i dontthink i could bear thinking of you alone in a flat watching it get messier and messier and mum relax sirius knows how to clean but oh alright then dear will you need a lift into london she said sniffling as she straightened the collar on sirius black shirt no thanks ma am we ll apparate sirius said smiling at her splendid now margaret you have to get back to work as do i so let leave these boys to their fun tally ho lads mr potter laughed as he tipped his hat to them and disappeared back to work mrs potter wiped her eyes hurriedly and waved her wand to clean up the mess on the table do take care boys she said as she too apparated to work now let go find me a flat prongs sirius shook the extremely short man hand warmly he had an enormous grin on his face as he handed over a good part of the inheritance money he d received from his favourite uncle as the landlord left sirius stood in the centre of the bare little flat and beamed at james who was trying not to smile back it like a bachelor pad mate you can come round anytime it ll be brilliant sirius said excitedly james couldntfight the contagious grin which was now on his face too ah damn you padfoot i meant to be proper angry at you if you found a place and you re making me smile s alright prongs you ll have me around til the summer anyway and after that d you honestly believe you could get rid of me that easy sirius grabbed his friend and messed up his hair oh i wish james laughed jokingly after making some arrangements with the landlord about the maintenance of sirius flat the two friends apparated to the leaky cauldron to meet up with remus it was late on christmas day at the chaterjee mansion when lily apparated into diya bedroom looking up from the pile of presents diya smiled and asked innocently security that bad eh lily laughed your house elf let me in after about 10 questions about you to prove i was your friend i heard ivana pop behind me so i reckon she going through it now too so how was your christmas oh not bad mum and dad were at the bank in the morning while i opened my presents but we had dinner togther now i think theyre having some alone time diya made a face but smiled her parents were always working as they owned huge amounts of shares in gringotts oh yeah i saw them downstairs quite snugly crack ivana looked quite dishevelled as she sat on the floor by diya bed and looked at her two friends diya your house elf is a nutter i got one question wrong and i had to answer another twenty the girls laughed and began to talk about their holidays the conversation slowly turned to presents and lily and ivana asked diya what remus gave her oh just this she said rather distractedly showing them a bottle of perfume everything alright with him ivana questioned as she frowned at the disinterest on diya face oh no no we ve just well run out of things to say in our letters i think but really it nothing she insisted as she noted the concern on the two girls faces really remus and i are doing fine what more important how are you and sirius iv ivana received a nudge and a wink from diya whilst lily carried a knowing smile oh shut it guys honestly we re just friends i used to think i might like him but i think we re better off this way we re really close you know she assured them shaking her head oh come on ivvy are you telling me you dontblush every time sirius smiles at you lily asked with a raised eyebrow and a smirk on her face no ok yeh sometimes i do but seriously sirius smile is just nice that all i swear anyway have you seen the way he ruffles my hair at every possible moment i like his little sister or something maybe he shy diya suggested thoughtfully sirius sirius black shy umm you must be joshing really guys i completely fine being friends with him ivana seemed completely serious as she said this so the girls accepted this as the truth the conversation then however turned to lily what about you lils anything new happen with james ivana looked concerned as she spoke softly lily grin faded and she answered oh no he probably too busy with steph or something diya shook her head no no remus told me he dumped her the day before we left school lily face brightened a little but almost instantly fell and he hasnteven written to me oh no guys he really over me i blew my chance didnti it was ivana turn to shake her head no no i bet he just trying to not push anything cos he doesntknow you like him i think you should tell him lily thought about this for a moment well d you think i should send him an owl or something she suggested hopefully diya squealed at this and ran for a piece of scented parchment here say something that ll suggest you like him lily bit her lip and smiled as she began to write her two friends peeked over her shoulder and giggled at what she was writing aghh i so full i think i going to burst remus exclaimed holding his stomach me too james agreed what are you amateurs talking about sirius asked between mouthfuls of more turkey the two other boys sent him disgusted looks before being distracted by a large barn owl flying through james window isntthat lily owl remus asked looking at james he was tearing off the seal of the note now curiously after giving the owl a dish of water he eagerly began to read dear james how was your christmas i hope it was good anyway i just wanted to write and tell you how much i ve missed you lately i cantstop thinking about you please write back and let me know how ve you been eh yours lily xxxx wow prongs that a lotta kisses sirius pointed out reading over his shoulder erm wow james this is really good news isntit remus said uncertainly shooting a look at him james was frowning what the hell is this supposed to mean he exclaimed frustrated she so bloody confusing this bird i mean one day she telling me she really doesntlike me and doesntfeel anything for me and the next minute she cantstop thinking about me what am i meant to think james exploded angrily thoroughly confused he put his head in his hands roughly girls sirius mumbled furiously well she did break up with wood maybe she realised she made a mistake remus put in fairly who does she think prongs is though man some big push over does she really believe he has no pride whatsoever bloody unfair that is sirius argued seizing the letter to examine it he right moony i have some pride you know i mean she just going to use me as a re bound or something it well unfair i going to write back he hurriedly grabbed a piece of parchment and scribbled something down heatedly lily i had a good christmas i sure you did too look let cut to the chase not to be rude or anything but exactly what d you think you re playing at just so you know rather than randomly getting my hopes up every once in a while i d much prefer you just leave me alone i dontthink that my heart can take much more of this game you insist on playing james nice one prongs um prongs it a tiny bit harsh maybe if you were politer or something remus started no moony no i ve had it with evans and her indecisiveness james cut in before tying the letter to the owl and sending it back to lily um ok mate just dontblame me if you re regretting it later remus said shaking his head slightly he wontregret it indecisive girls need to be put in their place sirius stated loyally although james was truly pissed off at that moment later on that night as he listened to remus and sirius breathe softly in their sleep he couldnthelp but feel a twinge of regret quietly he reached over to the bin by his bed and fished out lily crumpled up letter reading the words i cantstop thinking about you again by the light of the single candle he couldnthelp but wish he hadntacted on impulse as he slipped the note under his pillow and tried to drift off to sleep he thought sadly i d give anything to just turn back time and change what i wrote just click the little button down there and write me a review pretty please authors note this is areallllly long chapter by the way but it also my favourite so i hope you enjoy thanks to all who have reviewed will thank you next time cos you reallllly need to read this chapter i love it hahaha the new year project wow lily diya exclaimed as lily appeared at the top of the large white marble staircase in the chaterjee mansion ivana let out a low whistle you re gonna knock him dead tonight lils she agreed enthusiastically the pretty seventeen year old redhead however was less confident she was chewing nervously at her bottom lip as she looked down at her robes they were emerald green with silvery sheen on the edges of the material the green was intense and did not carry the harshness of the slytherin crest even the silver gave the clothing a certain elegance which the combination of green and silver of slytherin house had boldly steered clear of the colour brought out lily almond shaped eyes and rather than clashing with her auburn hair which was done in loose waves complimented it in other words she d never looked more beautiful it was the evening of the large new year party the chaterjee were throwing the large majority of the wizarding community had been invited to the home of this well respected family the reason lily was nervous plainly was because james would be there she glided down the staircase to the large marble ballroom where her two friends sat the worried grimace on her face has still not subsided she was thinking sadly about the owl she d received from james less than two weeks ago flashback as lily barn owl swooped into diya bedroom only hours after she d sent the first letter to james she shook with anticipation hurriedly untying the note from the owl leg she read the letter quickly lily i had a good christmas i sure you did too look let cut to the chase not to be rude or anything but exactly what d you think you re playing at just so you know rather than randomly getting my hopes up every once in a while i d much prefer you just leave me alone i dontthink that my heart can take much more of this game you insist on playing james ivana and diya looked on apprehensively and saw her face visibly fall she then turned extremely pale and dropped the letter at their feet whilst she looked out of the window wistfully after reading the letter thoroughly ivana let out an exasperated sigh what do you think you re playing at what does he think he playing at he wanted you and now that he close to having you suddenly he doesntwant you anymore arrogant self centred little she yelled furiously insulting her friend however diya cut her off this is great lily turned away from the window quickly brushing away the hint of tears forming in her eyes and looked at diya quizzically ivana looked incredulous as she gaped at diya diya m dear you ve finally gone off your rocker no no dontyou guys seee james isntover lily isntit glaringly obvious she pressed looking at them expectantly when all she received were blank stares she continued letting out an impatient huff get his hopes up again his heart canttake much more he still loves her now all we need to do is get his fat head past his pride and bingo destiny is fulfilled you know what scary that actually makes sense ivana commented you really think so but how he sounded so angry lily said nervously the three girls stayed silent for a few minutes thinking suddenly a wide smile spread on to diya face my new year party everyone ll be there it perfect she was rubbing her hands together now as she concocted a plan to help lily and james finally get together end of flashback listen lily just stick to the agenda and you re all set diya assured her excitedly remember flirt with james a little to soften him up then flirt with someone else then back to james then ignore the method hasntfailed me once ivana who looked far more uncertain than diya about the success of this plan put in reassuringly and merlin forbid that fails you always have a little thing called honesty to fall back on lily nodded now a bit confused and still more nervous whatever james cantresist you when you look that hot not even the buckets full of pride him and sirius share could stop him just relax and enjoy yourself lily diya said as she fussed with a bit of lily hair the three girls then sat and talked of their final school year whilst watching house elves bustle about and diya parents practice their greetings soon guests began to arrive james straightened his robes nervously for about the fiftieth time as the potters along with sirius and remus arrived at the large wooden door of diya enormous white mansion an ethnic painting graced the doorway and asked them in a low accented voice names fred and margaret potter our son james and his friends sirius black and remus lupin mr potter stated formally yes you seem to be on the list welcome to the chaterjee mansion the painting said as it slid open and allowed entrance look jamesie quit the nervousness just stick with the plan and it ll be alright ok sirius assured his friend patting him on the back or you could talk to her and sort stuff out remus suggested hopefully or not he said after receiving a dirty look from sirius and a befuddled expression from james after politely greeting diya parents who were now in deep conversation with james mum and dad the three boys stood taking in the scene in front of them the party was in full swing the ballroom cluttered with dancing couples with admiring grown ups chatting either sitting or standing at the side the large chandelier occasionally let down a sparkle of moondust and glitter on to the people below who were watching in awe the marble staircase had youngsters either flirting or kissing furiously on many of the steps the large spread of food was at one side of the gigantic room with tasters of indian food along with all other delicacies the chaterjee new year party was obviously a great success hello boys diya greeted them kissing them each on the cheek and pecking remus swiftly on the mouth you lot look well swish tonight she joked laughing easily not bad yourself chaterjee sirius drawled however was scanning the room eagerly you look beautiful di remus complimented in a rather practiced way she was wearing pale periwinkle coloured robes and her hair was sleekly done in an upsweep she grabbed on to his arm and started to lead him away before casually saying over her shoulder oh have fun james a slight teasing tone to her voice oh you too sirius she neednthave told sirius however because he was already grinning as a beautiful young auror had decided to chat him up james sighed as sirius and his new acquaintance flirted ordinarily if he and sirius were at a party james would be flirting twice as much as his friend tonight however his heart just wasntin it a fifth year hufflepuff he vaguely recognised was now talking his ear off but he had tuned her out he gazed around the crowded ballroom when his eyes lingered on the elegant marble staircase the beauty that stood on the staircase however james could not describe lily stood nervously gazing around the room cutely biting her lip she was wearing green robes that had this silvery thing on them she also done her hair different he noticed their eyes met across the room and lily let out a tiny smile he let out a low whistle as he stared back at her his own mouth curving slightly into a small smile of his own oh i know it was so much work were owl years this difficult when you did them james james james the indistinguishable hufflepuff droned on as james sauntered away from her without a second look he approached the staircase nervously all thoughts of sirius plan gone how could he ignore her when she looked like that she glided down the stairs still nervously biting her lip lily you look wow james stuttered unable to find the usually smooth words thanks james she said quietly looking up at him a moment passed as they gazed longingly at each other james broke the silence by rubbing his neck tensely and saying about my last owl forget about it how ve you been she cut in sweetly the two teenagers took a seat on the steps and dove into a great conversation filled with laughs and the occasional flirting until james got up in a rush i could talk like this forever lemme just go get some drinks for us alright he suggested before racing off lily twirled her hair nonchalantly happy with the way things were going they seemed to be starting over it would all work out just then a handsome young healer struck up a conversation with lily beginning with a flirty line she thought before answering james would be back in a moment and things seemed to be working perfectly oh but hang on this would be the perfect opportunity to start executing the plan diya had been talking about in two minds for a split second she decided to follow advice she flipped her long hair casually and flashed a dazzling smile at the man before replying flirtatiously ivana dragged herself away from the tenth guy who d asked her to dance and collapsed into a chair by the refreshment table in the process sitting on someone hand ow ivvy how much d you weigh sirius asked cheekily pulling his hand out from under her sirius ivana laughed and pulled him into a hug her blue robes sparkling like her eyes alright sweetheart he asked grinning as he ruffled her hair affectionately yeh just tired of dancing with ill footed imbeciles is all how about ivana began to ask sirius a question but was rudely interrupted by a voice a little huskier than her own sorry about that babe who you re little friend a woman about twenty years of age had sidled up near sirius and now had her hand on his thigh she was wearing extremely revealing robes and had accessorized with shining diamond jewellery sirius eyes were now wide as he scanned her appreciatively and placed his hand over hers oh carla this is ivana my good friend from school sirius introduced the woman sending ivana a look that could only suggest he was happy he d scored ivana extended her hand briefly to grip the woman limp handshake ivana oh well aintthat just an adorable name what is that bulgarian the american witch drawled looking condescendingly at ivana who was carefully hiding her annoyance russian actually how old are you carla ivana shot at the witch who was now cooing in sirius ear as she licked it gently ivana hid a disgusted look when she did this but sirius seemed to be enjoying it oh what that honey i twenty one this january she answered momentarily moving her mouth away from sirius face her hand however had slid up on sirius lap and he opened his eyes wide grinning madly twenty one hey well d you make it a habit of hitting on 17 year old boys ivana questioned bitingly sirius shot her a warning look which she swiftly ignored the woman looked rather startled at this but answered smoothly well when they look like sirius i make exceptions she then trailed off giving ivana a spiteful look and grabbed a surprised sirius into a deep kiss ivana inwardly seething as sirius slickly responded just rolled her eyes and got up to head to the dance floor maybe she d find someone who was twenty one to snog james returned jovially clutching two gilly waters but stopped short when he saw lily flirting with a blonde wizard she let out a tinkling laugh as she touched him on the arm her eyes then seemed to dart in james direction but she returned to smiling broadly at a joke the guy had just told james fists clenched angrily as the flimsy glasses in his hands crushed and tipped gilly water all over his robes angrily dumping them into the nearest bin he stormed off running headfirst into remus after taking one look at the red faced james remus excused himself from the animated conversation he d been having with arthur and molly weasley and muttered scourigify to james robes which instantly cleaned so what up james any reason you look like a tomato with a body or is that what attractive nowadays remus asked argh moony that girl is impossible i tell you absolutely round the bend out of her mind impossible what did lily do now she arghh well i was having a great conversation with her like and then i go off to get us drinks and when i get back she off flirting with some other fella james face was now turning a bright scarlet as he blinked menacingly around the ballroom only half noting the sexy auror now had her tongue down sirius throat and ivana had stalked away from them angrily rolling her eyes james are you sure look i mean girl are confusing when diya liked me she used to go off and flirt with other guys all the time remus explained fairly yeah but lily isntdiya it not the same speaking of where is your partner in lip locking james asked distractedly oh i dunno she was talking to these two wizards from an indian school a while ago we dontfeel the need to be around each other all the time remus replied a little snootily well sorry james said with a little edge to his voice i off to get wasted then with that he strolled away from an amused looking remus who turned eagerly back to his conversation with the weasleys molly was telling him about their son bill who d recently showed his first signs of magic when he had found himself on the roof after trying to run away from one of arthur mad muggle inventions oh diya i think i really messed up this time i did the whole flirt with another guy routine in front of james and you should ve seen the look on his face he must loathe me lily whined to diya as they exited the bathroom after a heart to heart she wiped her eyes delicately on the tissue alice had given her alice was engaged to frank longbottom in their year and since they d been together from first year she d had her fair share of relationship problems and had understandingly handed lily a tissue no no it supposed to confuse him dontworry look there he is by the bar go on flirt with him a bit more then ignore alright i suppose i d better where are you going remus is over there with the weasleys lily said gesturing towards the werewolf who was now laughing candidly with the red headed man and woman um i talking to these indian lads dad introduced me to rahul and rohan patil me and remus dontfeel the need to be around each other all the time you know diya explained pointedly well sorry i off wish me luck lily joked and head towards the bar to talk to james ivana held a hand against the dancing guy chest as she tried to distance herself from him sure he was cute but his breath smelt worse than the whole quidditch team after a match she pushed him away slightly and turned only to find herself dancing with sirius alright he greeted her draping one arm around her waist as they moved expertly to the music finished tongue wrestling with your ancient auror then ivana asked icily sirius brushed off this hostility with a smirk and said relax ivvy she wasntall that older nah but you were right she was a bit of a try hard so i blew her off ivana couldnthide a grin when she heard this so she simply nodded and moved with sirius as the fast song continued to play soon enough however a girl began to rub up against sirius so he let go of ivana waist and after cheekily throwing her an impish grin and grazed the new girl cheek with his finger lightly immediately she pounced on him and they began kissing again ivana turned away and sighed suddenly not in the mood for dancing this constant visual she was getting was making her feel sick she traipsed off to a chair and settled herself next to andromeda and ted tonks my favourite cousin off being a ladies man is he andromeda winked at ivana knowingly yeh it making me slightly sick to my stomach ivana grinned at sirius cousin why d you have a crush on him ted asked her quite innocently ivana sat there gaping slightly at him not quite knowing what to say irritated at the slight blush that was creeping on to her cheeks andromeda however smacked him lightly love just cos sirius friend is sickened by my cousin public displays of affection doesntmean she fancies him ivana sent her a grateful glance and the three sat in silence watching the girl practically eat sirius face ted thankfully interrupted the awkward silence by bringing up the subject of recent muggle raids lily stood awkwardly behind an unsuspecting james who was now on his second fire whisky hey there stranger you come here often she teased a smile playing on her lips as she tapped him on the shoulder james turned startled but gave her a sad rather blank look before downing the remainder of the glass in one and ordering another unsettled lily tried something else so i ve got a head count of about four women that have got off with sirius what d you reckon unable to stop himself james let out a warm laugh four i up to around six he quite the ladies man when he not at school you know oh well with the choice tonight there no wonder i mean no slytherins asking him out here is there a good thing too a slytherin is just the thing to ruin a great party james chuckled what about ivana the boys haventbeen too shy approaching her either lily exclaimed pointing out ivana who was now being dragged to the dance floor by yet another suitor ah iv was always a popular one with the dancers and the terrible dancers lily put in grinning as the man stepped painfully onto ivana foot oh and have you noticed that remus and diya have actually been detachable tonight james inquired a twinkle in his laughing eyes they detach lily put on an air of fake amazement which led the pair of them to crack up again i glad you came to talk to me lily james said a little shyly as he tucked a stray strand of lily hair behind her ear gently quivering at his touch lily tried desperately not to swoon and think of the next part of diya plan oh ignore that was it oh what yeah lily commented casually flipping her hair over her shoulder and looking away vaguely at something else james looked a little confused for a second and said you wanna dance i d love a chance to dance with the most beautiful girl in the room lily wanted to desperately but kept her cool oh well i suppose if you want to she replied in a bored tone james face now was crumpled into a deep frown well dontdo me any favours evans he shot back angrily downing the newest glass of fire whisky in one gulp he then roughly pushed past her to get up lily looked on in horror as james reacted furiously to her casual demeanour no james wait she called urgently grabbing the sleeve of his robes evans exactly what are you trying to do to me you reject me after i confess my deepest feelings to you then you send me a bloody owl suggesting you re interested then you donteven have the decency to apologise for stringing me along then you flirt with some random bloke after spending the good part of an hour flirting with me then you come and make peace and we have a laugh and to top it off you go all ice woman on me straight after what do you think your e doing james exploded at lily in a loud hiss of a whisper ending with a strangled shout then casting death glares at the curious looks the surrounding people were sending them he stormed off pushing past a bewildered stunned lily roughly as she sadly watched james leave lily couldnthelp but wonder what she d done wrong she d followed all of diya advice she was great with boys what had lily done wrong looking rather lost she idly walked towards diya who was laughing with the patil boys then seeing the look on lily face she sent her a look asking what was wrong lily shook her head and gestured failure to diya the indian girl looked quite shocked and looked hopelessly at lily and started to head towards her lily however shook her head and shrugged and went to go sit down at the bottom of the stairs wanting to be alone for a while diya strode towards remus so they could fill each other in and they both looked sadly at lily remus wanting to comfort his girlfriend sat her down and decided to take a page out of sirius black agenda for tonight sirius was busy kissing another girl by the name of oh well he couldntremember her name but he wasnttoo bothered judging by the way the girl kept whispering sammy into his ear he guessed she didntknow his either so what if he had one night of mindless fun this girl was gorgeous she had blonde hair and blue eyes and reminded him a bit of ivana she wasntas funny or charming as his friend but she was cool enough he however was interrupted by a seething black haired boy pushing past them his glasses askew sirius looked after james a moment as he left the house and went to sit by the pond in diya garden then pulling off the girl he offered her a quick well that was fun umm sara no stephanie no well that was fun and ran after prongs he plopped down next to his friend and stared at the half moon reflected in the water of the pond james was staring in vaguely the same place and was ripping clumps of grass out of the perfect lawn sirius let out a chuckle prongs mate just cos your pissed no need to take it out on the lawn when james didntlaugh sirius continued i mean what did it do to you all it was doing was sitting there being green and stuff and padfoot i hate girls james interrupted sirius babbling sirius tone turned more grave as he said no james you just love one particular girl she been bloody unpredictable all night one minute i loving her and the next minute i want to wring her neck for playing these mind games james exclaimed sighing heavily sirius was thoughtful you didntstick to the ignoringplan did you james james gave him a look chuckling sirius then said cautiously maybe moony was right maybe she just was confused i just dontknow what to do padfoot james huffed and put his head in his hands well i d say maybe this black and potter pride isntreally working out sirius suggested slowly what d you mean i mean maybe sirius black is the one who should keep up the pride maybe james potter should be his kind ol forgiving self with that sirius got up and dusted himself off james was looking at him puzzled so sirius indicated towards the large clock visible even from outside as much as i d love to sit here and feel sorry for you it almost twenty to midnight and i planning on starting the year happy i suggest you do the same mate he then headed to the large doors back inside the ballroom leaving james to tear out some more grass ivana sat consoling a tearful lily oh iv i ve lost him for good now why didntthe plan work she sighed ivana struggled to not raise an eyebrow at this question look lils from what you ve told me you would ve been better off not going with diya plan and doing it your own way those methods may work for diya but let be truthful it not really you oh but iv what am i meant to do now give up i suppose maybe me and james are just not meant to be lily wailed disheartened ivana shook her head no she said firmly try again but this time no tricks no techniques no plans just be honest be you lily nodded and wiped her eyes the two girls then looked up to see sirius making a beeline towards them evans he outside by the pond tearing out every blade of grass in the lawn for the love of merlin please go sirius inclined his head towards the door lily nodded and checked herself in the nearby mirror before heading outside sirius took a seat on the step next to ivana who asked worriedly d you think it ll work out sirius looked on gravely god i hope so remus was excitedly talking to a brilliant auror by the name of rebecca fenswickle when lily grazed past them and headed in the direction james had gone with a new determined look on her face he exchanged looks with diya who was nearby talking to rahul patil about hogwarts and they both smiled hopefully sirius meanwhile had decided to start kissing the girl sitting to the left of him and ivana who had been on his right got up disgustedly and headed to the centre of the dance floor mr chaterjee was now announcing there was just ten minutes until midnight so people who had been all over the mansion were now heading towards the centre ballroom for the upcoming countdown for the new year lily slowly approached james for the third time that night and stood silently directly behind him as he stared fixedly at the water then feeling her presence he turned his head slightly hey stranger lily repeated a fresh wave of anger seemed to come over james as he stood up jerkily however he came straight into contact with the elvin wine lily had been holding which spilt all over his robes he angrily burst out at her oh brilliant evans relax james i ll just do a spell lily said quickly no just forget it alright don t even bother saying sorry he spat erupting with built up frustration lily was now rather frustrated herself sorry ok james i sorry is that what you wanted cantyou see i ve just been trying to make ammends for the huge mistake i made when i said no but if sorry all you really wanted then fine i apologise i sorry i spilled wine on your robes i sorry i ignored you so you d stay interested i sorry i flirted with another boy just to get you jealous i even sorry for telling all the teachers about your pranks in first year sorry i made you think i took you forgranted sorry for every single time i yelled at you i sorry for yelling at you now sorry for not realising that wood wasntthe guy i wanted i sorry for not admitting i have never felt anything more wonderful than kissing you and most of all i sorry that i just didnttell you i loved you when i did i love you james this alarmingly long speech left both teenagers stunned and speechless and silence fell over them as the chant inside the house began 10 9 8 7 remus laughed happily with the surrounding people as they counted down the moon dust and glitter from the chandelier was starting to fall more rapidly and people were now getting into large group hugs or couples were pairing off he grinned as the group of 10 or so people around him huddled together and continued to chant 6 5 4 3 sirius was still making out with his newest girl not even bothering to count down diya was being surrounded into a huge group much like remus and the kept counting down the new year smiles broad on their faces ivana looked around at the four boys she was stan ding with which to kiss at midnight she wondered rather bored 2 1 the whole ballroom erupted into wild cheering of happy new year both remus group and diya group were jumping up and down manically ivana smiled forcedly and turned to lean in to kiss the nearest boy but a strong arm had suddenly grabbed her around the waist and pulled her into a tight embrace after the tight hug ended sirius pulled back and kissed her on the cheek before whispering in her ear you had to be the first person i wished a happy new year ivvy then he smiled and sauntered off to kiss a rather irritated girl to wish her a happy new year second ivana didnteven try to hide the gigantic smile that was on her face 3 james was stepping closer to her he had an intense look on his face following lily huge outburst 2 he had grabbed her rather roughly 1 cupping her face gently in his hand james leaned into lily slinking an arm around her waist as the cheers erupted from inside and loud fireworks set off into the sky to signify the new year james whispered softly i knew it he then kissed her deeply they became the only two people in the world at that moment no people cheering happily inside no greetings of happy new year just two people very much in love caught in a tight passionate embrace the only fireworks that existed to them were the ones going off between their lips in their hearts and deep in their souls after several heart stopping minutes lily broke the kiss her knees were weak as she smiled happily at james knew what she asked softly as their fingers entwined i knew you loved me came the reply i just didntknow it yet lily finished a n well hope you loved it as much as i did well did you review please i hoping to get around 30 reviews in total before i start the next chapter so if u want another

got with remus lupin dontbe a troll diya her best friend i heard sirius black got a girl pregnant and she in love with him sirius had heard enough he climbed onto the table in the grand hall and shouted to the suddenly hushed students yes evans and wood broke up ivana petrova most certainly did not get off with remus lupin because the only girl he was kissing was his girlfriend diya chaterjee james potter is now officially going out with lily evans and sirius black absolutely did not get anyone pregnant now will you all please shut the hell up the room was silent for a few moments and then erupted into excited chatter sirius had sunk into his chair exhaling irritably when professor mcgonagall screamed out black watch your language beside her dumbledore chuckled now sirius thank you for the update but in future please stay off the furniture a smile was playing at his lips as he looked at sirius sternly oh scuse me professor i just thought people ought to get their facts straight i mean you dontsee me making up rumours about you and a charming transfiguration teacher do you he said cheekily knowing that he probably had crossed the line with professor mcgonagall but dumbledore would be inwardly laughing minerva mcgonagall blushed scarlet as the hall laughed dumbledore himself suppressed a laugh but said to sirius sternly mr black that will be enough five points from gryffindor for embarrassing a teacher and a detention hospital wing tonight black mcgonagall burst out oh brilliant see you later poppy sirius answered happily winking at the young nurse who blushed visibly as she tried to look stern james laughed along with the rest of the students and affectionately put an arm around lily sighing contendly padfoot you idiot you could ve gotten into so much trouble remus said clicking his tongue sirius laughed and rolled his eyes whilst looking at lily out of the corner of his eye he knew remus had just said what lily had been itching to but since it had been moony he d taken it more lightly oi jamesie i reckon that gotta be a record back four hours and i ve already landed a detention he announced proudly which gained a subtle roll of the eyes from lily and a grin from james no no sirius remember second year detention within the first hour james exclaimed looking rather pompous lily opened her eyes in horror at this giving him a look lily what seriously what james asked obliviously lily just shook her head and laughed smacking james lightly on the head which caused him if possible to grin even wider that must be the first time lily hit james without the intention of causing serious bodily harm ivana joked then she and diya both gasped dramatically pretending to be impressed before falling into giggles james was smiling at looking at lily who purposely avoided his stare as she turned red then suddenly his face clouded with concern quidditch everyone looked at him like he was mad yes james quidditch it a game four chasers a quaffle snitc remus began boredly no shut up moony sirius quidditch james cut him off urgently oho yeah mate i heard you the first time get your arse up and to the pitch james shouted getting up hurriedly but james it our morning off sirius complained weakly sadly deserting the fruit on his plate right happy new year everyone time for some practice ok i thought a lot this holiday and i think we need to sort out our arrangements the chaser formation will stay the same foster matthews get up there and start passing to each other i ll be there in a second now kingston i sincerely hope you ve sorted out your seeking not to be rude but the only reason we avoided losing to hufflepuff was when their seeker fell off her broom and in an attempt to play the hero you practically swallowed the snitch yeah cos that not rude sirius said under his breath rolling his eyes and james obsession with the sport as the gryffindor seeker cheeks grew warm ok and wood i gonna have to ask that sirius does the beating for cassie cos i canthave my keeper boyfriend distracting her fair fair enough wood muttered throwing cassie a wink and a smirk ok then team let go james said pushing off rising into the air to conduct practice he smiled because the team seemed to be in high spirits sooo cassandra murtleback you and wood sirius said funnily as the two players practiced together a bit away from the rest of the team um oh yeah cassie told her friend giggling she and sirius got along extremely well because james recently placed them together in an attempt to un distract wood ok um siri i just dying to get this out but you canttell a soul ok promise sirius eager for something interesting in the rather dull practice agreed quickly well at christmas david he well he asked me to marry him she burst out happily sirius looked at her rather shocked but also impressed wow that was fast congrats cass he replied warmly i so in love she said floating dreamily for a moment but quickly regaining her concentration as james flew close holding the quaffle sirius was amused so much love around he looked over at the stands where lily sat eagerly watching her boyfriend whilst remus and diya did what they did best he then laughed sarcastically to himself at the thought of love yes the blacks had installed more of their influence than they thought ivana ran her fingers boredly through her hair as lily attempted to teach diya the newest defence against the dark arts portion peter pettigrew sat nearby rubbing his arm and glancing around jerkily remus was reading a book for transfiguration and absently sending red sparks into the air as he twirled his wand even james seemed to be studying lying on his stomach with his book open to the same defence portion as lily and diya suddenly the extremely dull silence was broken by a very hyper sirius black he bounded into the common room saying over his shoulder well poppy my dear as long as you re fine walking back on your own he grinned broadly as he approached his friends but suddenly his face fell ivana looked up interested sirius eyes narrowed as he stared at james james potter how dare you how dare i what padfoot james asked rolling onto his back and propping himself up as he looked at sirius study he said exasperatedly as if james ought to have known he then plopped himself in front of ivana and leaned back on her legs this drew smirks from lily and diya as they glanced at ivana who just rolled her eyes and shook her head violently as if to assure them that she and sirius were just friends what topic are you learning anyway sirius asked not really that interested james looked uncomfortable as he willed lily not to answer she however didntnotice and took the opportunity to talk friendlily to sirius saying oh the unforgivables we were just discussing which would be the best one to have on you if in a life threatening situation diya said imperious and i thought possibly cruciatius and james was just about to say i d rather not think about it james interrupted abruptly lily looked at him a bit puzzled but then turned to see the expression on sirius face she gulped remembering sirius tone last time she d mentioned an unforgivable curse what your reasoning behind wanting the cruciatius then sirius asked quietly his hyperness abandoned um well the way i see it atleast you re still alive you know with the imperious you ve sorta lost all your sense of self haventyou cos your possessed in a way atleast with crucio eventually you know you might be able to pull out of it lily explained hesitantly sirius looked impressed for a moment but his expression soon clouded over i guess that what you d gather from a textbook it d have to be avada kedavra for me he said his voice still uncharacteristically quiet ivana took in a sharp breath and remus and james looked up sadly diya closed her eyes trying desperately not to imagine it and peter winced unconsciously rubbing his arm lily looked nervous you d rather die she asked squeakily than endure all that pain sure sirius answered getting up his face was unreadable as he retreated to the dormitories the tension in the air lifted as he left but the expression on lily face was still thoroughly depressed she shot a look at james and stated desperately he really does hate me james could only look hopelessly at remus before turning to lily and shrugging authors note as my absolute fave tennis player andbiggest obsessionof all time andy roddick just got eliminated from the us open in the first round i have updated twice to try and get myself less depressed i just love him so much he deserved to win it and prove to people he still a champion next year he ll win a grand slam i sure anyway here the next chapter and gooo roddick an encounter with evil hogsmeade was a little awkward that day in late january as the seven friends sat together at the three broomsticks james had his arm draped around lily shoulders and they sat opposite remus and diya who had their fingers entwined sirius sat beside them with his arms folded not partaking in the halting conversation at the table peter was next to him looking worriedly at sirius who was opposite ivana looking uncomfortable sending side glances towards lily and then at sirius ahh i canttake this anymore james burst out padfoot you re my best mate would it really hurt to try to at least be friends with my girlfriend hey who said i wasnttrying sirius said putting his hands up defensively sirius not giving me glares and not speaking to me maliciously doesntexactly make us friends lily exclaimed in a quiet pleading voice well it all i have to give at the moment ok i dontget why you re pushing this sirius said angrily staring at her she looked extremely hurt as she broke the glare and stared at the table james lifted his arm off her shoulders and spoke indignantly to sirius you never even gave her a chance sirius she just wants to talk so you guys can sort things out and you wonteven listen i know why you started off being mad i just dontget why you wontlet her redeem herself man the look on sirius face visibly softened he looked rather ashamed as he too took to staring at the table it seems to me sirius you ve held a grudge longer than you wanted to that not like you ivana said in her clear gentle voice give her a chance sirius he looked into her earnest blue eyes and immediately knew he was being an ass his glance then fell on james who looked entirely destroyed by the whole situation sighing he then spoke to lily alright evans i admit i ve been unfair i guess we should talk go for a walk with me lily lifted her head and nodded then casting a nervous glance at james who reassuringly squeezed her hand she followed sirius as he stalked out of the tavern the remaining people exchanged worried looks and tried to change the subject i gonna be fair now evans cos i guess i haventbeen up until now they stood around the side door of the tavern in a slightly dark alley under the lighted lamp post sirius shivered a little in the cold pulling his jacket tightly around himself as he leaned back against a wall and looked at her well look i know you haventexactly warmed to me i mean this year we sort of haventgotten along i suppose it all started the first time we were in hogsmeade i obviously said something which upset you and i mean i didnteven know what james and remus will only go so far as to say you re complicated so so maybe you can clear things up for me lily asked rather scared at the hot tempered boy response she nervously played with her scarf which was gagging her slightly between all the bundles of layers to keep her warm sirius sighed heavily evans i wasntso much mad at you to begin with just sorta disappointed the cruciatius curse isntexactly something to joke about you know and i mean i guess i thought you had a little more sense but sirius i i know its nothing funny but you know sometimes people say things joke about things it doesntmean i think the curse is a laughing matter that just it you didntunderstand what you were talking about but you kept right at it sirius felt his temper rise slowly i sorry i really am i just didntknow you d take it so hard i mean you dontusually take anything seriously she said quickly trying to undo her slip sirius nodded and calmed down a little then he took a deep breath look evans its just cos he stopped mid sentence and straightened up he looked suspiciously toward the darkness of the alleyway lily was confused he was about to tell her something properly she had sensed it what she asked puzzled shhh sirius held a finger to his lips as her held out an arm in front of her defensively he then walked a few inches forward before asking sharply who there show yourselves the two figures lowered the hoods of their black cloaks and approached sirius and lily from the darkness into the dim light death eaters lily gasped sirius nodded briefly keeping his eyes fixed on the stone cold grey eyes of lucius malfoy and piercing blue ones ofrudolphus lestrange stepping protectively in front of lily he spoke calmly to the threatening men hello cousins lucius looked at sirius strangely for a moment and then looked questioningly towards rudolphus whilst starting to lower his wand but his fellow death eater lifted a hand to indicate him to keep it raised cousin i think you lost the right to call us that when you became a filthy blood traitor not even our wives will call you that despite unfortunately sharing your blood he said in a rough tone a lightbulb flicked on in lucius head and his face visibly regained its cool smoothing his long blonde almost white hair back he raised his eyebrows and smirked ah sirius we meet at last narcissa has told me soo little about you he laughed at his own joke as he looked disgustedly at sirius who was rolling his eyes oh lucius i frankly would ve been worried if anyone from my family had said more about me than calling me a dirty muggle lover sirius retorted clenching his fists at his side and slipping one arm into his robes to touch his wand seeing this motion lily reached for her own wand shakily thoughts were racing worriedly around in her head when she had been scared to go talk to sirius outside she d never imagined just how scared she end up and it wasntsirius who was scaring her he was protecting her her heart wrenched as she realised what a good person sirius actually was he would defend her despite disliking her but she was good with hexes she could help oh oh no little girl i dontthink you should be doing that rudolphus said now pointing his wand directly at lily she was frightened however she lifted her head bravely moving to raise her wand no lily don t sirius whispered urgently to her seeing the slight panic in sirius eyes as he looked at her she obliged instantly trusting him ah there a good little mudblood she winced at the insult and looked up angrily reacting to her expression lucius was now starting to speak stu he began before being cut off no sirius yelled stepping in front of her fully leave her out of this you know you didntcome here for her ah but killing a pretty mudblood whilst delivering the dark lord bidding couldnthurt my name is lily you snake lily burst her gryffindor courage taking the best of her evans sirius insisted hastily lily evans we ll be remembering you lucius sneered before nudging rudolphus hurry up very well lucius sirius black the dark lord has a proposition for you despite news of your betrayal of blood he sees you as a prime candidate for his inner circle pure blood of course being the prime necessity and so far he has been pleased with your brother loyalty make the right choice now sirius and you may just live to see your first born child the dark lord is a powerful ally to have when he is making decisions on who shall live and who shall die lily gasped her mouth wide open and blurted out sirius you can t he s he a monster sirius you re good sirius who had remained quiet through this all was in two minds for a split second the black in him was starting to submerge despite him desperately trying to force it out but when he heard lily utter the word good he made the decision he wanted to make voldemort will just have to handle rejection for once he said simply staring daggers at the two death eaters in front of him taking in the sigh of relief lily had quietly let out lucius looked furious as his eyes gleamed fiery lestrange let out a spine chilling chuckle however oh how very noble of you how dare you speak his name you piece of filth malfoy spat angrily ready to lunge at sirius now now lucius why get our fists dirty in a fight when we have such a wonderful curse up our sleeve rudolphus grinned evilly and raised his wand towards sirius who had now pulled out his own wand malfoy eyes glinted madly as the two other men started throwing jinxes at each other sirius was continually dodging the cruciatius curse however was not using any unforgivables as he fought lestrange lucius now approached lily who had drawn her wand biting her lip to not betray an expression of fright foolish foolish little mudblood crucio he yelled as she had distractedly glanced at sirius who had yelled with pain as lestrange hit him with theunforgivable curse lily fell to her knees screaming and thriving with pain her wand fell from her hand as she shook and thrashed about being tortured he smiled as tears leaked from her eyes however suddenly a fist had connected with his face as sirius punched him hard he released the spell and wiped blood from his mouth he looked dazedly at his fellow death eater who was now crawling around on the floor wandless expelliarmus sirius bellowed and lucius wand flew to his hand which was already holding rudolphus defeated lucius grabbed his friend and apparated away with a slight pop bloody cowards sirius muttered angrily before rushing towards lily he snapped the wands in his hand in half in one deft motion silently he perversely thanked his family for having enforced the unforgivable curse on him so many times he felt almost immune to the pain but not quite he had been lucky to break rudolphus concentration to stop the curse breathing hard he staggered towards lily who was lying unconscious on the ground he knelt by her side clutching an open wound on his arm he carefully touched her neck to check her pulse it was slowly regaining it usual pace as she fluttered her eyes open oh sirius she croaked hopelessly dontworry lily you re alright how did you it was killing me how could you bear the pain sirius she asked her voice weak and desperate when i said you didntknow how it felt evans i never meant for you to actually experience it sirius whispered quietly you mean you ve felt it before oh sirius i so sorry she was trying to pull herself up as she spoke suddenly understanding sirius laid a hand on her shoulder easing her back down lily no i sorry i could ve should ve protected you james ll kill me no he won t he ll thank you thank you sirius she cried silently as she hugged him not knowing what to say he returned her hug rubbing her back soothingly they became friends after that there are some things which happen which bring two people closer and facing a pair of death eater unforgivable curses is one of them a n i updated twice come on please if you re enjoying this review if you didntlike something tell me review oh and any suggestions for next chapters are completleyy welcome please review authors note i so glad you all like the story i might not be able to update for a weekish after this chapter cos school is starting but please continue to review and give me any suggestions thanks to padfootobsessed329 galadh ginny rox my sox01 lotrcute16 for reviewing queen of duct tape ahh i glad you picked up on the subliminal messages to review much apprieciation for your usual hilariousness and the great compliments nick i keeping your suggestion in mind for a future chapter this story is gonna go til sirius is in azkaban so i ll throw your idea in somewhere for sure thanks the order and the one line valentines card professor i telling you i can identify them name colour of hair wife even wand type sirius yelled frustrated at the headmaster dumbledore remained quiet and nodded patiently i know mr black you have shown me the remains of their wands however i cannot go to the ministry with this sirius looked ready to throw something why not professor these death eaters attacked my best friend and my girlf um lily james added gesturing wildly again dumbledore nodded and opened his mouth to speak yes i believe you however i still cannot please professor lily began politely despite cutting him off how come we have more than enough proof if they dontbelieve the wands or the bruises on my body then surely sirius wounds will be enough albus dumbledore sadly shook his head ah my dear i can only wish the ministry took such things as seriously as i however unfortunately the minister will not take the word of two seventeen year olds seriously despite the fact you are now of age lily nodded sadly and james looked annoyed but fell quiet sirius looked as though he may burst but instead he angrily let out a sharp breath and sank into the chair next to remus who patted his back this information will go to perhaps a more competent source dumbledore said seriously please professor what could be more competent than the ministry remus asked dumbledore stood and began pacing in front of the seven teenagers well wonderful as the ministry are he paused his eyes carrying a small amount of sarcasm which the students duly noted the issue of lord voldemort does not seem to be on the top of their priorities not at the top but professor people are dying everyday diya put in indignantly however it was not the headmaster who answered her they want to believe it not true and with no concrete proof as of yet they re able to delude themselves for as long as possible ivana explained quietly as the others looked at her strangely and professor dumbledore nodded his head in impressed agreement ivana eyes went a little stormy when in russia the government did the same thing at this her accent became slightly stronger and her hand clenched the armrest uncomfortably dumbledore smiled at her reassuringly so she relaxed a little he then continued miss petrova happens to sadly correct governments have so often made such mistakes it is for this reason a society has been set up the order of the phoenix is dedicated to bringing down lord voldemort and his followers this information i assure you miss evans mr black will be put to extreme good use each time the name voldemort came up the teenagers seemed to visibly flinch ivana hand was shaking slightly until sirius reassuringly placed his hand over it she looked at him quickly however his expression was still fixed on dumbledore as he nodded determinedly lily was now leaning on james exhaustedly as he stroked her hair absently a similar look of determination on his face remus was unknowingly twirling his wand as he nervously passed it from hand to hand and diya was looking dazedly at dumbledore bird fawkes pettigrew was squirming in his seat and unconsciously rubbing his arm dumbledore seeing lily saturated figure rubbed his hands together and said alright miss evans mr black i shall escort you to the hospital wing his expression was kind and gentle yet james could see his mind was wandering he carefully supported lily as they walked through the door everyone else please go back to your common rooms you shall hear from your friends soon mr potter he added as james watched worriedly then stopping he turned around and saw sirius still sitting in his chair the others looked from lily to sirius and exchanged concerned looks on second thought james please escort lily to the hospital wing everyone else please return to your common room i wish to have a word with sirius hurry now james we shall join you shortly remus quickly grabbed diya and ivana hands and ushered them out throwing a nervous look at sirius peter scuffled after them and james supporting lily in his arms headed to the hospital wing professor dumbledore closed the door behind him as he sat beside sirius however remained silent allowing the confused boy to talk first sirius bit his lip and looked away for a moment before stammering in a weak voice professor i could ve gotten her killed i it would ve been my fault no sirius you were extremely brave defending miss evans the way you did you should understand however not to put so much weight on your shoulders i find that you and mr potter seem to share this characteristic it is not a bad one of course but simply unnecessary sirius looked at him rather unsurely lily is an extremely gifted witch sirius and though protecting her is indeed noble you must give her more credit she well brave i never would ve thought it b but the first time i had the cruciatius on me sir i i didnthandle it nearly as well sirius conceded looking rather ashamed sirius having the curse on you is bad enough but now look to your situation you had the curse placed on you as a young child by someone who was meant to love you love professor i cantfeel love i donteven know how to love sirius said harshly looking away his eyes stony then what do you feel for james sirius or remus or ivana your friend peter and even two girls who at first you disliked oh yes sirius you can love dumbledore put in wisely i not like them though professor sure i care and that but i just nevermind sir d you reckon i should go to miss pomfrey to fix up my arm sirius inquired changing the subject the headmaster remained quiet a moment as if contemplating whether to push the subject or not in the end he decided against it and said smiling oh heavens no boy i honestly worry about you and poppy i think madam hobbleskin the older nurse at the time would be a far better choice his eyes were twinkling as he beamed at sirius who smirked back aww professor but a young mediwitch would make me feel so much better so much quicker he complained laughing putting on a cheeky pout i daresay she would mr black dumbledore laughed helping sirius up it was mid february and the rumours about lily and sirius encounter with the death eaters had finally settled down the conversation had soon turned to valentines day as girls were rushing to send off their cards and boys quickly bought presents for their girlfriends lily and diya left the marauders in search of ivana as they d gotten bored of the constant discussion of quiddtich they found her in the dormitories writing something at one of the desks what up iv diya said plopping on the bed ivana slipped her letter into an envelope and turned to face them oh not much i just wasntup for james usual throw by throw account on how puddlemere did in the last quidditch league match she answered laughing suddenly a worried look appeared on lily smiling face oh crappers i ve forgotten to get him anything for valentines and it tomorrow ivana laughed and rolled her eyes where as diya shared her look of worry oh i ve already got remus that new book on grims which he been dying to read a silver bracelet and not to mention half of honeydukes she grinned at her perfect present ahhh what do i do oh i know get him heart shaped chocolate oh oh no a picture of you and him in a locket noo a bracelet which has l and j engraved in it she said excitedly lily looked thoughtful whereas ivana opened her eyes in disgust urghh diya no lily think logically he is a bloke after all and i sure you know he wouldntlike any of those presents you should come up with something yourself she exploded exasperatedly lily nodded um no offence di but last time i took your advice it sorta didntgo so well diya merely sniffed at this and continued to wrap her presents for remus lily sat thoughtfully james didntmuch like valentines day so this would be difficult suddenly her face lit up and she described her idea to her two friends diya agreed and ivana howled with laughter lily went to consult her charms book with a grin on her face downstairs the marauders were discussing the same thing what you get diya moony sirius asked as he stretched lazily chocolate necklace and flowers remus listed what you get lily prongs sirius repeated to james oh i kinda got her something well cheesy i got her this emerald ring with l j engraved in it and the date we started going out i know she likes that kinda stuff i just hope she doesntget me something similar james said cringing waahahahaha imagine prongsie wearing a bracelet with l and j and hearts all over it ahhh priceless i must go tip off lily sirius laughed pretending to get up remus was also laughing and peter smiled not sure which of his friends to support shut upp padfoot you git james exclaimed blushing slightly as he pulled sirius back down what about you get anything for your dear friend ivana petrova or should i say mrs black why jamesie i would never buy my mother flowers sirius answered in a mock offended tone remus and james laughed you know what he meant padfoot get ivana anything sirius rolled his eyes and shook his head uh no we re just friends you idiots just cos you two are dating her friends doesntmean we re gonna go out too sure sirius cos you dontlike her james teased i don t sirius said seriously a n it had to come up eventually haha couldntthink of another adjective oh ok james said looking rather disappointed the next morning at breakfast the excitement could not be with held by all the girls when owls began to fly in the squeals were heard throughout the grand hall james and sirius snickered at each other rolling their eyes at this ridiculous holiday remus looked around rather tiredly but smiled when diya squealed and kissed him after opening her present she promptly crumpled up the other cards she had received and sat beaming as remus thanked her for his gift and shifted away the few others he d received ivana pile of cards was being lazily opened by the amused russian girl who smiled at each boy she d received a gift from she then neatly bunched all the various flowers together with a binding spell and started laughing at sirius who was steadily disappearing behind the enormous pile of cards landing in front of him on the table prongs save me he yelled before the cards tumbled on to him james however was busy with lily who was kissing him furiously after taking one look at her gift she then smiled slyly at james who was looking at her apprehensively hoping silently her gift would not be cheesy well james since i know you hate valentines so much and all i figured i d do something which would make you laugh instead she said her voice trailing off as she twirled her wand and his robes they instantly flashed and huge headlines now covered them they said property of lily evans girls back off the girls surrounding them who had sent james cards scowled and reluctantly summoned their cards back james let out a huge bellow of laughter and hugged lily ah i knew i d rub off on you eventually he said affectionately kissing her nose sirius who had finally clambered back out of the pile of letter made puking noises and rolled his eyes at this gesture james and lily laughed and looked at him as he began reading the notes and started laughing get anything good sirius lily asked hahaha these are priceless honestly what a joke look at this one he said tossing a long sheet of pink parchment at his friends it read your eyes like cauldrons your lips like roses your hair like coal your laugh like gold your smile so dazzling your nice it frazzling and it seemed to go on and on rhyming terribly with an ode to sirius he didntseem to notice the girl polly nearby who was blushing embarrassedly as he read some aloud between hysterical chuckles he continued through the pile reading only the first few lines of each enormously long love letter tiredly he then saw a small blue envelope oh look it a short one he said as he opened it quickly his laugh then trailed off as he looked around the note had one single line on it which stuck in his mind because no one else makes my heart beat as fast the note said simply on pale blue paper withminimal black writing on it what does it say padfoot remus asked laughing sirius looked up rather flustered his face had started to uncharacteristically blush who d sent him that note it was so much more special to himthan all the miles and miles of parchment he d already read oh nothing just the usual ode he answered quickly letting out a chuckle he then let out a huge irritated sigh as another owl dropped a stack full of cards on the table waving his wand in one quick motion he vanished all the gifts and grinned at his friends ivana however saw him casually slip the blue note into his pocket and take a quick look around a n please review i ll update if my total reviews reach around 50 otherwise it ll probably take a while thanks for reading author note i was procrastinating rather than finishing my homework so i wrote this you reviewers are just too damn nice it makes me wanna update thanks to animerocksjapanrocks rigelorion ange as always with your flattering comments you ll spoil me nick because no one ever been stunned by my work means a lot padfootobsessed329 for pointing out my fave parts of the last chapter as her fave parts thank you ok please read and review if you just read and not review how will i know if u like it or not cries the death of mr black james remus and peter were talking in hushed whispers to the three girls at breakfast a week later when sirius approached the table slightly later and slumped sleepily in his seat the whispering halted into an uncomfortable silence who died sirius asked rubbing his eyes puzzled by the sudden quiet lily bit her lip uncomfortably and after shooting a look at james she pushed the mornings daily prophet across the table to sirius rather boredly he looked at the headline and then raised an eyebrow at lily auror training will be lengthened in the first year of the 80 s sirius laughed at his friends dontworry guys it doesntaffect us you can all still become aurors after one year of training not three they all looked rather shiftily at each other as they squirmed in their seats uh no mate the article next to that james pointed not meeting his friend eyes after raising his eyebrow again sirius glanced down at the article and took in an unaudible tight breath it read arcturus gacrux black dies age 61 london arcturus black a highly influential member of the board until last year passed away in his home yesterday due to an expected heart failure it is said he was suffering from the illness for the past few years repeatedly however refused to obtain medical care from the healers at s the daily prophet visited the black mansion at grimmauld place to offer our condolences and talk with black wife capella he went in a very dignified manner capella black 47 revealed i one hundred percent stand by my husband decision to forgo care from that establishment the proper care he needed could not have come from anyone other than a supreme pure blood healer which much to our distaste is rare nowadays arcturus bravely chose the correct path and my respect and honour of my husband shall live on regulus black 16 the younger son of arcturus and capella was deeply saddened by his father passing and told us he was immensely proud of his father and is sure his father would continually be proud of him the black older son sirius 17 was unavailable for comment as he was not informed of his father death sirius is no longer part of this family cappella conceded rather stiffly sirius black left home at the age of 16 and was disowned late last year he is the first of the black to place outside the hogwarts house slytherin instead to gryffindor the black inheritance has recently been shifted to regulus name before his older brother prophet there were three pictures accompanying the article one of sirius father with piercing blue eyes and black silky hair sirius and regulus obviously resembled him more however like the younger back because he was scowling up at them and sniffing in an overly dignified manner at lily another held the black family crest which shone proudly on the page the last was a picture of cappella with her two sons however there was a visible burn in the photograph where someone had obviously tried to burn off sirius face in the photo his mother and brother were standing to the side looking at sirius who had dodged the burn marks and was now smirking at them whilst leaning against the frame sirius flopped back in his chair he was quite unsure of how to feel his father was dead but he hated his father he glanced at regulus sitting at the slytherin table rather quietly as narcissa whispered to him although the signature hardness in his eyes remained he seemed rather lost instantly sirius felt a touch of pity after all his parents had always loved and treated regulus with far more respect he was their good son so it was more natural for him to feel grief sirius are you alright lily asked concernedly sirius turned to smile at her and nodded yeah lils i hated him it just strange he said rather distantly james clapped him on the back reassuringly but sirius got up um i have to check on something he mumbled vaguely as he saw regulus leave the hall he followed him alright reg sirius inquired using the nickname they had used as young children when they had gotten along oh hello brother regulus muttered with a distant look i sorry man sirius said pitying his distraught family member regulus glanced up at sirius with a slightly softened expression in his eyes sirius was alarmed to see the emotion in them for a moment until a realisation seemed to hit the younger boy are you father would be sickened he spat maliciously his eyes turning icy look reg it ok to be upset i mean he was our dad after all sirius tried patiently my father he retorted possessively was a noble man he would be proud to see me now he would not want my grief and most definitely not yours you you blood traitor sirius own eyes hardened oh not to worry how could i possibly feel grief for someone like that man regulus perhaps i was wrong to think you may need some support as of now you were wrong as if i need i need your help not when i have the support of the the dar regulus was stammering now his usual icy demeanour diminishing sirius felt another rush of pity and stepped closer to him get away from me you ll get what you deserve one day sirius and then i and the entire black regime will laugh regulus yelled angrily before swishing off to the dungeons sirius leaned weakly against the wall his body shaking with anger his eyes now mirrored those of his brother as he d stared one last time at him the last drop of compassion he felt for his sibling evaporated instantly in that moment sirius forgot all the years he and regulus had been two friendly brothers it had only changed the year regulus arrived at hogwarts and was placed in slytherin only then did the true hatred begin sighing sirius forgot about his brother and trudged off to arithmancy the next day was the latest hogsmeade trip and sirius spirits seem to have risen whilst the girls were shopping the four marauders went for a walk so sirius you haventhad a girlfriend since new year trying to prove a point or something james laughed teasingly i think he just wants to pretend he not in love with ivana you know to make a stand remus agreed also grinning sirius rolled his eyes oh my god do you guys ever quit i am not in love with ivana for the fiftieth time and how exactly is that taking a stand rem oh cos you dontwanna be cheesy and go out with our girlfriends best friend james put in slyly winking at remus ahhh you guys are such morons look if i had feelings for ivana i would ve confronted her by now we re open about those kinda things friends remember sure remus grinned even wider ok ok ok sirius exploded fine i actually do have my eye on someone but it not petrova and well you cantlaugh ok course not sirius peter piped in sure mate remus added would i laugh at you padfoot james said still laughing which earned him yet another roll of the eyes from sirius who sarcastically said course not prongs he then looked at them rather embarrassedly and pulled a blue note out of his pocket it was folded several times and looked as though it had been read repeatedly hey i was wondering why you kept reading that blue thing before you went to bed every night remus exclaimed eagerly you saw me sirius asked turning red james had now grabbed the note from sirius vulnerable grip and read it grinning madly because no one makes my heart beat as fast he read out loud he then paused and exchanged looks with remus before dissolving into uncontrollable laughter i i i cantbelieve you keep that in your pocket all the time he choked out between laughs slapping his thigh as he doubled over remus was as red in the face as sirius but as apposed to being embarrassed it was because he was trying very hard to control his bursts of laughter peter was laughing shortly along with james looking a little lost ok ok great so now you ve had your fun sirius grumbled snatching back the note and smoothing it out before slipping it back in his pocket no no padfoot tell us go on james urged trying to control his laughter who heart beats fast every time they see you at this he burst again into laughter and held his aching sides and sirius narrowed his eyes at him remus being the first to regain control spoke to sirius apologetically honestly mate we re sorry it just unusual seeing you all embarrassed about a love note he said biting his lip to keep from chuckling again yeah yeah shut the hell up prongs sirius said irritated look laugh it up all you want but i like it and i gonna find the girl who wrote it his very own cinderella james said nudging remus who chuckled james knew some muggle stories whereas sirius and peter looked completely confused at this cindy who peter questioned sirius no idea mate prongs is just trying to be clever he answered glaring at a still laughing but apologetic james sorry sirius mate james said draping an arm around his resentful friend cos i not sure i ll be able to help you find your mystery girl at this he took of running with sirius hot on his tail acting annoyed though he was now laughing as they chased each other the girls approached an amused remus and peter and laughed along at the two best friends and to think i thought he d grown up lily joked and then waved as james yelled out to her as he ran backwards oi hex him for me lils but suddenly he had ran backwards into a beautiful woman with waist length silvery blonde hair oh sorry ma am james apologised turning around but then stopping short sirius voice greeted the woman who had an ugly sneer on her beautiful face hello mother capella black stepped backwards away from james who was now frowning as he too retreated the group had now gathered near sirius who had met his mother eyes with a cool stare the shared the same hard greyness as his mother who nodded in a dignified manner to this respectful greeting son she responded rather sarcastically sirius suddenly looked a little nervous as he scuffed his shoe on the floor and rubbed the back of his neck this surprised the others slightly as sirius never spoke of his mother respectfully um my condolences for the loss he said rather politely but staring at the floor stand up straight boy mrs black snapped at him immediately he stood up straight but his eyes now carried more fire there is no need for condolences your father was a great man so i ve been told sirius muttered angrily under his breath excuse me how dare you she snapped reaching inside her robes oh mother dontmake me hex you sirius said playfully however had a serious edge to his tone as he whipped out his own wand mrs black expression was shocked as she stared at her son the boys exchanged uncomfortable glances and the girls audibly gasped always the ungrateful one werentyou boy mrs black said shrilly as she regained her emotionless stare lucky it was in my nature to be rebellious eh sirius had an arrogant smirk and the respect he had greeted his mother with had obviously abandoned him otherwise i might ve ended up like my brat of a brother regulus has made us proud i only wish you were even a little bit like your brother what and be in league with an insane dark lord his tone was threatening now as he challenged his mother who merely sneered i completely support regulus decision this dark lord obviously has the correct approach in wanting to rid the world of these mudbloods and filty half bloods his mother countered coolly throwing a disgusted look at sirius friends sirius angrily brandished his wand and stepped closer to her mother you have no right to insult my friends he rasped dangerously and you have no right to call me mother goodbye sirius do send my worst to the rest of the potters especially margaret i do believe she the size of an elephant now she smirked at james who clenched his fists angrily but said nothing sirius however looked as though he was going to lunge at his mother so remus and james each grabbed an arm restraining him as he tried to raise his wand oh sirius dontbe ludicrous put that away you have not the dare to hex your own flesh i however have no problem with this remark she looked around hastily and aimed a quick crucio at sirius who winced then cackling she turned and walked off next time just try me sirius yelled out angrily as his friends held him back she slowly turned and smirked at him before walking off why the ruddy hell did you stop me sirius exploded as james and remus let go this was met with no answer sirius stood breathing heavily bursting with anger he blinked menacingly at his friends who all surrounded him quietly the girls had their hands clasped over their mouths in shock after another crazed look around he pushed past them roughly and stalked towards the castle a n read and review guys you know you want to grins no wait sirius wants you to a n this chapter got re written about 10 times but i finally happy with it hope you are too thanks to my reviewers nick queen of duct tape padfootobsessed329 animerocksjapanrocks and johnmayer1207 please do so again enjoy the best man bridesmaid solves his mystery sirius was sitting sulkily with his friends in the common room they had about thirty minutes left of their free period before heading off to lessons he had arithmancy his most boring lesson and the only one of his close friends in the class was lily however he didntsit next to her because at the beginning of the year they werentexactly friends he knew he wouldntbe able to keep his eyes open in the lesson if he didntget hyper now so he started to annoy remus he looked away casually and then quickly smacked his friend on the head before looking away as if he d done nothing remus glanced at him and rolled his eyes very mature padfoot what i didntdo anything sirius exclaimed childishly which gained him another eye roll as remus looked back at his book sirius repeated his irritating smack on the head and looked away remus took a deep breath and ignored him getting bored with remus lack of response sirius kicked james padfoot i have like another foot to write in twenty minutes so please annoy someone else james sighed and used his wand to erase yet another bad sentence lilyy help me lily for once had a free lesson with them because ancient runes had been cancelled her timetable was ridiculously full so she could only spend meal times with james ordinarily she laughed and rumpled his hair affectionately you idiot i donttake muggle studies james looked at her as if she was mad lily your parents are muggles come on please i donteven understand how a washing machine works its useless trying to write an essay on it sighing lily pulled his paper towards her and read through it trying not to laugh at some of his theories james um i not sure you can just say a washing machine runs on elektrepacy in ten different ways using ten different sentences oh it electricity by the way alec what sirius asked not really caring he then started to ball up pieces of parchment and used ivana large care of magical creatures textbook to smack them at peter as if they were bludgers peter was getting very annoyed as he himself had an essay to write on hippogriffs but sirius being too bored to care kept hitting them at him when peter finally got the courage to send him a death glare sirius decided to hit one at diya who was looking at remus vaguely but seemed to be in rather deep thought sirius will you please stop that here read this if you re that bored diya yelled tossing a copy of witch weekly at him they had another ten minutes of silence from sirius as ivana randomly sketched lily and james who were sitting in front of her bickering over his essay i can too say washing machines are useless james argued not to muggles they re not james lily said frustrated well why cantthey just what invent some way of making a spell like scourgify i spose lily cut in sarcastically it d be useful you have to admit james laughed cheekily idiot lily smacked him lightly on the head and laughed before changing his final paragraph from in my opinion washing machines are useless and rubbish and muggles should have thought of something cooler using electepasy instead of justa large box with a rolling ball inside to although the use of electricity and washing machines should be commended in my opinion despite their best efforts muggles are still at a serious disadvantage perhaps it would be useful to think of a more advanced mechanism for the future wow thanks lils aww but are you sure i cantkeep the large box with a rolling ball inside thing it more potter like lily rolled her eyes but changed the last part of the sentence to james way more idiot like you mean she said playfully before james grabbed her and started tickling her ivana laughed at them and crumpled up her sketch she got up to stretch and see what remus and diya were talking about when sirius burst after finishing the article wow that was amazing he shouted excitedly diya i really enjoyed that story how do i tell the writer that i loved it diya grinned and said oh well basically you just review their work and send them a message right diya you read it too write a review as well with that sirius wrote a long note and grabbed diya shorter review and sent them to the owl postal address the article had referred to then he dragged lily away from a sulky james and they walked to arthimancy james remus and diya headed to muggle studies and ivana rushed off to care of magical creatures with peter tagging along behind her the muggle studies teacher professor kinde herte began reading through their essays as the class sat in group discussions this lesson they were discussing muggle money so diya wasntworried for once when she was split into a different group from remus and james since her parents owned a bank she d been taught about muggle money a long time ago so she quickly gave her opinion and then decided to gaze at remus whilst the others in her group tried in vain to understand the conversion charts in front of them diya sighed as she looked dreamily at her boyfriend who was confusedly talking with his group about conversion rates he looked so cute when he concentrated she thought smiling she then looked at james who wasntreally listening but instead doodling on a piece of parchment as always the letters l e appeared but diya could see his own initials there too j p l e he had written over and over again diya grinned amused at how in love james was he couldnteven forget about lily if she were just on the other side of the classroom let alone in a different one at this thought diya sighed again deeply looking down ivana sketched the unicorn in front of her as its baby trotted by peter was sitting much to her delight a long way away near some sneering slytherins although they seemed to be doing nothing to peter now ivana had her wand at the ready in case he needed protection although she thoroughly disliked the boy she put up with him for the marauder sake and helped him out in this one lesson which only the two of them shared we re not here to win an art competition miss petrova do a simple diagram please professor tortoyla scolded in her pleasant voice ivana hastily crossed out her beautiful sketch and quickly did a diagram of the unicorn she then sat back rather bored wondering what the others were up to before cillian martin begged to copy her work sirius slumped in his chair extremely bored arithmancy primarily was made up of ravenclaws as it was such a difficult subject although there were three gryffindors two slytherins and only one hufflepuff also in the newt class when professor abelian entered the room to begin the lesson sirius noticed the seat next to lily empty for once he grabbed his stuff and threw himself in the chair next to her and grinned she tried to frown at him for the disruption but couldnthelp but grin back the girl on sirius other side was now looking rather flustered mr black any reason you decided to come out of the shadows of the back and grace us with your attention abelian asked looking over the rims of his spectacles oh i wanted to truly enjoy the experience of your lesson sir sirius remarked smiling the class allowed a giggle to escape at this whilst the teacher even looked amused he then turned to the blackboard and began writing out formulae the class scurried to copy it down lilzabar i bored sirius complained after about ten minutes of note taking sirius shush and dontcall me lilzabar lily whispered distractedly ok lilzabar you know it just a revision lesson even clearwater talking sirius reminded her gesturing to the most intelligent serious and quiet boy in their year who was whispering with his friend lily glanced up and sighed sirius she warned trying to get back to her notes ok lils give me one magical property of the number seven sirius challenged that easy the number seven was originally discovered to be magical when a seventh dwarf joined the original founding magical clan tipesk lily rattled off like a textbook before getting cut in snidely by sirius still need to revise ah shut your face lily said dropping her quill on to the desk and glaring at her friend so what do you suggest we talk about other than arithmancy oh i dunno you and james wedding what lily hissed in a surprised voice this reaction made sirius chuckle madly as she narrowed her eyes at him not funny sirius we ve barely been together two months we re not thinking that far ahead but you re in love and that yeah lily looked away rather dreamily for a moment and smiled at an amused sirius can i be in the wedding he asked cheekily oi stop it she whined trying to hide a smile can i be best man or wait i ll be a bridesmaid sirius joked making lily giggle a bridesmaid for sure i ll pick some daisies to put in your hair and everything she played along grinning what would be in your hair then mrs potter lavender and i d wanna carry roses and james would have a small rose pinned to his front lily answered smiling dazedly at the thought her face beaming i thought you werentthinking that far ahead sirius cocked an eyebrow and grinned sirius lily exclaimed loudly as she pushed him her face suddenly turning bright red sirius was close to falling off his chair from the violent push when the kind but strict professor rapped the desk miss evans what are you doing he demanded looking surprised then he stopped for a second and narrowed his eyes at a grinning sirius lily was red in the face and looked extremely sorry for the interruption on second thought mr black detention for provoking miss evans and causing unnecessary interruptions professor abelian said casting a stern look at sirius who grinned sheepishly totally worth it though he whispered to lily quickly who blushed even more profusely and clicked her tongue before working out some more problems sirius grinned at her embarrassment and then looked around the classroom at his hard working classmates sirius eyes then idly came to rest on the other gryffindor girl beside him who was blushing fiercely pretending not to notice him looking she was quite pretty and he thought he remembered her being in the girl dorm so he smiled at her pleasantly his eyes then however came to rest on her desk where they almost fell out of their sockets there was a box of blue stationery more specifically pretty pale blue note paper sirius silently took the valentine note from his pocket and unfolded it yes definitely the same paper his face curved into a huge grin as he looked at her while she casually tucked strand of her light brown hair behind her ear she was chewing nervously on her lip and suddenly sirius didntthink he d ever seen anything as cute before he nudged lily quickly and asked what the girl name was rolling her eyes lily answered that polly sirius she been around us for ages she in my dorm sirius grinned again and scribbled a quick note dear polly i couldntget your valentine note out of my head meet me after class yours sirius he then folded it into a square and tossed it on to her desk she opened her eyes rather wide and sirius noticed they were also a light brown feeling very pleased he didntthink he could remember eyes that sparkled more than that after reading the note she giggled and nodded at him enthusiastically what a beautiful laugh sirius thought dreamily ivana trudged back to the common room twenty minutes after lessons had ended for the day to meet with her friends before dinner she d had to help clean up the dragon dung as apparently it scared the unicorns so she was rather irritated and smelly as she approached the portrait hole she saw sirius appearing to be leaning forwards on to a wall she smiled and said hey sirius what are you her voice trailed off as he didntnotice her he had moved slightly and ivana could now see her dorm mate polly backed up against the wall giggling as sirius leaned over her flirting ivana stood her eyes glued to them for a moment and as sirius stroked polly cheek and leaned in ivana quickly muttered the password and went into the common room determined not to see anymore tears were beginning to form in her normally twinkling blue eyes but she tightly held them in as she saw her friends sniffing quickly she laughed a little fakely and spoke to them so how come sirius is macking on polly all of a sudden she asked pretending to be amused james remus and peter went off into fits of laughter and diya and lily shook their heads also amused when the boys didntstop laughing and diya also went into fresh peals ivana jaw tightened haha how come though she repeated but tried to laugh lily noticed this slight irritation so quickly filled her in oh something about this really special valentines day note he got from her ivana face fell but she quickly recovered as she plopped down in an armchair and laughed ohhh one of the many eh what did it say she jokily asked james who had finally calmed down a little ohh ahaha it was this one liner but he went into fits of laughter again nudging remus so ivana decided not to push it she didntwant to seem too interested so she shrugged oh inside her heart dropped though and her mind was thinking a million thoughts glancing at sirius as he came in holding an ecstatic polly hand ivana vaguely heard diya ask carefully iv why do you smell like dragon dung ivana held her head in her hands as she thought to herself could this day possibly get any worse when sirius sat down with them withpolly on his lap she knew the answer to that question was yes a n i would tell you to review but i hope instead you picked up on my not so subtle hint hahaha pam xx authors note sorry it took me so long with the update guys school has been aghh anyway here it is thanks to my faithful lovelyyy reviewers padfootobsessed329 queen of duct tape ange marauder obsessive animerocksjapanrocks and nick i posted a new summary i hope ppl can still find the story oh so the big question we re all asking is did polly write the note or did ivana hmmm uncertainties and falling out ivana irritably waved her wand to erase the mistakes in her last minute transfiguration homework at breakfast one morning it wasntthe homework assignment however which was annoying her she shook her head and shot a disgusted look at the cooing couple in front of her ordinarily she could ve dealt with the public displays of affection if it had been lily and james or even diya and remus but this time the pair of sirius and polly sat laughing annoyingly in front of her they had been together almost two weeks now and sirius hadntshown one sign of boredom yet ivana angrily exhaled as polly let out a high pitched giggle which hit her last nerve trying very hard not to throw sirius an incredulous look as he seemed to find every aspect of polly interesting ivana got up muttering to herself she plonked herself further up the table in between two members of the wizard chess club and scribbled down the rest of her assignment sirius was a little disgruntled at the looks ivana was throwing polly why was it that she could laugh about and be nice to all his other girlfriends and not to polly it barely made sense considering those relationships barely lasted a week whereas he felt there was a more deep aspect to his new girlfriend true she hadntreally shown much of the personality he had been expecting from the writer of that note but he figured she was still getting used to the situation he was determined to give her a chance because he couldntremember a time he d been more flattered and taken by a compliment as polly giggled at his latest joke he smiled until he noticed ivana get up in a huff and move elsewhere his smile faltered as he watched his friend scribble out a conclusion sitting considerably further away but dismissed the confusion when polly leaned in for a kiss he could ask ivana what her problem was later on lily was pressed against the wall locked in a passionate embrace with james when he pulled back he had a small but elated smile on his face lily started to blush a little at the way james was looking at her james stop she said leaning back laughing james stopped her moving away from him by holding tightly on to her waist and staring at her fully into her eyes you re so beautiful evans he whispered twirling a loose strand of her hair around his finger lily blushed again but smiled dontsay things like that potter she countered playfully james chuckled and stroked the side of her face before leaning in again to gently kiss her before tickling her ear with his warm breath saying silkily i love you lily smiled contentedly and opened her mouth to repeat his words to him when another voice spoke i love you too potter came an equally silky but sarcasm dripping voice severus snape stood mocking them wearing a disgusting expression shut up snivellus james said turning around james no leave it lily tugged on his sleeve urgently so james lowered his ready fists but continued to glare at severus yes there a good boy no mind of his own does everything his precious little girlfriend says james had now brandished his wand fiercely looking as if he were about to throw a punch he looked ready to lunge at snape but lily forcefully held him back no james he just trying to provoke you she insisted towing him into the transfiguration classroom behind her although james allowed himself to be towed reluctantly which lily took as a sign of acceptance he sneakily aimed the jelly legs curse at snape who was snickering at him sirius arrived just in time to witness this holding protectively on to polly hand as he practically dragged the rather slow paced girl to class their energy levels obviously deferred nice one prongs he congratulated as he parted ways with polly and sat with james remus and peter at the back james grinned back at him sheepishly but looked quite proud of himself just donttell lily he laughed casting a quick glance at his girlfriend who sat in between diya and polly at the front of the class ivana had been moved by professor mcgonagall in order to exert a positive influence on lestat krakov a slytherin who was also from russia she neednthave bothered however as krakov seemed mild in comparison to most slytherins in fact the boys had often wondered what part of his personality made him a slytherin sirius noted that ivana seemed to be getting along well with lestat laughing pleasantly at something he was showing her a slight heat seemed to run through sirius body momentarily as he watched them flirt but he instantly dismissed this as the feeling of an overprotective friend when he saw polly reach for his favourite blue notepaper and scribble something on it to show her friend jenna they both turned to look at him giggling and sirius waved at them a little wearily he then felt a rush of guilt at this weariness and flashed his girlfriend a huge smile he was glad there was the excuse of the valentine note to keep him committed for once professor mcgonagall paced at the front of the class announcing the day lesson choose a partner quickly and proceed to take turns at conjuring up chairs i realise we did this last lesson but now i wish for you to perform a non verbal spell right questions go sirius made a beeline for polly so jenna paired up with diya who was looking a little huffily at remus sorry love it just pete really needs a hand you understand he said to her quickly before settling next to peter and practising the spell diya face held a little pout as she watched for a while but then turned to jenna with a genuine smile and both girls tried the spell sirius wrapped his arms around polly and held her wand correcting her flick whispering sweet nothings in her ear ivana watched for a second and then loudly turned her attention to her pre assigned partner krakov he was very good looking and he reminded her of russia so she flirted with him a little openly showing her pleasure with mcgonagall choice for her partner lily and james of course were bickering over whom flick was right james was of course but after two or three minutes of watching lily indignant face he decided to tell her she was right this made her grin triumphantly before proceeding to fail at the spell james then smirked at her whilst he easily produced a chair non verbally oh sirius you do seem to like touching me polly said happily as sirius slinked his arm around her waist again this rather awkward comment drew a laugh from ivana who promptly returned to talking to krakov and a confused expression on sirius polly always seemed to have a knack for saying what everyone was thinking he recovered quickly enough however saying to her huskily oh cos you know no one makes my heart beat as fast oh that sweet dear thanks polly said smiling at him and sitting down again sirius was a little confused wasntrepeating her note in context romantic she d barely noticed frowning a little he looked at her curiously so what re you doing love oh i admiring your handwriting it so unique all scrawly and rushed like a spider it a little like your friend james but i think his is more round which i dontreally like remus on the other hand has beautiful handwriting it so very neat and careful and i do like it yes i really do that other boy though peter his handwriting is awful barely readable sirius looked incredulous at this monologue and raised an eyebrow exactly how long could one go on about handwriting for um sure love that great he said dismissing his bad thoughts and kissing her cheek this was the girl of his dreams she had to be if the girl who wrote the note didntturn out to be the one then there was no one out of the corner of his eye however he noticed ivana loudly saying to krakov oh wow you re from moscow too i remembered they made the guys good there she winked her laugh tinkling once again sirius temper seemed to rise damn krakov why couldnthe just stop flirting with her he tried desperately to ignore the fact that ivana seemed to be responding enthusiastically why was he concentrating on ivana anyway when the beautiful polly stood next to him and apparently albus dumbledore has extremely disfigured handwriting too she was rambling he sighed inwardly and tried to focus on brown eyes rather than his irritation with his blue eyed friend behind him he felt the puzzling anger creep into the pit of his stomach as ivana smiled at lestat the feeling was rather foreign to him it probably just cos he a slytherin he thought desperately then snapping focus hurriedly back to polly he slid his arms around her waist and hugged her from behind earning a giggle he smiled at her until he felt a tap on his shoulder mr black please keep your public displays of affection out of my classroom ten points from gryffindor professor mcgonagall said icily sirius released his hold on polly and was about to make his usual friendly comment to his teacher when he heard ivana cough to cover up a laugh irritated at this he merely accepted the punishment and glared at ivana who pretended to look back at him innocently class ended a few moments later and on the way back to his bag sirius grabbed ivana arm we need to talk he muttered angrily before storming off ivana slowly picked up her bag and inwardly kicked herself for being so obvious about her irritation with sirius new girlfriend as the gryffindors headed to their next lesson sirius put his arm around polly and marched forward not seeing polly smack straight into an infuriated ivana with a smirk ohh i hate that girl ivana grumbled to her friends as they walked diya and lily exchanged a glance ivana sirius is happy look i know polly not exactly you know interesting but he likes her shouldntyou be happy for him interesting bah she as boring as professor binns ivana exclaimed referring to the extremely boring ghost who taught the history of magic you know you should ve just told him you liked him ivana lily put in gently i do not like him i just dontlike seeing him with idiotic girls and bah he thinks this girl is the real thing that boy is absolutely out of his mind crazy who sirius james asked overhearing he draped an arm over lily shoulders kissing her swiftly on the cheek although lily rolled her eyes at this gesture he knew she was trying hard not to blush remus walked beside diya and exasperated at the lack of acknowledgment diya grabbed his hand and gave him a look he grinned apologetically at her which instantly made her smile ivana exhaled loudly being surrounded by two lovey dovey couples was not was she needed right now she even half wished peter had been there but he d gone off to the hospital wing apparently feeling ill no one really noticed snape nott and regulus black were also missing from their next classes yes sirius and polly euch ivana answered making james laugh yeah she a card eh i think i heard her go on about handwriting for at least fifteen minutes the other day he commented looking rather put off she the head of the hand writing and gobstones club remus explained simply wow that exhilarating ivana said sarcastically making james chuckle again how do you know rem lily inquired hiding her own amusement he joined gobstones diya laughed cheekily shut up you i most certainly did not i just work in the same part of the library as the hand writing club have their meetings sure diya joked provoking remus to run after her as she tried to escape giggling infectiously lily however sighed i better go tell them flabberghast is around the corner i suppose she said tiredly walking ahead to catch up with the noisy pair ivana sighed again her mind still elsewhere james noticed and felt pretty awful he d always thought ivana was such a nice hilarious girl not to mention her and sirius were far past the just friends category infact james thought he d much prefer sirius arm to be around her shoulders instead of the rather blank polly i dontmuch like her either ivana but sirius is convinced on trying this that note really got him he said trying to bring the russian girl out of her thoughts this seemed to spark new depression and she sighed deeply oh that infamous note what was so great about it anyway she asked not remembering to hide the jealousy in her voice umm it was very short went something like no one makes my heart beat faster or something i cantreally remember james supplied cautiously ivana had stopped in her tracks her mouth was open slightly and she looked extremely confused not to mention surprised when she saw james looking at her puzzled she snapped back to focus and asked was sirius sure it was from polly trying to sound nonchalant um well he was pretty convinced he noticed she had the exact same blue notepaper as the note that sorta how he found out james answered vaguely it suddenly hit him that this wasntexactly a reliable method ivana looked crest fallen for a moment but said oh sure oh yes he probably right then looking rather lost she waved at james and headed into the classroom james waited before following her he was thinking very hard about the recent developments charms was the only lesson where the marauders were split up seating wise lily and james sat to their delight next to each other at one side of the classroom earlier in the year however it had been more to lily dismay wood sat with his fianc e cassie behind them remus was located right at the back corner with peter usually although absent today a few seats to his left they were often separated by ravenclaws and today marilee sat beside remus diya was right at the opposite end of the classroom with her eyes narrowed at her boyfriends ex ivana sat bang in the centre of the classroom beside a scrawny ravenclaw boy with her arms folded across her chest james noticed she was in deep thought he himself wasntthoughtless after his conversation with ivana he had his suspicions but for now he decided to ignore this and pretend that he was better than lily at charms sirius strolled in a few minutes late having dropped polly at the nearby staircase to divination then seeing ivana he raised an eyebrow and plopped next to the ravenclaw boy sirius glared at her his arms also folded but she had turned her back slightly plainly ignoring him the boy in between them looked a little puzzled at their silence being used to getting distracted by the talkative friends he looked nervously from sirius to ivana and quickly bent his head over a book waiting for flitwick to arrive he was rather late well petrova arentyou going to explain sirius demanded a little too loudly gaining some people attention explain what black ivana replied coolly still refusing to look at him instead she pretended to be very interested in the back of emmeline vance head you know exactly what ivana why the hostility sirius hissed angrily there no hostility she shot back too quickly sirius sighed and looked a little upset ivvy he pleaded gently with a much quieter voice at this ivana was convinced her heart had torn into two she slowly turned to look at him not daring to speak for fear of bursting into tears ivvy you cantnot like her i mean i really like her iv cantyou just sirius started a little weakly i sorry sirius you re right i haventexactly tried i ll give her a chance ivana couldntlook directly into his eyes because she knew she was lying sirius knew too but not knowing what else to do he nodded and thanked her the awkwardness remained for a few seconds as the class watched the two intently sirius then clicked his tongue angrily is there any reason why you lot cantmind your own bloody business he exclaimed looking stonily around the room luckily for them flitwick hurried in the next moment and began the lesson it passed rather uneventfully other than the small guy separating sirius and ivana having a huge uncharacteristic outburst saying i canttake the tension any more please professor can i move sirius had tried to exchange a sheepish grin with ivana but she didntnotice he wasntsure why he felt so terrible because of the lack of attention he watched her tuck her beautiful blonde hair behind her ear over and over again until she finally impatiently pulled it into a messy ponytail off her shoulders he then almost chuckled at the process begin over again with her long flicky fringe finally she pulled it off her eyes and clipped it back fully revealing her crystally blue eyes she sent a small smile at sirius and returned to her work leaving him rather uncomfortable because for some reason yet unknown to him he couldntseem to forget the way her eyes twinkled even with just a hint of a smile padfoot i have a bone to pick james announced storming into the common room a few lessons later sirius sat wrapped closely around polly and they didntstop what they were doing even when james addressed his friend clearing his throat roughly james rapped his knuckles on sirius head causing him to detach from the girl and glare at his friend whilst rubbing his head james what the hell he asked angrily as james grabbed his arm tightly and pulled him out of the portrait hole he hastily pulled out the marauder map and scanned the dots james saw remus lupin waiting for them outside by the lake lily evans in her room for a moment he contemplated rushing up to her and giving up on his clueless best friend diya and ivana were located in the common room obviously a little away from polly and jenna probably gossiping james thought annoyed at sirius decision in girlfriend he didntsee peter pettigrew anywhere but he dismissed the thought thinking peter had probably just got lost on the way back to the common room noting where filch and the teachers were roaming the corridors james pulled a disgruntled sirius through a passageway to meet remus ok so what this about then sirius asked lazily stretching as he leaned back against the beech tree ivana remus had a knowing look on his face oh we sorted it out guys we re ok she gonna try with polly dude you and ivana were so close to actually admitting you had feelings for each other and then you just randomly start going out with polly who by the way you didnteven notice until recently so look it was the note alright it was special to me dontask me why i donteven know it just was so leave it please sirius demanded frustratedly well what if the note wasntfrom polly james asked slyly as he joined his friends sitting on the grass at this sirius rolled his eyes man just cos you want me to go out with iv doesntmean you can pretend the note was from her no man i mean have you and polly ever fully discussed the note before remus asked eagerly sirius thought for a moment in fact they hadn t but but no this is crazy polly sent the note sirius listen i talked to ivana today james started going on to tell sirius about the thought provoking conversation he d had with the russian girl earlier that day so she sounded confused i mean that doesntmean anything sirius denied standing up irritated in truth it did sound suspicious could it be was it one of his best friends who d sent the note a blonde girl who knew him almost as well as the marauders or was it polly suddenly he couldnthelp wishing it was ivana he d tried to push the nagging feelings he d been having for her aside but what if sirius remus was asking repeatedly oh what oh guys look ivana is a great girl i adore her but we re just friends i wouldntwant to wreck a friendship like that for a stupid little romance anyway even if she did send the note sirius argued waking up from his thoughts he couldnthave feelings for ivana with his past experiences in relationships he d probably ruin their friendship and he was sure that he didntwant to do that it wasntworth it right although remus nodded sadly at this james had a grin on his face you like her man and she wrote the note its perfect shut up prongs polly wrote the note i like her she so boring padfoot shut up look i know the girl who sent me that valentine is somewhere inside polly it ll come out eventually sirius said desperately getting rather annoyed with james sirius ivana is perfect for you she is you know padfoot remus added of course she is you d fall in love with her james shouted at his friend sirius glared at him and yelled back just cos you got yourself into that mess doesntmean i going to ok leave me the hell alone you two i gonna find polly with this sirius stormed off having possibly his first real fight with his two best friends what mess remus asked james who was staring fixedly after sirius love james answered quietly gaining an understanding look from remus before the two boys heading towards the castle a n yo if you read this

punching his pillow very hard except in his mind it wasnthis pillow flashback to 20 minutes earlier sirius was sitting absent mindedly listening to polly talk about one of her clubs oh of course handwriting heroes is a little less popular than gobstones but i honestly think you should join siri i mean you do have such beautiful writing she was saying her voice droning into sirius aching head trying with all his might to not make a sarcastic comment he simply answered his girlfriend with an even voice maybe love her monotonous voice seemed to faze out of sirius concentration and a husky but animated voice took its place ivana was talking to lily and diya about the history of magic homework and although the topic was absolutely dreadfully boring he couldnthelp but hang on to every word she said when she laughed the clear amusement shone through and it was a smooth and tinkling sound polly beautiful laugh on the other hand had suddenly become to sirius perhaps the most annoying sound known to mankind it was high pitched and too giggly not to mention sirius could practically see the affectedness through every sound reluctantly he had agreed with james on this fact still however he couldntseem to break it off with her sure he had fun with her when well when they werenttalking but she just wasnthis type in all honesty she bored him half to death this was one thing he would not admit to remus and james because then they would bring up the topic of ivana and sirius was not going to talk about that although the three had made up the day after their big fight sirius still sent james a warning look every time he tried to bring up ivana it was the last week of march so the sky was blue and the sun was shining however unlike most other couples sirius and polly remained in the common room for fear that polly skin might burn sirius watched longingly as james and lily head outside hand in hand remus was having a career discussion with professor mcgonagall so diya was sulking ivana seemed to be looking outside longingly too but she reluctantly bent her head to do some work just as sirius decided it was ridiculous to be staring at her for this long marcus forsynthe approached ivana alright ivana he asked timidly ivana looked up with a raised eyebrow she hadnttalked to marcus since the ball but she was still rather wary of him yeah forsynthe you she replied lacking the friendly vibe the boy had put out sirius looked down to hide a huge smile but this quickly disappeared when marcus spoke again i ok so where ve you been lately i hardly see you anymore he exclaimed ignoring her stiffness ivana looked as incredulous as sirius for a moment and spoke uh she paused a moment and saw sirius with the giant grin on his face as he knew exactly how rude she had planned to be to the overly flirtatious guy this however irritated her slightly so for some reason she decided to be nice instead i dunno i ve sorta been busy i suppose yeah i miss hanging out marcus looked delighted and proceeded to say rather cornily have you been doing something different with yourself cos you re looking more and more beautiful everyday sirius was shocked when ivana didntflatly tell forsynthe to push off but now he was convinced she d put him in his place after that ridiculous line polly kissed him on the cheek at that moment so he automatically distractedly kissed the top of her head as he watched ivana seeing sirius and polly kiss even if it wasnttheir usual making out angered ivana even more than the line marcus had just thrown at her so she decided to yet again change her reaction she giggled inwardly she felt sick but she smiled brightly at the beaming forsynthe and smacked him lightly on the arm before saying coyly oh marcus you always knew compliments will get you a smile she continued to smile and giggle at what the overjoyed boy was saying but out of the corner of her eye observed a fuming sirius after a few moments he excused himself from polly and stormed off to the boy dormitories end of flashback sirius stopped punching the pillow for a second breathing slightly harder than normal he almost laughed he was acting like a twelve year old girl he paused a moment and looked at the pillow then with all his might he chucked the pillow across the room at the door with a large shout just as the pillow flung towards the door james strolled in and with quick reflexes caught the pillow easily after throwing it casually to the side he cocked an eyebrow at sirius alright mate he smirked ahhhhhhhhhhh sirius yelled flinging peter jar of bertie botts every flavour beans at james the amused boy again caught the jar easily and popped the top open choosing a brown bean and throwing it in the air to catch it in his mouth sirius watched blinking menacingly hoping it was vomit flavoured until james smiled chocolate bugger sirius swore angrily and flopped back on the bed half heartedly throwing his untouched transfiguration book at james who caught it deftly in one hand padfoot mate if you wanted to give me chaser practice we could ve just gone to the pitch and practiced with the quaffle he said in a satisfied voice before plonking himself on to his bed facing sirius who had his arms crossed over his chest and an annoyed expression on his face you know what lily would ve said if she saw you like that sirius that she was actually madly in love with me and was using you to get to me sirius replied boredly looking at the wall giving him a look james continued to say no you wish she would ve said you ll get wrinkles if you donttell someone why your face looks like that well i dunno how it happened really my dad and mum joined evil forces unfortunately both were devastatingly good looking bred me and along with this devilish charm and intense expressions i just became irresistible did anyone tell you you ve become conceited someone needed to compensate for you sirius what is wrong james insisted with a voice that made sirius look at him just messed up is all he answered not giving much away if anyone else was to have overheard but it was very clear to james look if you dontlike polly then just dump her it not that simple james sirius answered sighing deeply and running a hand through the thick mess of dark hair and go out with ivana and that is most certainly not simple james sirius tried to put on a serious face but he was too depressed to ignore the obvious feelings he was having for ivana it ok to like her you know maybe you guys could have something better than a friendship james reasoned defiantly jumping at the chance to make his point whilst sirius wasntmad no i mean just cos i attracted to her doesntmean we wontbreak up and kill what we already have sirius stood up and started pacing back and forth james said nothing and just stared at sirius with a knowing look on his face ahhh shut up prongs sirius burst angrily storming out he realised too late that the only thing he would be coming back to in the common room was either ivana and marcus or polly and her handwriting seeing that marcus was no longer there he sighed in relief and headed towards ivana however she was heading out of the portrait hole she smiled cheerfully at lestat krakov who was talking to professor mcgonagall about the transfiguration assignment outside the portrait hole and turned down a corridor just as the hole shut sirius gazed at the spot for a moment and then plopped down next to polly we need to talk polly although at that moment he definitely wasntgoing to pursue his feelings for ivana he knew he simply couldntbe with polly any longer listen polly i loved your valentine note and all but ah yes your eyes like cauldrons your lips like roses your hair like coal your laugh like gold polly began to recite sirius was confused he opened his eyes wide uh what my note the one you loved polly answered sirius gulped he then removed a tattered blue note from his pocket and unfolded it smoothening the paper out slowly uh you didntwrite this he asked slowly what no this is my blue paper i use the pink scented paper for special occasions you mean my note wasntthe one you loved she took the note and examined it closely before looking at him questioningly no polly i sorry i i sirius was stuttering but didntknow what to say but it is your paper he asked puzzled well yes but not the special one i have loads of this everyone in my dorm just helps themselves to it every time they need to write a note for the bathroom or to remind themselves so i suppose we re over then there it was again polly uncanny knack to say the most awkward thing possible um well it been fun but sorry sirius tried sheepishly genuinely not wanted to hurt the girl feelings but polly waved him off it ok to be honest we dontexactly have the same interests she looked a little sad and continued to stare at the paper sirius got up rather awkwardly and looked apologetic um can i um have the note back oh yes here polly said handing him it breaking her dazed state he took it apologetically and turned to stride out of the common room ivana petrova polly said from behind him he turned around confusedly um what that her handwriting sirius had a little skip to his walk as he rushed off in search of ivana it was strange it had been somewhat of a complete surprise finding out the note was definitely from her but it had just felt so right it was at that moment that he d realised he d wished it was ivana all along she was the one he actually wanted to be with she was special to him all his doubts about their friendship being ruined seemed to have been momentarily wiped from his conscience all he could think about was she sent the note he was now practically kicking himself at the thought of all those lost opportunities all the unnoticed moments which had passed them by the entire year the time she d laughed with him as they teased diya and remus acting uncharacteristically shy with each other the way she d cheekily pulled him along with her when the marauders had thrown her into the lake on her birthday the general easiness of her relationship with him and his friends quite unlike diya and lily she d never caused any great dispute the way she d argued with him unrelentingly when their opinions hadntmatched so unlike the other girls he knew not to mention her voice of reason during the whole fall out with lily how had he missed the significance of all these moments how had he missed the way her blue eyes shimmered and her blonde hair danced when she was amused had he really not accepted that her random sense of humour and unusual way of thinking complemented his own in a way no one else did ivana was perfect to him and he had to tell her lost in his thoughts sirius had taken a turn away from the passageway to the lake oh no matter he d seen her avoid that route earlier anyway so the chances of her being there already were slim perhaps she was in one of the classrooms or the owlery sending a letter to her parents back in russia he turned back to go up to the owlery when he thought he heard a muffled scream who was screaming pausing he listened again carefully and jumped at the louder shriller scream of no disrupted the silence of the corridor he took off running down the corridor pausing to check in classrooms as the yells became muffled again and was interrupted by an evil sounding laugh not noticing the painting of barnaby the barmy with the trolls hanging near him he thought desperately where are they god where are they i need to find them before something bad happens just then a door appeared in the wall shocking him glancing quickly at the painting he put two and two together and rushed into the room of requirement james had found the room once before when they were setting up a prank and needed to hide but they d never seen it since sirius didntstop to ponder if the room could actually be found on purpose inside lestat krakov stood struggling someone on to a large green and silver sofa sirius hoping urgently he hadntsimply walked in on krakov and his girlfriend thought it best he double check the russian slytherin wasntcausing any trouble even if he did seem like an alright bloke oi krakov what re you doing he stopped abruptly as the burly seventh year turned grimacing at him and trying in vain to conceal the girl beneath him sirius finally registered why the seemingly bearable krakov had been chosen to be in slytherin the girl had shining pale blonde hair and deep set blue eyes however they werentshimmering instead they were riddled with fear and tears were streaming from them opening her mouth to call out to sirius ivana voice was lost krakov had put the silencing charm on her sirius was shaking with anger he hurled himself at krakov pulled him off ivana and began pummelling him kicking and punching him with all the strength he could muster he yelled all the obscenities he could think of i swear if you come near her again i ll kill you he finished breathing heavily with fire in his eyes turning away from the bloody mess lying in front of him he quickly muttered finite incantem and took ivana in his arms sobbing she buried her face into his chest and clung to him his eyes took in her madly dishevelled hair and tear stained face and said softly assuring her it ll be alright ivana i promise i here i here he stroked her hair softly and her ragged breathing slowly began to calm sirius she whispered looking up into his eyes her own filled with fresh tears it was my fault i was fl flirting with him she stammered looking away ashamed sirius shook his head iv no matter what he had no right to force you into anything we ll let dumbledore deal with him it not your fault he stressed holding on to her shoulders tightly a flicker of a smile crept onto her face you dontthink i was just being a tease sirius grinned and said jokingly ah iv everyone knows you re a tease this git however took his pursuit too far ivana laughed and shoved him gently no iv just because you wontagree to go out with every guy who flirts with you doesntmake you a tease seriously donteven worry about it ivana nodded but questioned him seriously i ve never seen you so mad before why um well why sirius took a deep breath well firstly you re one of my closest friends secondly no girl should be treated like that least of all you and well because he paused nervously no one else makes my heart beat as fast ivana looked at him with wide eyes he knew her mouth hung open slightly as she struggled to find words sirius i but before she could finish sirius had closed his eyes and leaned forward melting her gently into a sweet and innocent kiss i wont update unless i get atleast 5

and sirius stood kissing in a dark discreet corner they seemed oblivious to their surroundings until they heard voices coming from a nearby corridor immediately they separated and ivana straightened her hair sirius put a finger to his lips and listened closely to what james remus and peter were talking about i cantbelieve they re having a kid james was saying in disbelief i know i mean getting married was crazy enough but now she pregnant too remus replied where will they live peter wondered as usual his comment went unnoticed because just at that moment sirius jumped out from the corner what i miss he said cheerfully ignoring the surprised looks on his friends faces cassie pregnant her and dave are going to have a baby remus explained oh yeah i know she told me the other week at practice she due in october sirius said looking nervously over his shoulder she quit quidditch how are we gonna win the cup james complained s alrite prongsie you ll think of something sirius wrapped an arm around his friends shoulders and pretended to kick peter he then steered them all back in the opposite direction casually throwing a glance over his shoulder at ivana who was peeking around the corner waiting for them to leave when they were out of view ivana leaned back against the wall with a giant grin on her face she and sirius had been together a few wonderful days now krakov was sent back to durmstrang and she couldntbe happier except that her friends didntknow yet sirius and ivana had decided to save some of their pride not to tell the others yet both had made such strong cases against having feelings for each other they felt like they d rather avoid the i told you so s and keep their relationship a secret for a while as ivana joined the others in transfiguration she noticed james retreating sadly from an apologetic cassie he sat slumped in his seat at the back with a faraway look in his eyes ivana looked at sirius questioningly before sitting beside lily and diya why didntshe tell me earlier padfoot james exclaimed running his hands roughly through his hair the healer only told her yesterday she wouldntbe able to fly james sirius answered pointedly but the final is in two days how will i find a replacement it ok prongs you ll figure it out remus said reassuringly it doesntmatter even if you do lose though james does it peter put in squeakily remus stared at him incredulously before looking worriedly at james sirius was staring at peter as if he was mad and james was scarily silent at the front of the class professor mcgonagall was beginning the lesson it doesntmatter wormtail are you off your bloody rocker james hissed in disbelief while peter cowered away pete number one it the cup final number two it against slytherin three it my last year at hogwarts and i the captain four when have i ever not cared about even one match and five it quidditch we cantlose he shouted the last point mr potter please discuss quidditch outside my classroom the class tittered at james obsession and he said sorry professor in a small voice he then threw peter a pained glance and looked a little green as he gulped and began to take notes cassie looked very troubled as david patted her assuringly lily threw her a sympathetic glance and sent james a glowering look she then scribbled a note and when mcgonagall turned around she pointed her wand at it and it disappeared a second late it appeared in front of james james i know you re upset but give it a rest cassie feels bad enough lily james read it annoyed and threw a warning look at his friends who seemed to agree with lily he then crumpled up the note and muttered women dontrealise what a serious business quidditch is although he hadntintended to make cassie feel bad he couldnthelp being irritated with lily why was she being such a know it all james was quiet the whole lesson he barely smiled even when sirius turned snape hair purple he didnteven laugh when sirius was given a two hour detention washing and grooming mrs norris the caretaker cat as the class walked out lily lined her arm with james sensing he was a little irritated with her he glanced down distractedly before falling back into his daze the seven 18 year olds walked in silence for a few moment when suddenly james let out a yell i ve got it he looked extremely excited i ll play chaser and keeper lily rolled her eyes and sirius sent her a mischievous grin before saying sarcastically cos that ll work spiffingly mate it will better than some kid who barely played it ll be the best match in millions of years it ll surpass all my records to the pitch padfoot round up the team with that he rushed off yelling at any of his teammates in sight arrogant arrogant arrogant lily said listlessly not following him but taking the turn to ancient runes and you date this maniac lils sirius replied in mock wonder before dragging his feet on his way to the pitch they others slowly dispersed and when they were out of sight ivana rushed after sirius she hugged him from behind and he turned smiling longingly i guess this means we canttell them until the match is over eh ivana asked after he kissed her after the final at the celebration party it ll be great i ll see you later ok sirius answered pecking her cheek swiftly and heading outside two days later the gryffindor team sat pecking nervously at their breakfast james was pale faced and staring into space he was beginning to wonder whether he d taken on too much the other players were looking almost as worried despite trusting their captain they too were anxious james would end up being too tired to pull it off sirius the only team member shoveling food quickly in his mouth stopped for a second and looked at them all swallowing his mouthful he said exasperatedly oh my godd relax guys eat you ll fall off your brooms if you haventeaten slowly the others began to eat james however still looked ghostly pale as he fidgeted with the eggs on his plate sirius saw this and whispered to him listen prongs if there any player who can pull this off it you ok and with all the racing up and down the pitch you need to eat ok mate james nodded and ate a little the team got dressed in silence they walked to the pitch in silence they stood in silence in front of a silent captain he finally took a deep breath and spoke ok team we are the best team gryffindor has ever had we have a seeker who couldnthave come out of a slump quicker and more brilliantly we have two unbelievable beaters one crafty clever and head boy the other well sirius at this everyone laughed including sirius loudly three brilliant chasers yes me included guys again the team let go of more of their nervousness by laughing and well i going to play keeper as well so look just play as well as you always do if we lose i ll never forgive myself and well neither should you james trailed off looking scared again no james we re a team you re the best player we know you ll pull it through wood said defiantly james looked at his appreciatively as the others nodded in agreement you re the best james cindy foster chaser number one said we love you james kira matthews chaser number two agreed we ll pull it through dontworry arron kingston the seeker assured him alright enough loving let do some hating chaps slytherin suck on three sirius announced putting his hand in the middle of the huddle the other placed their hands on top of his in a pile grinning sirius looked at james to indicate he lead the cheer 1 2 3 slytherin suck the team bellowed drawing cheers from the crowd the slytherins looked angry and quickly countered with gryffindor suck more oh that original sirius laughed mounting his broom captains shake clean game please madam hooch said rising into the air beside james and flint the slytherin captain they shook painfully practically breaking each other fingers and madam hooch blew her whistle james grabbed the quaffle immediately and passed to cindy with that he hurried to the goal posts willing his broomstick to go faster cassie was commentating and james potter passes the quaffle off he rushes to the goals potter is playing both chaser and keeper for today final the first player to do this in almost a century sorry by the way james james sent her a quick grin and focused his eyes on the game and foster passes to fellow chaser kira matthews oh gryffindor could use potter up the field about now oh what this there he is matthews passes to potter and potter scores gryffindor 10 slytherin nil no time for celebrating though because james has sped back to the goals wow is he going to be tired or what james did a little loop de loop on the way back to the posts as clorken of slytherin took possession and clorken passes to dimolen who speeds off ugh look at that face and his flying is so damn sluggish an insult to the sacred game of quidditch that is cassie said angrily she was probably about as serious about quidditch as even james was so it was quite upsetting not only to her but also the team that she couldntplay in the final miss murtleback fair commentating if you please mcgonagall yelled from behind her oh sorry professor i try but i was on the team after all it difficult oh and look dimolen who i sure can fly wonderfully well when he by himself that alright professor still has the quaffle he hesitating stupid git oops sorry um indecisive boy wont throw to his team members keep this up slytherin and we ll definetly flatten you oh he finally passed to mcnair damn shouldnthave given him advice sorry potter ok mcnair is heading towards the posts oh no james isntprotecting the third post potter ahh thank god a well placed bludger by sirius black nice one mate sirius grinned and smacked a relieved james a high five thanks padfoot james said his face a little pale s alrite prongs team effort sirius yelled before rushing after another bludger heading for foster and the quaffle is still in mcnair posession unfortunately even i can respect a good recovery oh dear no ahh once again the gryffindor chaser slash keeper for today has left one of his goals unprotected and this time no best mate to save him and dimolen scores after a deft pass from mcnair potter protect all the posts cassie yelled loudly at james who had been distracted from his keeper duties because he had been playing chaser and trying to steal possession i trying arenti i cantforget to be a chaser as well can i james huffed angrily 10 all gryffindor back in possession but if only kingston could find the snitch save james the trouble oh no sorry james ah oh well cassie sat back dejectedly and frustrated because she felt responsible for james predicament with the quaffle safely up the other side james rushed to the goal post nearest the commentating stand cass it not your fault ok listen just commentate cheer us on yeh i ll get the hang of this i promise he then hurried ahead to catch the quaffle from kira leaving cassie with a smile on her face alright then there goes the best chaser of the last twenty years james potter and he scores easy now if only he could get the hang of this two position thing oh well played wood atta boy david love that my fianc everyone perfectly aimed bludger right at dimolen oh dear babe duck ah and a brilliant escape by the sexy and handsome miss murtleback oh it mrs wood in two weeks professor cassie replied happily infuriating mcgonagall even more alright oh no potter caught off the mark again 20 20 the match went on like this james getting caught off guard repeatedly he was gradually getting more and more frustrated and visibly depressed the gryffindor supporters atmosphere had obviously quieted remus peter and the girls looked on worriedly as james punched the goalpost sirius looked at him angrily and then yelled time out he not the captain flint argued i the vice captain sirius countered no such thing oh yeah yeah sirius and flint were now glaring at each other circling in the air their heads were so close they were practically eyeball to eyeball and they fumed ready to murder each other at this point madam hooch blew her whistle enough nowhere in the rules does it say only the captain can call a timeout mr flint gryffindor time out flint gathered his team sulkily but his face quickly regained a horrible smirk as he talked lazily to the other slytherins 80 30 to slytherin and the gryffindor beater sirius black has called a time out cassie was saying sadly she would ve gladly whispered the score but the megaphone picked up on it and magically increased the volume sirius rounded up the team who were sweaty and panting james looked the most uninspired which ordinarily would ve been quite unusual look team we arentthat far behind we need to be 20 points ahead for kingston to catch the snitch or else we wontwin the overall tally and the cup so 70 points foster matthews you girls need to realise you re great james has scored all three goals and he playing two positions you need to believe you can do some scoring kingston keep at what you re doing avoid the snitch long enough and dontlet avery spot it me and wood are doing well dontgive me looks you guys it true james get yourself together man start saving some goals i know you re not a born keeper but you re usually good enough you re acting like wormtail out there sirius barked the team agreed with his directions but didntknow what james reaction would be i know i just i not sure i can james said dejectedly of course you can dontbe an idiot be a prat go back to being the conceited arse you used to be just for today you have to for gryffindor the team nodded and echoed his sentiments for gryffindor james a fire seemed to light inside james at these words you re right i can do this i james potter james potter we re gonna win this one guys because it for gryffindor there the bastard we know and love sirius smiled as the others laughed shut it padfoot i the captain here come on team let show this school just how bloody brilliant we really are for gryffindor james grinned and set off determinedly the others exchanged beaming smiles with sirius and followed suit the match restarted i sincerely hope sirius has given the team a good cheering on i think he has cos there goes james potter grinning looks like he has a new outlook on the game let just hope he saves some goals now cassie resumed commentating james stole possession from mcnair avoided a bludger sent at him from one of the stormen brothers both were slytherin beaters he then did an exquisite turn and scored 80 40 he raced back to the goals just as dimolen gained possession he raced as quickly as possible and took care to cover all the posts dimolen passed to clorken who shot james lunged and saved it loud cheers erupted from the surprised crowd as he grinned and took off with the quaffle careful to avoid clorken angry glare with no where to go he passed to kira who passed to cindy who took aim but unfortunately flint pulled off a magnificent save ahhh that a shame such a good shot from foster but sadly an equally good save from slytherin captain flint oh wait what this he too busy celebrating and the quaffle misses the outstretched hands of mcnair intercepted by potter who passes back to foster who scores 80 50 gryffindor making a comeback james flew quickly back to the posts high fiving foster and wood on the way receiving a wink from sirius he flew close to lily in the stands and gave her an arrogant grin whatcha think of that evans he smiled before racing to the goalposts and performing yet another stupendous save lily laughed at his arrogance but didnttake it seriously as she was too absorbed in the nail biting match ten minutes later the slytherin seeker avery was desperately searching for the snitch the score was 80 70 and if he found it the gryffindor comeback would be instantly foiled just then he saw kingston take a sudden dive thinking he d seen the snitch avery dashed after him realizing too late that he was being tricked he hit the floor with a thump and glared at kingston who was hovering above him laughing before he turned and circled the pitch from above the others growling avery tried to ignore the laughing and taunts from the gryffindor fans and rushed after him to look for the snitch wronksy feint bloody brilliant kingston james yelled out whilst racing towards the goals to save an oncoming shot from dimolen grabbing on to his room with one hand james flipped over and kicked the quaffle away with barely the toe of his foot and a fantastic save from potter best of the match i d say not quite the season though cos i sure gregory corner will remember my amazing save from the match earlier in the year cassie said grinning you sound like potter murtlebank mcgonagall scolded oh miss you know quidditch players all a bunch of arrogant oh oh sorry professor ok ok a bunch of arrogant fools then anyway wait look at potter go what brilliant flying he caught up with the quaffle after he kicked it and he grabbed it and oh yess gryffindor score again what a brilliant series of plays man of the match james potter and the gryffindors are unstoppable now two quick goals in succession potter then foster oh and here comes matthews she shoots she scores score gryffindor 100 slytherin 80 kingston find that snitch and he did moments later he was clutching a little gold ball in his fist and madam hooch blew her whistle andd gryffindor winss the cup cassie yelled between tears after wood emerged from the huge group huddle he flew towards her and kissed her soundly the rest of the team hurriedly crowded around her as james was handed the cup fighting hard to hold back tears he lifted it above his head and the crowd roared it was well past midnight and the party was still in full swing girls were surrounding the male players david and cassie were dancing happily and james was recounting his every save to his amused friends ahhh and then i just grabbed on and flicked it away brilliant james sirius said smiling best save ever diya agreed grinning phineas pires of puddlemere united couldnthave pulled off a better save remus said winking at sirius it was sooo good prongs peter piped up and the goal you scored after was even better ivana said amused knowing this would spark off a whole new detailed story oh pleasee dontencourage him iv lily said laughing well i was amazing wow i wouldntbe surprised if i didntneed to go through auror training i could just play professionally james announced dreamily sirius patted him on the back condescendingly and laughed he then exchanged a look with ivana this seemed like a perfect time to tell the others ahem professionally james you had a good match i ll go so far as to say brilliant but please deflate your ego lily huffed interrupting sirius lily you re boyfriend is a superstar just face it love you should feel lucky james kissed her on the cheek but she pushed him away lucky she said raising an eyebrow well you did get the most talented guy in school james answered remus shot diya a glance they could see where this was heading peter however nodded with james oh and you did me a favour did you lily accused softly oh lils lighten up i just saying i mean you should consider yourself pretty lucky to be with the best quidditch player in twenty years albus dumbledore words yeah well everyone knows he just nice to everyone lily muttered under her breath sirius and ivana now looked at each other this was obviously not the time to bring up good news sirius stared at james willing him to apologize and shut up sure getting cocky during the match had done him good but he was meant to chill out after lily would probably murder him and sirius both now what lily speak up what are you saying that i not good james shot back angrily no james i didntsay that i just saying quit being so damn arrogant lily sighed arrogant what my team just won the house cup lily it been five years since we last won it dontyou think i have a reason to be happy happy yes conceited no way remember you werentplaying keeper the whole year cassie got you this far james gasped just what do you think you re insinuating evans i gave cassie a ton of credit i not saying the reason we won was all because of me but dontyou think i deserve to be a little cocky after this prongs mate cocky in the match is one thing sirius said gently james stood up angrily stay out of it padfoot i wanna know what my girlfriend thinks of me lily also got up what i think

unfogging the future lily was sprawled on her bed the next morning it was friday so they only had afternoon classes however it was close to two in the afternoon when she finally opened her eyes they were red and puffy and had dark circles underneath she d barely slept after her fight with james when she finally had it was because she d tired herself out crying she knew sometimes she could be a little bossy but hearing know it all from james the boy she loved was more than she could take although she d heard the phrase from diya at least once a week and sirius about twice a day somehow she hated that james thought of her like that too she rose shaking slightly and took a hot shower when she came out she dressed slowly leaving her hair in loose waves the way james loved it as she stared at herself in the mirror she instantly got angry and tied it back roughly her gaze then fell on the beautiful photo ivana had taken of lily and james after midnight at diya new year party the photographic version of lily and james were laughing and hugging james with a huge grin on his face and lily with a sparkle in her eyes obviously news of the real couple fight hadntyet reached their counterparts she took a deep breath and headed downstairs downstairs in the common room james was slouched in an armchair his face in a scowl he was staring idly at the large lion painting on the wall above the portrait hole thinking deeply his hair as usual looked windswept and his face showed no sign of the usual cheeky grin remus sat nearby reading a book with his arm around diya whom also wore a scowl on her face as she looked at james ivana was sitting on the floor with her work covering the coffee table surrounded by armchairs she had stopped furiously writing chewing on her quill in deep thought although she also had an irritated expression when she glanced at james there was also an obvious sympathy in her eyes sirius and peter were playing a game come on wormtail it ll be a laugh i swear sirius was pleading with a reckless smile playing at his lips no sirius last time we played this i ended up with about fifteen bruises peter looked skeptical and he too had a begging tone to his voice sirius took this as a sign of weakness and went in to seal the deal i wonthurt you i promise you might even win this time peter looked a little hopeful and finally let out a sigh reluctantly he agreed and placed his palms together to put his hands out to meet sirius whose were in the same position when their fingertips were touching and their eyes were locked sirius hand twitched which prompted peter to recoil his own he then giggled at his own nervousness and replaced his hands sirius promptly whacked them and went off into a fit of laughter peter looked angry and tried to smack sirius hands back but the taller boy was too quick he moved his hands and thrashed his friend around the side of his head oww padfoot sirius hit him again and cracked up laughing go on petey try hit me peter foolishly lunged for sirius who through his laughter managed to win and hit him again padfooot peter whined squeakily padfoot quit it will ya wormtail ll have a hernia in a second james bellowed as his eyes stopped boring into the ceiling and distractedly glanced at his friends if it bothers you sirius remarked and kicked his legs onto the table which ivana had just cleared thank god for james shitty mood remus muttered relieved which gained him a smack from diya ivana giggled and sat next to sirius who automatically went to wrap his arm around her shoulders alright love then seeing ivana shocked eyes and the others puzzled expressions sirius quickly saved himself lovelyy little girl this earned him even worse looks so he quickly ruffled ivana hair he neednthave bothered covering up because another distraction in the form of lily was coming down the stairs the group took in a sharp breath and the room filled with awkward silence wha james started and glanced over his shoulder he fell silent as his eyes met lily and he took in her disheveled hair obviously done the way he liked except pulled into a ridiculous bun her eyes were dark and puffy and she was biting her lip as she took a seat with the group you could hear a pin drop as they all sat in uncomfortable quiet for a moment lily could not look at james as she sat with them james however was staring at her trying in vain to send her an apologetic smile rather than apologize formally when she didntlook at him his expression was sad as he stood up shoved his hands into the pockets of his robes and walked out grabbing his bag on the way lily face fell as she finally looked at him now class with your newts fast approaching i have decided to revisit some old charms the colour changing charm has not appeared on the newt examination for the last four years so i suspect it might this year so then please break off into groups of three and practice professor flitwick announced to the class of seventh year gryffindors and slytherins lily diya and ivana instantly attached themselves together whilst the four marauders looked a bit lost oh blast you went last time eh moony guess it my go sirius sighed looking over at the leftover slytherins peter parkinson and his pug faced girlfriend were waiting for another partner and eyed him with equal disgust it alright i ll do it peter said bravely the other looked at him surprised and a little impressed nah petey dontworry about it no padfoot it alright they dontwanna murder me peter cut in laughing sirius grinned back and said well if you insist wormtail thanks mate peter nodded and headed towards a smirking parkinson professor flitwick approached the boys a few moments later writing down the groups black potter and lupin oh no no that wontdo boys miss evans please swap with one of the boys lily avoided james glance awkwardly and they simultaneously got up and switched places at that second both silently agreed they wouldntbe able to be in a group together that day it would ve been torture james breathed a sigh of relief at not being paired with lily and set to work with ivana and diya on the colour changing charm sirius plopped down next to lily and grinned which prompted a small smile james scowled a little but tried to ignore them as remus sat on her other side so lils what your favourite colour sirius asked trying to make conversation oh blue lily answered softly same as james eh lily looked as though she might burst into tears so sirius quickly said he sorry you know lily let out a small laugh and she wiped the corner of her eye discreetly sirius that sweet but you know he not he is he just being a loser he insisted patting her on the back and turning her robes blue again lily laughed a little at this oh sirius what i wouldntdo to take back what i said i d call you pretty stupid then remus put in turning her robes back to black sirius nodded enthusiastically lily alright i ll admit yeah you over reacted a smidge but james was being an arrogant prick and he knew it yeah lils honestly you guys will be fine i mean if the lily and james cantmake it through a fight like this then there no hope for the rest of us sirius added lily couldnthelp but beam at this comment james i just dontsee why you wontapologize diya was saying indignantly because i didn t start it james replied through gritted teeth who cares diya hissed back whilst ivana rolled her eyes that mature she commented pointing her wand at her red textbook turning it green james looked at her with a funny face as if he were about to crack up laughing or burst in to shouts the way i see it i agree with you yeah lily started it lily overreacted blah blah blah but you know it wasntfair what you called her ivana elaborated softly james inhaled angrily and turned diya hair blue james look you guys should just put this past you it so stupid diya sighed and tried to turn her hair back to brown unfortunately she only managed a deep purple ivana started laughing at her and james clicked his tongue impatiently and waved his wand turning her hair to it original state damn it chaterjee are you even gonna pass charms look i know it stupid i wanna work past this but what am i meant to do she wonteven look at me james revealed sadly who cares about charms when i can pass divination and just talk to her diya insisted for once she actually right ivana added diya scowled at her and went to talk to the professor at the front of the class james meanwhile was sadly staring at the back of lily red head with his chin propped up with his arm it ridiculous that i cantstop thinking about her isntit james mused nah i guilty of feeling the same about siriu ivana replied vaguely and suddenly clapped her hand over her mouth realising what she d just said james broke his staring competition with the strands on lily head and gaped at ivana suddenly a giant smirk crept onto his face you like him i knew it he exclaimed shushhh look we haventtold anyone yet but we ve been together for a few days now she explained quickly in hushed tones he likes you you guys are together and you didnttell anyone you didnttell me we were going to after the quidditch but then this whole fight happened and it just didntseem like a good idea blimey this is brilliant you canttell anyone though ok sirius is going to kill me ivana begged no no but once me and lily are sorted touch wood you guys are making a whole speech announcement the works right right ivana agreed rolling her eyes and quickly shushing james again and diya returned and plopped down in her seat we need to talk james announced to lily when he walked into the common room later that day lily nodded i suppose we do i sorry i called you a know it all but you gotta understand i hate being called arrogant especially when i ve tried so hard for you to not be he said in a business like manner which didntseem to go over too well with lily who narrowed her eyes for one james potter i think it pretty insensitive of you not to even talk in private every man and his dog can hear in here and you know it second you were being arrogant and maybe i went overboard calling you that but you never seemed to care as much when i used to well you never care when sirius calls you a know it all that different how is it different lillian he questioned icily because lily shouted i not in love with sirius james was silent as he scuffed his foot on the floor he tried again calming his voice down listen lils you know i didntmean it i mean come on we were fighting over something outrageously ridiculous i know i know but if we re fighting over this who knows what we ll be fighting over in the future lily burst out and then clapped a hand over her mouth james eyes were wide f future he stuttered nervously sirius and remus exchanged worried looks and ivana looked concerned peter had a weird glint in his eye that no one noticed diya was staring at remus after this comment lily immediately looked nervous herself um well i mean you know the future as in in a month or something she tried to backtrack you think of me me in your future james asked his voice soft and his eyes foggy lily bit her lip worriedly um yeah sort of is that bad no james exclaimed quickly it just wow i mean i was always the one serious about us and now wow a small smile had slid onto his face this was instantly returned by lily who was now wrapping a strand of hair around her finger anxiously you mean you re not like freaked out or anything of course not lily wow i cantbelieve we were fighting over idiocy two minutes ago and now james started to look extremely thoughtful james what lily put in hurriedly nothing i was just thinking how lucky i am he replied wrapping her into a warm embrace sirius and ivana exchanged a grin and peter looked a bit scared remus was laughing silently and stretching whilst diya looked at him in a rather offended manner james and lily however were too wrapped up in each other to notice their friends they left the common room hand in hand and meandered down the corridors their fingers entwined james stopped and kissed lily softly on the top of her head and then leaned in close to whisper into her ear i want to marry you lily evans he stated huskily before kissing her sweetly when they broke apart lily eyes looked a little scared but her grin was the widest thing you d ever have seen back in the common room however it was a different story remus diya was saying as he nodded distractedly he was engrossed in a game of wizard chess and was barely listening to her remus diya tried again more urgently not now di remus lupin she warned angrily causing him to jump in his seat blimey diya what with the shouting he asked rubbing his ear we need to talk diya said in a quiet stern voice the two left the common room and headed to the courtyard where they took a seat in the corner remus where do you see us in 5 years time diya asked concernedly remus grinned and answered oh you ll be a supermodel on the front of all the witch weekly and i ll be a successful campaigner for werewolf rights and recognition this barely even earned him a slight smile what if i dontwant to be a supermodel diya challenged in an annoyed voice remus looked a little confused but nodded i didntmean anything by it exactly alright how about a fashion consultant for all the witches in england you could open a boutique or a robes store diya shook her head impatiently no but what if i dontwant to work um well love i guess you d have to get used to begging or something remus said laughing he however trailed off when he realised diya was looking at him pointedly what diya what wrong i mean will you support me if i dontwork sure as long as you end up pursuing something you want remus assured patting her on the back she shrugged him off however no remus you dontget it do you help me out here then diya i want to get married i want to have children i dontwant to work i just want to be a wife and a mother with my parents always working i just didntwant to do the same ok ok so you ll get married and your dreams ll come true remus supplied quickly diya looked if possible more frustrated and shocked as tears began to leak from her eyes that just it remus when i say where do you see us in five years you dontsee us together do you you re not in this relationship the way i am remus hung his head diya i no i dontknow what to tell you tell me the truth tell me that you dontwant to marry me we re not like lily and james are we you never saw a future in us diya said pounding him on the chest with her fists as she collapsed into sobs diya no no that not it i just dontwant to commit yeah well not to me anyway diya finished wiping her eyes roughly no it just we have our whole lives ahead of us i mean you dontusually end up with the person you started going out with in school do you remus said apologetically stroking her hair james and lily will but they re lily and james yeah and we re not diya i really am sorry cantwe just go back to normal maybe i wrong maybe no remus at this point i have to think of my future and if it not going to be with you i see no point in it now it was fun though while it lasted diya interjected sniffling and wiping her eyes again she then sent him a tiny smile i do love you though di remus tried sadly as she turned her back and walked away when she heard this she stopped and after a second she turned around there the difference though isntit rem i was in love with you and you you just loved me loved me like you love lily or ivana or james or sirius except with a bit of making out every now and then hey with that diya turned her shoulders shaking with a silent sob as she walked away from a bewildered remus needless to say it had been a mixed up week for the marauders and their relationships a n i wont be updating unless i get more than 7 reviews if you want more get clicking especially if you haventreviewed before author note thank you all so much for your reviews i started writing as soon as i got 7 reviews but i really sorry i had writer block and couldntround off the chapter it done now sorry if it not as good as some of the others ange yeah i reckon it will get pretty awkward between remus and diya now hehe just read on but that the thing usually when ppl leave school couples who have been together ages break up and its super awkward and that with the group but i think these guys are all just too close to let it bother them and true remus is the sensitive one i dontthink i really portrayed him the way i wanted but he is sensitive and sensible in most things i think he just realised diya wasntthe one exactly anyway generally speaking i think diya and remus broke up on ok terms haha anyway thanks soooo much for reviewing jami i know the marauder and relationships eh hahaha i just kinda wanted to point out the differences in relationships lily and james are more real than remus and diya if you know what i mean oh and i sure ivana and sirius will spread the news within good time too many awkward things keep happening tho thanks for the review heather gernenz thanks for reviewing again yeah i always think it a sign of true friendship or love or whatever when u can just forget a fight cos you realise what a good friendship relationship it is plus its way cuter than formal apologies haha iamari thanks so much for reviewing here the update surlymermaid hahaha yeh i understand what u mean diya was being annoying i guess but u also gotta give it to her she wanted a future with remus and he didn t it best he got confronted comically insane woahh ahahha heres the update kayla thanks for the compliment yeah i realise sometimes i set high review goals but i think it best to get as many opinions as possible to make the story something the readers will want to read about i d prob update anyway but saying that isntit nice to tell ppl u like their story thanks for reviewing a million ways to be cruel thanks for the question i see you reviewed at chapter 2 so hopefully if u read on you will have seen other ppl put that point up before and i answered it i tried to stay as close to the books as possible like my opinion on how sirius for example was but yeh i made the mistake with james not being headboy cos i think in the 5th book when sirius says i spent too much time in detention with james threw me off plus i really wanted to make the whole lily and james getting together different seems too easy with them both being head students hahaha anyway thanks for reviewing sorry for the mistake hope the story is still bareable ok and after that hugeee reply to the reviewers hope i dontget in trouble for that on with the story thanks again for allll your reviews much appreciated if you continue to do so ta a heart wrenching disaster it was the end of may remus and diya were awkward around each other there was no way to avoid it there were either sullen and not speaking or overly polite but cold with newts approaching fast all the seventh years were busily cramming with less than a week until the exams ivana and sirius had decided to still conceal their relationship with remus and diya so upset over their break up they saw no sense is pouring salt over fresh wounds expecto patronus diya answered unsurely almost di it patronum lily explained patiently ohhh i not even going to get a single acceptable no no mate you ll pass dontworry sirius put in uncharacteristically because remus had discreetly prompted him diya looked up with a smile but it faltered when she had registered who the assurance had actually come from thanks rem she said softly he smiled sadly himself and returned to his transfiguration notes sirius unable to take the awkward moment pretended to be offended excuse me diya but i do believe i was the one who made you feel better the others laughed a little glad at the ice breaker and diya grinned sincerely for the first time in weeks if you say so sirius james let out a huge exasperated sigh and slammed his potions book shut lilyyy he whined which made her roll her eyes james i cantdo this i ve been studying this potions chapter for hours and hours and hours cantwe just go and hang out in the sunshine for a bit he asked hopefully james yes you can do this you have not been studying for hours it only been a bit more than ten minutes and no we cannot go hang out outside because well it a distraction lily said her face reddening a little at the last sentence sirius grinned at this and put in with a smirk yeah sex is a huge distraction lily threw him a look and went if possible an even darker scarlet while james gasped and threw a book at his friend head shut up padfoot if you ask me a little sex would do us all a bit of good this time ivana smacked him sharply across the head sirius shut up james widened his grin even more and said cheekily yeh sirius listen to the missus sirius eyes blazed angrily as ivana shot him a worried pleading look oh james give the kids a break we ve all established that they are just friends and i d rather not hear sirius yell again remus elaborated tiredly yeah sirius agreed feebly oh okk james said slyly sending ivana a wink although the others didntnotice this exchange lily did and spoke up james potter exactly what do you think you re suggesting oh miss evans it not so much suggesting as it is pointing out james sirius said with a warning tone padfoot james replied in the same tone leave it what a hinkypunk peter asked stupidly ivana was thankful to tell him the information they d learnt in third year to avoid continuing the previous topic james potter just what d you think you re playing at sirius hissed in his friend ear later that day ivana was close beside him you guys just tell them already remus and diya arentgonna kill you for being happy we ll tell them soon james ivana assured him sure you will he answered sceptically sirius on the other hand said we will yes tonight thank god james breathed a sigh of relief while sirius looked troubled and rather scared ivana squeezed his shoulder reassuringly and rushed off to catch up with the girls dontbe a coward padfoot ahhhh shut ya face sirius said pushing james just as remus and peter joined them they didnttell them however there was too much bad news that night there had been a mass murder by the death eaters a murde r which hit home at hogwarts more so than any of the other murders the prewett and mckinnon families had been killed in cold blood relatives at hogwarts were mourning sobbing breaking stuff or simply sitting still in shock the marauders and the girls sat uncomfortably together in the common room lily was curled up and clinging tightly on to james who was staring at the floor and absently stroking her hair diya had tears in her eyes as remus put aside their differences to try to soothe her as she hiccupped through tears remus sadly stroked her back diya family had been close family friends with the mckinnons and they saw the prewetts from time to time remus himself was shocked he couldntimagine what molly weasley was feeling at the moment she was the last of the prewetts her brothers and parents were dead remus took a shaky breath and silently thanked god that molly was married to arthur and had three children already if anything this blow might be softened by that fact peter was fiddling nervously and looked perhaps the most scared of them all ivana was staring at diya crying but lost in her own thoughts the prewetts had been on holiday in bulgaria did that mean you know you was near russia near her parents sirius himself sat with a hardened expression on his handsome face he like james was gazing furiously at the floor could it have been regulus no but regulus was still here at school bellatrix perhaps he cursed himself for being related to such scum a second later the news went from bad to worse jenna polly friend ran in sobbing without looking at anyone she scurried up the stairs with loud wails polly walked in worriedly two seconds later and headed towards the stairs remus stopped and called out to her asking what wrong her parents were murdered in a muggle coffee shop in surrey she answered sadly before she followed her friend to the dormitory jenna was a muggle born just like lily she was also from surrey just like lily a worried look crossed lily face as she sat up straighter sirius had gotten up and was pacing in front of them muttering if i ever get my hands on bella or any death eater for that matter we ll have the locked up and then we ll finish him james finished darkly just then professor mcgonagall entered the common room everyone held their breath each silently hoping she had not come to deliver bad news to them silently hoping she would not single out someone new silently begging her to just be there to comfort jenna but their silence did nothing professor mcgonagall sadly started walking across the room every group she passed gave an audible sigh of relief until she reached the marauders sirius looked at her a frozen expression on his face what if what if it was james parents they were practically his own james himself turned around to look at the professor his eyes pleading with her remus took in a sharp breath his father had died when he was young if it was his mother his mother had raised him all by herself peter held pure fright in his eyes his mother and father how would he live without them diya had just talked to her parents so she was a little less scared than the others however she was apprehensive knowing in a moment one of her friends lives would change it was a double whammy miss evans miss petrova professor dumbledore would like to see you mcgonagall announced quietly placing a motherly hand on each of the girls shoulders no lily breathed her voice cracking no james no tell me no please oh god she said sobbing and beating james chest with her fists he wrapped her protectively in his arms and rocked her as she cried his eyes were broken as he and professor mcgonagall exchanged a sympathetic and heartbroken glance he stood with lily as she clung to him and asked her softly d you want me to come lily wiped her eyes roughly her face red and puffy and thought before she slowly shook her head at james she then leaned weakly against a supportive professor mcgonagall and resumed crying ivana on the other hand seemed to have not shown any emotion her sparkling blue eyes were now dull and glazed over as she watched lily shake and she seemed to be in a daze when sirius placed a hand on her shoulder she placed her own over his and shut her eyes tightly her heart breaking as the transfiguration teacher began to lead lily out looking concernedly at ivana as she waited for her ivana took a deep breath and squeezed sirius hand so tight it turned rather white he didntbreak away however until she finally let go and slowly followed the professor trying to avoid the sympathetic pitiful looks she and lily were receiving through out the room hello ivana wontyou take a seat dumbledore said politely as the blonde haired girl with a suddenly pale white face entered his office thank you sir miss petrova i simply cannot express my complete and utter remorse at the tragedy which has just occurred i m i so sorry ivana your parents were murdered by the death eaters making their way back from bulgaria i cannot tell you how sorry i am and my deepest condolences are with you thank you sir if if you should ever need to thank you sir ivana cut in her voice cracking this time professor dumbledore placed a warm hand on her shoulder as the first tear trickled down her pale face she squeezed her eyes shut trying to stop the flow but they continued to fall a sob escaped and soon she was clinging to the old wizard who hugged her in a comforting fatherly way finally she cleared her throat and stood up wiping her face thank you sir i i have to go now of course with that she walked slowly from the room stopping only to hug a still sobbing lily who went in after her after she turned a corner she broke into a run she ran past gryffindor tower and a worried looking sirius and james past the prefect bathroom where a shaken remus and peter stood at the door whilst diya washed her tear stained face inside past the grand hall and outside to the beech tree she then collapsed onto the ground and shook howling with sadness she cried until her throat was tight and she felt she might vomit she cried until a tough looking boy with gleaming messy black hair and hardened grey eyes took her into his arms and hugged her so tight she began to feel a little safer lily had a completely different experience in professor dumbledore office the minute she entered and saw a devastated headmaster looking at her with empathy she leaned against the wall and slid down she had not stopped wailing with tears the whole way through the castle and now was no exception dumbledore bent his old knees and took a place on the floor beside her something she ordinarily might have been shocked at but now could not have been more thankful for lily your parents were the some of kindest muggles i have ever had the pleasure to meet the moment they accepted you were a witch and made you promise to be the best i could not imagine how wonderful their daughter would turn out you my dear lily are proof for what wonderful people they were the attack at the station to innocent muggles was one by a coward if lord voldemort would only open his eyes to the treasures that are muggles and muggleborns he would realise just how special you all are oh professor i hate him i i how can someone be like that great power what will i do without them lily wondered between fresh cries i told them about james they so wanted to meet him and now now the headmaster could say nothing but embrace her in the same way he had done with ivana lily sobbed into his chest and finally pulled away roughly something needs to be done it will be miss evans i can assure you it will be when lily emerged from the headmaster office she saw james waiting for her with worry etched all over his face she hurled herself into his arms and clung on tightly promise you ll never leave me willingly never he exclaimed his voice strained as he cupped her chin and looked her defiantly in the eyes you d have loved them they d have loved you james just hugged her tightly i ll kill the bastard we ll bring him down if it the last thing he needs to be stopped he will be a n sad eh review please author note thanks for all the great long reviews with praise ange ahhh thanks soo much im smiling like mad

its soooo longg so be happy yeh hahah and review please the last goodbyes life at hogwarts had noticeably dull after the news of the mass murders however it was safe to say it had been relatively calm in the days leading up to their first newt examination lily sometimes cried herself to sleep often having bad dreams but the fact that james was there could not have comforted her more sometimes she wondered how she could ve ever disliked him at this point it seemed there was no one better for her than james potter ivana seemed to be acting fairly normal considering the whole predicament she was in that being said there were often moments where she went a little sullen and quiet but no one seemed to want to push her to talk least of all sirius he knew better than anyone that sometimes being left alone was the best medicine lily busied herself with studying with remus whilst ivana and sirius took it on themselves to help diya james then as usual lent peter a hand with as much as he could he was however getting a little frustrated with ivana and sirius continuing secrecy regarding their relationship he knew it would cheer ivana up immensely and at least cast a lighter mood around the time of exams so the night before their first exam transfiguration james pestered sirius when are you gonna tell them mate i dunno bit of a weird time dontyou think no i actually think it the perfect time ivana wanted to tell us for ages why cantyou just tell them sirius i dunno you need a new vocabulary mate james said as ivana settled beside them leaving diya to memorise some incantations what this about she asked interestedly about you and sirius finally goin public ivana face seemed to light up for once when he said this but quickly regained it cool as she glanced at sirius scared expression well whenever he ready i am love it just james smiled at sirius slip of love and gave him a wink finally sirius broke into a reluctant smile alright then iv let tell them shall we ivana beamed as she got up and held his hand the remaining four friends looked up with interest what this about then remus asked gaining a nod of agreement from peter wait why are you two holding hands lily questioned slowly i knew it diya squealed with delight ivana grinned and squeezed sirius hand who looked rather dazed at their reactions ivana lifted their clasped together hands to show the others we ve been together almost a month now she said with a smile lily joined the squealing and remus beamed happily james thumped sirius hard on the back and walked over the happy lily she hugged him and then rushed to hug ivana and flung herself at sirius i cantbelieve you ve kept this from us well we wanted to ivana answered carefully but things kept coming up sirius finished for her his hand a little sweaty as ivana clasped it but his voice containing a hint of laughter good on you padfoot remus exclaimed clapping him jovially on the back while diya squeezed ivana into a tight overjoyed giggly hug peter looked a little frightened at the prospect of yet another close couple and he involuntarily shivered before offering his congratulations so that night everyone slept fairly well well as well as you can if you have an important exam the next day it was a nice occasion to hear about two well suited friends finally getting together even at times of trauma diya was on the verge of tears as she attempted the last few potions questions with five minutes left she was full of horribly mixed up emotions on one hand she hated potions and knew she was doing terribly in the exam it was likely she wouldnteven finish however there was certainly an upside of only having five minutes remaining it was the last newt and the whole year was exhausted the school having crammed all exams into one single week apparently it was exam protocol but no one really saw the fairness in it unfortunately professor mcgonagall seemed to have no hesitation in awarding any complainer a detention despite it being the last few weeks of school sirius had already secured about four and james two in the last days the seventh years would be signing up for job opportunities and tying up loose ends until they graduated although there was no ceremony everyone expected the marauders to have a leaving stunt prepared graduated mature and 18 years old or not remus carefully checked his answers but even the usually meticulous boy was far too restless as the hourglass indicated four minutes left professor slughorn paced the length of the great hall peering over members of the slug club work every now and then and beaming if they d gotten something correct remus felt sleepy as he found himself watching severus snape wipe a bead of greasy sweat off his forehead remus grimaced with disgust and cast a quick look at sirius who was nearby he was doing the exact same thing he always did in every final five minutes of any exam lounging casually in his seat looking haughtily at those who were hurriedly trying to finish their paper he flicked his hair off his eyes elegantly and quietly laughed mockingly at snape shooting a conspiring look with remus who tried to ignore him when sirius realised moony wouldntlaugh he raked back his chair to make a sharp annoying noise james immediately perked up from his slouched over position on the table he d obviously been sleeping over his finished exam paper he exchanged a grin with sirius and threw a revolted expression at the greasy slytherin a few chairs to his right when he turned the other way wearing a huge smile he was met with a glare from lily who had obviously finished but was re reading every sentence until she noticed sirius and her boyfriend mocking their favourite victim when james saw the glare he quickly ducked down and leant on his arms trying to sleep again as the hourglass hit two minutes remaining peter shuffled nervously in his seat he mimicked the actions of the relaxed marauders however he had left the last few questions he tried to catch sirius eye hopefully in case his friend could give him any clues but he was far too busy watching ivana tuck her blonde hair repeatedly behind her ears and push her fringe off her face so that it stuck up not really caring what it looked like sirius still thought it was beautiful your time is up accio parchments slughorn announced and all the papers came zooming forward and landed on his desk the students shuffled excited in their seats waiting to leave the hall and celebrate one however celebrated early woooooooooooooooooooohoooo sirius yelled jumping to his feet and doing a little jig ivana slapped her head embarrassedly but still looked vaguely amused mr black please wait until you re dismissed slughorn shouted scandalised but professor we re done finished khalas finite fini finished mr black wooohooo sirius yelled again and ran from the back of the hall threw the doors removing his robes and shirt on the way he twirled it over his head and headed outside running with only a quick salute in acknowledgement with slughorn who sighed dismissed i suppose he said pompously rolling his big eyes and smoothening his short almost walrus like moustache the seventh years laughed some hurrying to see sirius display others simply walking slowly with huge smiles on their face they all however got to the trees near the lake just in time to witness sirius black somersaulting headfirst in with a large whoop of delight no one paused to think that he d obviously waited until they had reached him to put on his show attention seeker james thought laughing at his best mate who was now fountaining water out of his mouth in an imitation of a whale as he floated on his back james then looked around hell so was he so he too dived in and joined a delighted sirius in the water a week later in mid june the carriages were awaiting the leaving students who were all still gathered in the grand hall for the leaving feast there was excited chatter from the younger ones talking of summer plans older ones dreading all the holiday homework they were to complete and the seventh years lamenting over their experience at hogwarts most of them had eaten quickly and run around to all their friends hugging saying their goodbyes and promising to keep in touch remus was hugging marilee of ravenclaw well mar have a good life hey send us an owl sometime of course remus good luck with everything good luck with your wedding say congrats to diggory for me wontyou remus said over his shoulder as we waved and sauntered off to say bye to a nearby hufflepuff diya was rushing around kissing each of her old boyfriends cheeks ohh cheeky finnigan you have a great time too we made it eh well let hope i get at least one newt lily was caught in a huge crowd as she tearfully said goodbye to all the prefects the role of head girl had certainly invested many a friendship and it was obvious lily would be sorely missed she then came across wood dave she said flinging herself into his arms for a hug alright god it feels weird leaving doesntit oh hello cassie hiya lils a very pregnant cassie wood said as she linked her arm with her grinning husband well lily it was a right pleasure hanging out with you stay in touch oh and we ll send you a picture of the baby maybe when you have one of your own they can be playmates and that david joked james walked up and slid his arm around lily waist and answered oh definitely they ll both be the best quidditch players gryffindor seen since well us he laughed and kissed lily on the cheek who rolled her eyes at the mention of quidditch and giggled love can i see you outside in a minute i just want to talk to the quidditch team first he whispered in her ear huskily alright then i ll just go say bye to mrs pince and the library committee there was a library committee james you idiot she smiled and walked off to a quiet group who were locked in a tight group hug they instantly parted to make way for the friendly head girl and crushed her too in the quiet hug james watched for a moment with a bemused expression on his face and then addressed the quidditch team well lads ahem cassie put in with nods from cindy foster and kira matthews and um lasses i just want to tell you what a honour it been leading you lot for the past three years i ve never met such brilliant sportspeople or great friends or just downright bloody amazing people so thanks ta very much guys james said awkwardly but wearing a grin the girls all looked teary as the team hugged and said their goodbyes how emotional prongs sirius said pretending to wipe a tear away and then grabbed him in a tight hug leggofme you nut i seeing you tomorrow yes but think how hard it ll be waiting that long idiot i hurt prongs sirius shouted after james who had headed towards lily and lead her outside by the lake he then turned to receive kisses from foster and matthews and hand shakes from the boys and a hug from cassie cassie love you better knock the socks of puddlemere you got that once you ve popped that baby and all will do sirius will do she said chuckling and hitting him playfully on the arm oh and kingston dontbe a prat captain like james was sirius added loudly to the team seeker i heard that black james shouted just before he stepped outside i meant him to sirius said winking at his team mated who laughed he then bounded off to hug a startled remus and hurried past him to grab ivana and twirl her around happily remus rolled his eyes you re seeing us all tomorrow padfoot why does everyone keep saying that i showing you how much i ll miss you ivana laughed and ruffled his hair and then turned to finish her conversation with some fellow gryffindors sirius didntwait too hyper with excitement until he spotted peter nervously shaking hands with a slytherin he then raged forward raised his eyebrow at peter and said alright death eaters there were some prompt scowls after this comment and peter looked rather frightened seeing this look sirius rolled his eyes and flung himself onto his brother regulus who had just appeared ohhh reggie i going to miss you he said hugging his brother tightly with a huge air of sarcasm in his voice regulus however was not amused as he shoved his brother off and smoothed his much shorter black hair sirius let go and grinned flicking his longish hair off his eyes donttouch me blood traitor regulus spat angrily you can still come to the other side reggie leave these fools leave voldy it ll all be fine sirius pleaded mockingly knowing exactly what his brother would do there was a flicker of fright or doubt on his face but sirius wasntsure his expression then turned dark as he drew his wand avery nott and snape also produced their wands and snarled at the grinning sirius peter backed off and stole a glance at sirius who although grinning was holding his wand out in front of him come now lads you wouldntdare show some of those death eater curses in front of the teachers and dumbledore would you seeing his point the four slytherins growled and lowered their wands darting annoyed glances at the nearby professors saying goodbye to the students tarantallegra stupefy petrificus totalus sirius shouted through a smile he then looked at snape who was momentarily shocked that he hadntyet been cursed oh and my favourite for you snapey boy secumt snape began maliciously but was suddenly cut off by bubbles protruding from his mouth and foamy soap covering his greasy hair and face as his eyes burnt with the continuous bubbles coming from his mouth he couldntdo anything but glare at a triumphant sirius scourgify snivellus m boy professor mcgonagall was right non verbal spells will help more than you think he said with a smirk he then turned to peter but found the transfiguration teacher herself there peter had stumbled off to find remus when the duel had began oh hello minnie see i did learn something in your class sirius black how dare you finite incanteum be off now boys and you sirius yes miss he asked innocently deten nooo miss no detentions left to give he said cheekily hugging her tightly around her waist a bright red blush crept onto her face before she pushed him off oh no go help load the students trunks onto the baggage carriage oh minnie sirius sighed but winked and ran off to pounce on filch who gave him a look of pure hatred getting a little scared sirius sidled away to pick up the trunks and began loading them really miss petrova i honestly do not know how you manage ivana laughed sometimes neither do i miss lily had her eyes closed as she leant back on james chest while they sat under their tree one last time she inhaled his scent and looked up sadly at the castle which had been her home for so many years she had tears in her eyes oh lils baby you re crying james stated worriedly only cos i going to miss this place james and i so happy i happy too i love you i love youu lily smiled at the passer bys as they beamed and waved at the affectionate couple um lily mmm all romanticisms aside you know you ve made me the happiest bloke in the world right lily turned to look at him and smiled again contently to show she felt the same so um he started nervously running his hand through his hair and ruffled it a bit james you haventdone that in ages i know it not as ludicrous as i thought it sort of cute actu lily i trying to ask you something well ok then shoot no you cantsay shoot it ll ruin it ruin what james nothing he got up nervously and pulled her up with him she narrowed her eyes and looked at him expectantly well potter evans what he then cleared his throat and got to one knee she looked at him puzzled and knelt down with him lily no get up will you james potter what are you doing just get up evans james lily oh alright alright hurry up we ll be late she said getting to her feet god lily you really make it difficult for a lad to propose huh what ohhh yeah took you long

emerald ring onto her slender finger i told you i wanted to marry you lily they returned to the entrance of hogwarts hand in hand there were thousands of squeals not only from ivana and diya when lily showed them her engagement ring boys clapped james heartily on the back as they headed towards the awaiting carriages peter stuttered his goodbyes to the teachers and shook hands with dumbledore warmly before heading off to save a carriage for his friends and himself diya shook hands with each of her professors and hugged the divination professor thank you miss divination was always my favourite ahh yes m dear you did seem to posses a certain quality i shall remember you i retiring you know you ve only been here two years miss well run along dear good luck diya nodded and waved at dumbledore who tipped his hat at her she then stood waiting for ivana thank you professor flitwick mcgonagall i dontthink i would ve passed if it werentfor you ah ivana you always worked hard though you found the subjects difficult good luck with your photography career oh yes miss petrova ivana i do say i might peek into witch weekly to see your photos mcgonagall added to flitwick praise with a smile ivana grinned and approached dumbledore who she swiftly hugged and whispered a thanks and rushed off with diya they both cast one last look at the castle and climbed into the carriage with peter remus went next he graciously thanked each of his professors who congratulated him and wished him the best professor dumbledore i cannot tell you how much your acceptance of me at hogwarts has meant i eternally grateful sir pleasure remus i can only say i am completely honoured to have been in such close contact with one of my best students thank you for attempting to keep black and potter in check the old man eyes twinkled as he smiled broadly well sir lily there to keep an eye on james now and sirius well i dontthink anyone can stop him the staff laughed along with remus as the group all turned to watch sirius drag peter out of the carriage and use the first year spell of wingardium leviosa to levitate him and make him fly around near the carriages all the students chuckled at sirius behaviour and as remus headed towards them with a wave to the teachers sirius headed back letting remus catch wormtail oh gods mcgonagall muttered under her breath thank you professor professor professor i charmed i sure professor flitwick prof abelian i promise to send you that magical properties of the number seven homework tomorrow sir professor never had you but thanks miss ahhh and of course my favourite professor mcgonagall if you forgive me for being so hilarious and troublesome the last seven years i ll forgive you for giving me possibly the most last minute detention ever no honestly miss thanks you re most certainly welcome good luck dontneed it miss he said with a wink he then approached professor dumbledore and proceeded to give him a long speech oh professor what will i do without you re twinkling blue eyes rain will surely fall from the skies i cannot remember a thing you said in latin but i remember the first words from you i heard tuck in now if only you and professor minnie would get married the world would be happier much less hurried professor dumbledore chuckled and wiped a tear of laughter from his eye oh mr black you do amuse me i dare say you all shall not have heard the last from me is that a threat professor sirius asked with mock shock which earned him another laugh and he had to duck a smack from mcgonagall abuse abuse he shrieked as he ran back to remus and peter you d think he d have matured in seven years mcgonagall said in awe james chuckled and thanked his teachers lily followed slowly spending much longer with each professor slughorn seemed to be wiping a tear away as he hugged her oh my dear you were always the best potion maker i will miss your little jokes james grinned at lily but she still looked sad as she moved on to say bye to mcgonagall and then flitwick thank you professor mcgonagall i owe so much of my magical knowledge to you james thanked quietly oh my dear boy you were always the most gifted transfiguration student i d had rather arrogant at times rather mischievous at times rather black like at times but i thoroughly enjoyed teaching you good luck good luck with your future with lily thanks miss he said with a grin as he joined lily talking to professor dumbledore a pleasure sir james shook hands with the headmaster as he put an arm around lily shoulders i wish you two all the happiness in the world i sincerely hope to see you all soon i will be sending an owl to you and each of your friends in due course congrats you two really are the brightest witch and wizard i have met in a long time lily looked choked up and james looked utterly flattered they both nodded and waved as they headed towards the carriages there was a few minutes as the last few people boarded and now only james sirius remus and peter stood outside looking at the castle with a huge exchange of grins each raised their wands to spell out one final message from the marauders messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs would like to offer their deepest thanks to hogwarts good luck to all who are leaving have fun to all who are staying these years have been the best of our lives finally one last time mischief managed the marauders james wrote the words whilst sirius manipulated the clouds into a gryffindor lion remus added stars and peter swirls with one final bow to the applause they received the marauders climbed into the carriage and set off they left behind their pranks their books their beds and a taster of their humour and charm they ended one chapter of their lives and began the next they were into the real world and in that moment none of the occupants of that carriage focused on the disasters occurring they simply focused on remembering remembering what an amazing time

words and extended her hand to his parents with a warm nervous smile she was staying with the potters until james and she got a place of their own but it was the first time she d met them so she was rather nervous well lily it a pleasure to meet you my dear mr potter said shaking her hand with a grin on his face which instantly reminded her of james this immediately calmed her nerves slightly all her anxiety however was abolished the minute mrs potter crushed her into a warm embrace saying ohhh lily we ve heard so much about you oh and you re beautiful please please have a seat lily grinned and took the place next to james on the cream sofa in the sunny living room while margaret potter busied herself with getting some tea fred potter sat in the chair opposite the engaged couple and started asking questions so lily evans wow james has been on about you since third year a lot to live up to you have he said with a wink lily giggled and turned slightly pink as she shot a look at james who merely smiled and draped an arm around her shoulders well sir i certainly hope i up for it this earned a laugh from james father and approving smile was shot at james mrs potter was now pushing a plate of biscuits and a mug of tea into lily hands and with a huge smile said shush freddy she a star i can tell already i know margaret i know so lily are you planning on becoming an auror like our james then by the way son you ll need to sign that application i ve left in your room i added my reference when you owled it to me last week i ll hand it in sometime tomorrow right cool dad well lily wants to work at the ministry too but she doesntwanna be an auror oh really what do you want to do then my dear well sir if you ll excuse me for saying so the ministry isntexactly the most reliable of places anymore lily began not at all dear dumbledore and i have this conversation about once a week mr potter said jovially yes absolutely despicable margaret added harshly but sent an encouraging smile at lily to continue damn bloody right james put in before she resumed talking which made his mother glare at his language james potter mum i only said damn this earned him yet another sharp look lily chuckled yes well i ve thought about it a lot and i ve applied for a position in the wizarding and muggle relations department i really like working with people and well i honestly think i d like to put out the message that a murderous wizard is out there the ministry shouldntbe ignoring it she exclaimed passionately well i never thought much of the girls james and sirius brought home but you ve got yourself a keeper here jamesie boy james father said impressed at her speech dadd james whined looking a little embarrassed as lily gave him a teasing poke oh you should meet iv as well sirius is head over heels i dare say he wontadmit it either mrs potter exclaimed with a knowing tut tut lily giggled and nodded oh ivana petrova yes she was lovely we met her at the chaterjee new year party i remember shame about her family mr potter looked extremely troubled and suddenly looked as though he felt even worse when james sent him a glare and margaret gave him a shove oh lily oh i terribly sorry that was a tragedy with your parents he looked extremely concerned as lily met him with her emerald eyes yes sir but please dontworry about it i just glad i have james mr potter still looked sorry but a little more relieved so who wants dinner andd who d like to discuss the wedding mrs potter announced breaking the silence lily and james mum squealed and hurried to the table whilst the two men looked amused but rather weary at the thought remus was unpacking his last box when there was a knock at the door he quickly dusted off his hands and crossed the small homely flat newly carpeted floor to the front door and swung it open sirius stood in the doorway leaning against the frame with a lopsided smile on his face his hair was messier than usual and he had traces of stubble on his face alright neighbour he said in a funny voice coming into the apartment remus had rented the flat directly opposite the one sirius owned and he could already see his friend would probably be over at all times he chuckled at the prospect and left sirius to plonk onto his sofa and put his feet up to cross the hallway into sirius open flat sirius had owned the place far longer than remus had leased his but there were still boxes everywhere the only visible thing he could see that sirius had unpacked was three photographs which stood on the small table next to the leather sofa in the middle of the bare room one was of the seven of them on their last day at hogwarts they were all grinning and waving at the camera with a perfect view of the castle in the background sirius with his arms around lily and diya as ivana was being crushed in a hug by remus and james peter had offered to take the picture and so had caught sirius blowing kisses at the camera remus laughed as he remembered the reason for this was because professor mcgonagall had been standing beside peter as he did this the next photo was an extremely funny one ivana had taken of the marauders they all had their arms around each other sirius ruffling james hair and holding remus in a headlock peter was kneeling on the floor laughing in front of them with sirius knee holding him down it had been the day where sirius had heard of some wizard named serayus the conqueror in the history of magic he had been so taken by the likeness of the name he d begged the marauders to let him pose like the warrior they were all rolling their eyes at sirius triumphant expression but grinning nonetheless the last was an artistic timed shot ivana took of her and sirius by the lake he had his arms wrapped around her waist and she was looking at him with a smile as he stared into her eyes the sun in the picture was glinting as the couple in the photo smiled at each other remus turned to see sirius behind him grinning she d kill me if she saw this stubble you know he was saying as he rubbed his scratchy chin but no more school no more rules remus laughed and as if on queue ivana apparated into the flat she threw sirius a disgusted look as he headed to kiss her sirius black if you think i kissing that face you have got another thing coming oh come on love it looks manly scary more like ivana muttered oh hello rem all settled better than this fool she said indicating sirius with her head when remus had nodded i resent that ivana ignored him anyway i here to enlist your help me and diya are a bit overwhelmed with all the unpacking so d you reckon you can come give us a hand yeah sure give me a sec remus agreed and crossed the hall to lock his door which sirius had without doubt left wide open you know ivana unpacking it sorta needs some manly strength and if i go shave off my beard then you ll just be stuck with a weakling sirius said slyly in a slow voice putting on a pout ivana laughed and kissed him briefly you git well i s pose it isnttoo bad he gave an exaggerated roar of triumph and pulled her in for another kiss remus walked in at that moment and gave a little cough which broke them apart quickly although he was grinning and sirius had a sheepish smile ivana was positively horrified she hated public displays of affection least of all when she d just called her boyfriend a hairy beast without waiting a second longer she apparated with a pop nice one padfoot ahh i was always the ladies man lets go remus rolled his eyes and laughed sure you were mate and wait a jif to at least lock up you git he then apparated to diya and ivana flat leaving sirius looking annoyed ohoo why bother with this locking business he said exasperatedly then realising the stupidity in his own comment he sent a spell at the door to lock it and apparated away diya sat on the floor sobbing when ivana returned di why are you crying she sniffled as she sat in front of one of the boxes clutching a photograph ivana was afraid it would be one of remus so she looked at it apprehensively she then burst into a fit of giggles you re joking right noo sniff i sniff misss it diya replied wiping her eyes and staring at the photo of her mansion just look at this dump ivana even if we do manage to unpack how will it ever look like home ivana sighed oh di dontbe such a dramaqueen ok so it wontbe a beautiful mansion but it ll be ours how brilliant is that diya sniffed and a small smile played on her lips yeah i guess idiot ivana said affectionately as she pulled her friend into a hug two loud cracks were heard as remus and sirius arrived in the flat when sirius saw the two girls embracing he sat in an armchair and conjured up a bag of sweets as he watched with wide eyes oi rem good show eh have a bean remus rolled his eyes and looked rather awkwardly at diya as ivana and she separated ughh sirius you re such a guy ivana said disgustedly thanks babe that what it said on the birth certificate i think i preferred it when he brooded ivana mused rolling her eyes and throwing a pillow at sirius who playfully headed it back at her ahem anyway you guys need help remus asked politely yeah thanks rem if you can start with those boxes that d be great diya said smiling the three got to work as sirius lounged in the arm chair looking bored ivana sirius she gave him a deathly glare um yeh nevermind remus remus sighed heavily and asked what now padfoot erm hang on i dontwant a scary wolf on my hands this earned him an irritated glare so he quickly turned to diya diya mate yes sirius why are you guys acting like muggles the three young adults looked at sirius wearily questioning his comment uh hello we re not like 4th years we re in the real world now sirius said giving them all a condescending look as he got to his feet and drew out his wand locomotor diya and ivana stuff he waved his wand in a complicated fashion and directed the objects quickly to their places with household items flying above their heads the others ducked and sent sirius annoyed looks he didntseem to notice them as everything finally came to a standstill in its correct place he then grinned at the others who looked a little sulky now for some decoration he announced waving his wand turning everything in the apartment violet and black ugh how depressing this isntyour place sirius diya whined god no wonder he never bothered unpacking while he was alone he needed to show off in front of everyone remus stated and then waved his wand so the room turned into warm shades of scarlet and gold hmm not bad but i trying to get away from the whole school spirit stuff diya said with a smile and waved her wand instantly the room colours changed to green and silver hmm so instead you thought you d go all slytherin on us sirius mocked while she looked confused oh enough ivana burst in a fed up voice she concentrated and waved her wand turning the room into cool shades of blue and calming sea green with white sofas and light tables perfect diya exclaimed collapsing onto a chair remus agreed and patted ivana on the back and joined diya sitting sirius stood behind ivana looking sulky well sure it easy for an artist and that shut it sirius she said giving him a rare public kiss on the cheek two weeks later sirius was rushing madly around his flat looking for something with a crack james apparated directly in and looked at him puzzedly dude we have to be at auror training in literally five minutes sirius looked up from the box he was rummaging through and stared at james with a weird expression on his face he then started laughing like a madman at his friend whose usually messy mop of hair was neatly combed down with water or at least margaret potter had attempted to comb it down defiant pieces were sticking out all over the place giving james a rather ridiculous appearance ok ok padfoot i just needed to get out the house relax he said with a sigh and messed up his hair so that it looked as though he d just won a quidditch match aww but prongs you looked so sweet sirius mocked as he returned to his searching what are you looking for would you believe my wand considering it you and the state of this flat yes oi sirius you idiot forget something last night remus said walking into the room and tossing his wand at him thanks moony he said catching it in one swift movement alright moony ready for the goblins james asked aghh dontremind me wish i was doing something as interesting as you so come join auror training you fool you were top of defence against the dark arts for gods sake what ministry wouldntwant you sirius said proudly apparently this one who d want a werewolf auror padfoot even if he was alright at defence brilliant you mean james corrected which made remus smile nah it alright public relations department at gringotts aint too bad i s pose yeah better than wormtail poor guy got stuck running his mother writing supplies shop james said sympathetically seen wormtail then have you corr i aint seen that fool in ages sirius exclaimed sirius you saw him the day we got our results yeah but he went off in a mood cos he only got one acceptable well he only did four newts remus put in trying to be fair yeah spose i d go mad if i got any trolls sirius had received only one mark lower than remus having received four o s two e s remus had managed five o and an e while james had surprised them all receiving 6 o s the girls hadntdone badly either ivana getting all e and one o and diya all a s of course lily had surpassed them all which was pretty amazing considering she did two more subjects than all of them 8 perfect o and a special award for the top five marks in england for charms anyway lads love to stay and chat but goblins can get pretty nasty remus joked as he apparated to work let all do something one of these nights ok james just the marauders no ivana james asked with a raised eyebrow no and no lily either i miss my mates sirius said firmly why padfoot you ve gone soft james joked stuff it jamesie sirius laughed lunging at his friend but missed as he apparated to work sirius grinned and also left diya smiled brightly at the customer who walked into the small boutique in diagon alley she frowned however as the other more eager assistant maxine malkin ran to greet her diya was at her dream job a clothes store however the shop was owned by an old woman who had little creativity and seemed to prefer miss malkin to herself diya rested her chin on her propped up arm and let out a sigh just then the door of the shop opened and rahul patil walked through the door diya couldnthave been happier maxine was busy with the other customer as she greeted her indian friend diya he said with a slightly accented voice and went to hug her hallo rohan looking handsome need any assistance diya asked flirtatiously sensing her old self before remus dumped her returning well miss petrova i incredibly impressed with your work patricia blunt exclaimed as she flipped through ivana portfolio and cv thanks miss photography has always been my favourite part of my artwork and as you can see i adore taking pictures of people ivana said confidently i can indeed when can you start miss blunt editor in chief of witch weekly asked eagerly obviously looking for fresh blood ivana grinned and spoke up happily now if you d like wow i cantbelieve it thank you so much i always thought it was difficult for people just out of school to get employment yes yes well it is but with your talent ivana you could go far anyway splendid we have a celebrity couple getting married and we need some good artistic shots of them dancing to put with the feature article patricia announced leading her to a studio where two famous wizarding singers were waiting although ivana fought the urge to roll her eyes at their mindless conversation she fell happily into her deep love of her work as she began to click lily sat at a desk with a wizard from the department of education she had been placed almost immediately in a front line role when her boss had seen her marks and heard her speak of her passions well no i do not think hogwarts should close despite the many attacks sir albus dumbledore is capable and already keeps his school at top most security the kids are better off there than they are at home but miss eckins would it be wise to trust dumbledore he often has such radical ideas it evans and i would trust dumbledore with my life so for that matter would most people but would it not be wise to transfer the students to durmstrang for a term perhaps just until things quieten down no mr codswallop i do not think that is wise for several reasons one being hogwarts is the best wizarding school especially for students in the uk as they would not have to travel so far second things will not quieten down the ministry and your department must realise this you have a lot of cheek for someone who only just started miss ellen it evans and if you dontmind me saying sir perhaps a lot of cheek is better than being so utterly passive fine let them stay at hogwarts i daresay dumbledore will go mad within the year but apparently that being rather passive the wizard then scraped back his chair and with an angry swish of his robes burst from lily office past a grinning head of department mark bones was a young successful wizard at the ministry and prided himself on agreeing with dumbledore and putting out radical actions well miss evans i daresay you ll be doing brilliantly here he said looking impressed lily blushed crimson but wore a wide smile on her flushed face sirius was snoozing at the back of the room while the lecturer explained about the different tasks involved in auror training james however was paying close attention even making notes if lily had seen him now she would ve been proud wazzat sirius said stupidly awakening with a start james shot him a look and indicated for him to listen sirius leaned back in his chair and tried to listen to the lecture but he was extremely bored it just seemed like school all over again mr you black the auror was saying yeah come here and perform a patronus if you please the handsome man ordered icily folding his arms and shooting sirius an annoyed look james was alarmed sirius was good at defence against the dark arts but sometimes his patronus wasnta corporal full formed one but simply wisps of silver sirius however didntseem in the least worried as he strolled to the front of the class cocking a grin at the unimpressed auror the girls in the room looked excited as they saw two very handsome men standing in front of them two girls seemed to be fighting over whether the auror michael porter was better looking or sirius black for a moment james was reminded of the giggly gryffindor girls chatting in the common room sirius was taking out his wand and twirling it in his fingers drawing sighs from the girls with the exception of alice longbottom who simply cast her worried husband frank an adoring look ok black on three one sirius didntwait and shouted expecto patronum a silvery dog raced from his wand and charged at auror porter running circles around him until it disappeared the class burst into applause james with a sigh of relief good enough for you sir sirius asked sarcastically as the young man glared at him you didntobey orders black i said on three you went on one in the real world you could ve been dead always always an auror must have constant vigilance and listen to everything his superior tells him do you understand me class porter was seething his short blonde hair getting slightly dishevelled yes sir the class replied shocked that sirius had made a mistake and you the auror asked politely yeah yeah sirius said walking back to his seat and slumping in it james cast him a sympathetic glance while porter resumed talking now can anyone else please demonstrate actually obeying orders this time the majority of the class put up their hands and waved them frantically porter called on james who performed the charm perfectly a silver stag bursting from his wand when the auror said three brilliant potter glad to see you re not like your mate james tried to hide a smile when he was praised out of loyalty to sirius but didntquite manage sirius was scowling thank you for visiting gringotts a goblin will take you to your vault now remus said in a pleasant but extremely bored tone he checked the wall clock with a sigh and realised he still had two hours until lunch he sighed but quickly began scratching down some figures with his quill when his nearby boss shot him a warning look um hello i have some money i d like to exchange a nervous looking dark haired woman asked him he was suddenly struck by her beautiful blue eyes which seemed almost purple oh yes remus said shaking himself from the trance the woman seemed to have in her eyes yes my son he got a letter from a school named liam what was it again hogwarts mum yes hogwarts and he needs to buy his supplies but the shops in degon alley diagon alley mum liam interrupted ohh you re a muggle i suppose remus said with a chuckle then felt like smacking himself at his choice of words um yes that what the headmaster told us white beard dumbledore oh yes i ve just graduated from hogwarts yes and we ll exchange your money remus said with a smile the woman looked grateful as she plonked down some pound notes and remus began to exchange them he then carefully explained what each coin was worth whilst stealing glances at her out the corner of his eye yes that sounds amazing mumm can i go with these two to the ice cream place it just around the corner liam interrupted gesturing towards two boys he d obviously made friends with while she d been talking to remus i dontknow love s alrite miss i from a full wizard family ill keep him outta trouble the little boy with red hair and freckles assured her the woman looked rather sceptical but remus put in hurriedly it alright ma am that bill weasley i know the family well he ll keep liam from any trouble and i ll escort you to the ice cream shop myself after we re done here he tried to hide a blush at his eagerness the woman looked in two minds but finally agreed and the boys ran off happily liam clutching a galleon remus had tossed him from the pile sorry i um worry single mothers and all she explained as she gathered up the money as remus retrieved a form for her to sign his heart gave a little jolt single hope you dontmind me asking remus began as he escorted the woman out of gringotts after informing his boss of a five minute break but you look awfully young to be a mum the woman giggled and her purple eyes sparkled had liam when i was fifteen i know i know what you re thinking but i really loved his dad her face fell a little as she said this i wasntthinking anything at all remus said politely which made her smile well yes so one day he just upped and left disappeared literally he was a wizard i found out from the headmaster at hogwarts there was an awkward silence as they came towards the ice cream place so that d make you only about twenty six remus asked cheekily breaking the silence why mr lupin dontask a lady her age but you re only eighteen then arentyou if you ve just graduated she replied laughing yeah but i pretty mature please call me remus i can see that well remus thanks very much i hope to see you soon she added suggestively but i dontknow your name holly ashbery see you remus she provided with a wink and then went to collect her son remus had a broad smile on his face as he returned to his boring job peter awkwardly sat at a stool behind the counter in his mum shop as she went to do some shopping there were no customers but he felt rather jumpy at any slight noise so when the bell above the door tinkled and two people in dark cloaks walked in he almost fell off his stool the man stood back glancing out of the door cautiously whilst the woman approached peter he he hello les lestrange peter stuttered the beautiful woman with dark black hair and familiar grey eyes let out a high pitched laugh the eyes were cold so unlike our other favourite grey eyed member of the black family come now pettigrew i thought we were on better terms than that bellatrix lestrange sneered hello bella rudolphus the man at the door nodded in recognition of peter greeting and how is my dear cousin sirius black he ok he doesntdeserve the name black is what he is and the other blood traitor potter and his mudblood evans was it rudolphus yes bella rudolphus lestrange said in a dignified snotty voice from the doorway um yeah they re all working peter answered nervously bellatrix had an ugly expression on her stunning face but regained her composure to say simply well we shall be in touch peter then she and her husband lifted the hoods of their cloaks and slipped from the store into a nearby dark alleyway peter shivered and hugged himself tightly review the button looks incredibly enticing to me haha authors note im soo sorry for not updating you guys must hate me thank you all

thanks for reviewing and it means sooo much that u think im a good writer ange my most faithful reviewer thank you soo much yep remus and the older woman donteven ask where i came up with that haha sarah no need to feel guilty but it does make me super happy when u do review sirius seems like the impatient type so obviously he not liking auror training as much as he thought and james taking notes just shows how much he wants to be an auror ahha padfootobsessed329 thank youu you re always the first to review and i love them sirius not unpacking and having this crazy mess sounds exactly

ur reviews ok guys here it is sorry it took ages oh and to anyone taking the sat on saturday good luck i know i ll need it for me haha enjoy dumbledore makes contact yeah and then he gets this huge smug look on his face just cos i fluffed up the disguise exercise a tiny little bit i mean i still disguised if i have red hair who cares if i donthave a huge moustache to match sirius fumed before taking a large swig of his fire whisky padfoot just jealous cos he has to share all the female attention with porter prongs i am not i couldntcare less if the girls think that conceited blonde smug bastard is hotter than me resentful much remus asked a conspiratorial grin with james plastered on his face i am not i twice the wizard that guy is yeah in sirius land james muttered why do you want female attention when you have ivana padfoot peter said joining in with the fun and being rewarded with a guffaw of laughter from james who choked on his gillywater i don t want female attention dammit sirius spat angrily folding his arms and leaning back against the booth the marauders were spending a lad night out in the leaky cauldron at the request of sirius but up until now he hadntmanaged to have much fun he d been ridiculed yet again by that damn michael porter and he d hoped the guys would be supportive but they just seemed to find it amusing true it was a little strange him having less girls staring at him and more staring at the teacher but that contrary to his friends beliefs was not what was bothering him it was the fact that this auror seemed to be able to pick apart any of his usually perfect performances with a joke sided with it for some reason auror training simply wasntcoming to him as easily as school had and sirius was beginning to lose his patience it didnthelp that their trainer for two out of the four required tasks was porter and the two absolutely despised one another it also didnthelp that james got along so well with porter come on sirius man he not that bad yeah just cos you have a crush on him remus and peter laughed at sirius pouting face and childish comment while james just rolled his eyes no padfoot i just think he a good teacher and he cool yeah about as cool as severus snape there was a lull of silence as james chose to ignore sirius ratty attitude and the boys all took swigs from their drinks so set a date yet prongs remus asked before james could say anything though sirius smirked playfully and said he hasnteven moved out of his parent house yet moony a wedding date you must be joking james flushed a little and shoved sirius look i just think it makes more sense for now i swear once we get married we ll move out we have been thinking about the wedding though not sure whether to have it really soon or around new years for significance or i seriously dontknow an readers remember this line at the end of the chapter i need your help hmm well whenever you do let us know peter put in james looked at him with a funny expression and replied course i will wormtail you dontthink i wouldntinvite my best mates to my wedding do you yeah you fool how mummy writing shop then pete sirius added with a smile ha ha yes i suppose it alright dead boring sometimes but you know i wouldnthave gotten a better job anywhere else that not true peter remus assured him quite untruthfully well at least you can meet pretty ladies at your job mate i mean remus how many ladies actually even know their way into a bank sirius laughed and james shook his head but inside laughed along with him so sexist padfoot i reckon ivana would love to hear allll about that remus said with a smile beckoning towards the leaky cauldron public owl to pretend to send a message to ivana dontyou dare moony sirius stated pushing remus arm down sharply well she should know her boyfriend a chauvinist pig yeah but anyway the girls dontcome too badly in the bank remus provided rather dreamily he stared into space remembering those hypnotic almost purple eyes of holly ashbery and went silent the other marauders exchanged knowing looks and peter knocked remus on the side of the head anyone there what oh yeah um sorry what were we saying you were telling us all about this mystery bank woman james said slyly nudging sirius who looked absolutely delighted at the chance to poke fun at the more serious marauder uh no no there no such woman well if she can make her way into a bank stop with the chauvinist jokes already padfoot james exclaimed with a chuckle she a really smart single mother beautiful dark hair and violet eyes wow oh and she a muggle remus filled them in a dazed look on his tired face mother james asked alarmed a muggle peter added smart sirius questioned then seeing the incredulous looks on his friends faces he laughed just joking lads so she smart and beautiful man gotcha yourself a keeper there but she a muggle peter piped up in a horrified tone and who are you voldemort sirius retorted with a raised eyebrow peter flinched but quickly said shut it sirius what i mean is it gotta be pretty difficult being with a muggle though i mean we re so different sirius and james rolled their eyes at the quick answer but nodded in acceptance remus sighed and said yeah i suppose you re right peter it does make us fairly different but then my dad was a muggle too he looked a bit more filled with hope until james spoke slowly well that one difference another being she a mum for god sake yeah but she only twenty six older woman nice call sirius exclaimed taking a swig of his drink moony james looked very surprised at his usually sensible friend then not knowing what else to say really the four young men proceeded to drop the subject and instead recount old school stories and drink a little too much and then he took me to paris for the evening and we drank french wine by candle light diya elaborated with a dopey smile on her face ohh rahul sounds lovely so romantic ivana exclaimed as she hugged the green cushion to her stomach with a girlish squeal definitely romantic the most romantic thing james has done for me since school was pulling out my chair for me when we were eating dinner with the family lily pulled a face and ivana laughed diya grinned and said fairly well that is quite gentlemanly for one of our friends anyway he only did it cos his mum walked in as well ivana started giggling at lily face and diya tried with all her might to keep her laughter in but then she too succumbed to the giggles lily laughed along and went on to say and what re they doing now probably getting piss drunk at the leaky cauldron and we re going to have to go and help them apparate home just then there was a tap tapping at the window a beautiful young phoenix hovered in the night sky with a large scroll of paper attached to its foot the girls sat staring at it for two seconds until diya said arentphoenix rare ivana tut tutted in an exasperated tone and rushed to the window to allow fawkes inside di that dumbledore phoenix lily explained after diya looked scandalised at ivana rudeness ohhh ivana threw her a dirty glance and unravelled the note from fawkes leg she then stroked the bird and looked around for a dish of water but it had already spread its colourful plumage and flown back into the dark night ivana went back to the coffee table and moved away the girls mugs making room to spread the letter out james lily sirius remus ivana diya and peter i have taken it forgranted that you were sincere when you voiced your desire to remain in contact with me so i do hope you wontmind the demanding nature of this letter i do not know which one of you fawkes will find but i am in a great dilemma and am of need of your assistance i daresay you all remember my leaving remark when i said i would contact you all on important business with lord voldemort at the height of his power something must be done as of now i am about to embark on a rather dangerous mission for the order of the phoenix i shall however need to speak to you all in person for safety reasons i shall be arriving at the apartment of sirius black at on the morning of september the fifteenth i apologise for the inconvenience but i must return to hogwarts that same morning i hope this letter finds you in time and in good health yours most sincerely albus dumbledore oh gods you do suppose he got out of the mission alright dontyou diya asked worriedly ivana nodded slowly saying well i should hope so he is dumbledore after all the greatest wizard alive lily finished she then scanned the letter once more and gasped turning to look at the clock oh dear it 1 30 and yesterday was the fourteenth which means we re meeting professor dumbledore in half an hour at sirius place ivana said getting up with a jolt well where on earth are the boys diya wondered before the girls apparated quickly to sirius and remus building ohhh yeee meerrryyy hippogriffsssss sirius sung drunkenly grasping at james who was barely standing up properly himself peter clung to his other side with a silly expression on his face and remus was walking in front of them dizzily as they finally reached the top of the staircase sirius tripped over landing flat on his face which started him laughing which promptly made james crack up which provoked remus into clinging to the banister and hold his stomach peter opened his mouth to laugh but instead threw up narrowly missing sirius ewwwwwww sirius exclaimed in a high pitched slur pushing peter away and stumbling his way up humming the infamous christmas carol on the way to his door oi remmy my place is bigger let crash here tonight lily ll kill me if i go home like this sirius i staying here tonight james said decidedly curling up on the large sofa in the middle of his friend flat hic hic hic i need to hic get hic cleaned up padfoot peter said swaying on spot ugh down the hall mate dontyou dare throw up in here sirius said groping at the kitchen counter for some water remus who was a slightly better behaved drunk sat quietly in an armchair and held his aching head oh dude this is gonna hurt you re right there mate this is gonna be a killer tomorrow james slurred burying his head deeper into the cushions no it gonna be a killer right now a voice said from behind him when he opened his eyes and raised his head to identify the girl voice all he saw was a large cushion coming down hard on to his head how dare you be so irrespoinsible james potter lily yelled smacking him harder with the cushion lils lils please james said holding up his hands to protect himself from the many hits he was receiving peter stumbled from the bathroom wiping his mouth and went to sit on a chair but missed and landed with a plop on the floor this was too much for sirius who was already trying to keep his laughter in at james feeble reaction to lily so he burst into uncontrollable laughter diya and lily looked at him with narrowed eyes and folded arms as this prompted james and peter to laugh along with him remus covered his mouth to hide his smile and tried to look at the girls seriously just then ivana walked in with a disgusted expression tracing her tired face ughh which one of you threw up in the hallway and left it for me to clean up ivana accused angrily pocketing her just used wand james and remus pointed at peter who looked at her uncomfortably as she sent him a deathly glare sirius however looked at her as if she was smiling widely he rushed towards her tripping several times on the way and wrapped an arm around her ivana crinkled up her nose looking repulsed and leaned as far as possible away from her boyfriend he was having none of it however as he pulled her closer and looked deep into her eyes you think i beautiful dontyou baby ivana looked at him sarcastically and then looked at remus for explanation james said that all the girls think that auror michael porter is better looking than sirius remus provided dully and massaged his temples with his fingertips diya tsked tsked and went to the kitchen area to conjure up some mugs of coffee for the drunken marauders lily still had her hands on her hips and was staring at james furiously while he tried to give her a sheepish smile unfortunately for him it kept coming out quite scarily and eventually lily removed her glare for fear of laughing in his face so baby i beautiful arenti sirius was saying his face extremely close to ivana s in all his out of control state ivana couldnthelp but think he still was gorgeous his too long messy black hair falling into his face however she started giggling which gradually turned to all out full blown laughter as she looked at sirius confused expression umm hardly she managed to splutter between laughs this made everyone else laugh as well despite the obvious irritation in the room lily even managed a smile as she sat beside a relieved looking james who tried to slink his arm around her she shrugged it off and gave him a threatening look which made him look a little scared and he inched further away from her on the chair sirius was looking quite hurt at ivana comment so she punched his arm lightly and said nah you arentbad love this re instated sirius glee and he began to dance manically around the room yess i kneww it i too sexy for my shirt too sexy for my wand too sexy that it hurtsss what the hell are you singing padfoot remus asked shaking his head oh a muggle song that idiot porter played to get a laugh out the ladies it suits me and prongs a lot more i think though what d ya reckon jamesie sirius inquired pulling his friend up and dancing around the room with him stupidly while the pair of them sang we re too sexyy for our cat too sexyyy shut uppp lily yelled making them stop and let go of each other throw up outside you lot drunk now you re singing that wretched song you are doing my head in what ll dumbledore think dumbledore peter asked gaining an also confused nod from remus yes dumbledore he coming to see us diya said passing out the coffee the boys all sat around the coffee table and read the letter ivana had spread out for them blimey james exhaled wonder what he wants remus thought out loud while peter nodded furiously it obviously important though isntit lily said reasonably as she forced james to take a large gulp of the coffee sirius was very quiet while the others discussed the possibilities of dumbledore visit maybe it cos sirius has a lot of family which might be death eaters ivana suggested she then threw a look at sirius who was getting up and hurriedly trying to straighten up his impossibly messy flat sirius what are you doing cleaning up dumbledore cantsee this place like this sirius said tripping over a pile of magazines in his hurry he then got out his wand and tried to do a quick spell which obviously went wrong since his mind wasntin a brilliant state objects started flying all over the place but sirius had almost no control over any of them just as a particularly large chair flung towards the open door a very tired voice boomed immobilous the objects instantly froze and professor dumbledore stood leaning tiredly against the doorway of sirius flat ivana and lily instantly ran to help him inside as he limped a little and remus got up from his seat to make room for their former headmaster diya fetched a glass of water and james instantly lit a fire in the fireplace peter stood looking rather nervous so the others took this as concern but sirius had a smirk on his face nice one professor always managed to get me out of a tight spot ahh anytime sirius dumbledore chuckled sipping the water diya had given him now now girls there no need to fuss i simply must go to madame pomfrey and she ll fix that cut up instantly ahh poppy sirius said with a dreamy voice which earned him a smack from ivana and another chuckle from dumbledore exactly what are you doing to help sirius ivana asked annoyed followed by enthusiastic nods of agreement from lily and diya comic relief my dear now now please stop fussing dumbledore insisted making the girls back off still with worried looks on their faces what happened professor james asked now very soberly well james i ve just had a run in with an extremely large group of death eaters and unfortunately some dementors dementors they re on our side though arentthey diya exclaimed and dumbledore shook his head sadly the dementors of azkaban are creatures with deep evil rooted within it is only natural for some of them to turn to voldemort the teenagers flinched but sirius hurriedly cut in but professor why were you alone shouldntyou have had back up what about the order james asked this is why i have come to you the order is a dedicated group of individuals but we are not nearly strong enough with such few numbers professor with you as the founder it strong enough lily stated graciously whilst the others nodded in agreement thank you my dear but one old wizard is not nearly a good enough match for over 20 death eaters and voldemort and that is simply the inner circle so what you need is more members remus cried suddenly seeing what dumbledore was hinting at the others audibly gasped as they too registered his idea yes i have come to recruit you all i am completely aware you are a committed group and i have no doubt in my mind you will be a useful addition to my society of course james said immediately which lily echoed as she slipped her shaking hand in his firm but angry one a society against everything the blacks stand for sounds good to me regulus ll love this sirius joked but dumbledore knew this was not his sole reason for joining remus diya and ivana all gave silent nods of consent and peter stood looking very scared well dumbledore asked kindly sirius shot him an angry look and the others looked a little disgusted suddenly peter grabbed his arm and sank into his chair then in a choked voice he said yes sir i only frightened dumbledore slowly got up and limped towards peter placing a hand on his shoulder we all are peter peter looked unconvinced but merely nodded then dumbledore turned to the others well thank you all for this visit the first meeting will be at headquarters in a week or so i shall send details not by post but you shall all be notified he then limped to an open area in the room and before apparating repeated quietly thank you the room was silent as dumbledore left but soon the group began to discuss the meeting the order and most importantly voldemort lily hugged james tightly until he titled her head to look into her eyes and whispered softly to her let set a date a n i need your opinion when shall i have lily and james

after this enjoy thanks once again i really really value your reviews and it means a lot that you take the time to write me one especially those of you who review each and every chapter you re all stars a meeting a sleazebag and a wedding plan a wizard looking remarkably like dumbledore stood whistling casually by an oak tree in the middle of muggle london when a group of seven young people approached him with the same casualness the one with dark messy black hair and grey eyes whispered something to his also black haired friend wearing glasses framing his hazel eyes who had an arm draped over his red headed girlfriend the couple stayed back with the other four youngsters and the handsome teenager approached the dumbledore look a like with caution he leaned against the oak tree and talked to the man out of the corner of his mouth they say you look a lot like a powerful headmaster that d be my brother the old man said staring hard into sirius eyes know of any phoenixes around here sirius asked maintaining the cold eye contact i believe i do all depends on your name that d be sirius black then i suppose you and your friends ought to memorise the information on this piece of paper the man said handing sirius a folded up piece of parchment he then beckoned to the others and once sirius had read the note he passed it to each of the others who nodded in turn until peter returned the paper to the member of the order of the phoenix with a shaky hand there was a moment of silent concentration until suddenly a large house much like james appeared in front of them the man entered first leading them all straight into a large hallway where five coat racks stood only one left without cloaks and robes of all colours draped over it greetings to the headquarters of the order of the phoenix i am aberforth the lesser known dumbledore i apologise for that ridiculous exchange outside sirius but as my brother is the secret keeper only he can tell you where headquarters is no problem sir this is no point in introductions you ll just have to repeat yourself once we enter this room how come sir diya asked nervously well that where the rest of the order and the new members are sitting of course please follow me the seven exchanged looks and followed aberforth into a large room with a huge dining table with at least twenty other witches and wizards chattering away inside they all paused and smiled when they saw the newest members but most went straight back to their conversations some however didn t sirius black emmeline vance said running at him and hugging him tightly sirius grinned and shot a sideways glance at ivana who was just laughing alright em sirius said with a smile she was just about to answer when the better known dumbledore entered the room hurriedly and stood at the head of the long table the room fell silent and everyone scrambled for their seats good afternoon everyone he greeted with a grin before transfiguring his hard chair into a soft comfortable armchair hello albus i trust you re feeling better after the run in with the dementors a pompous looking man said from his place a few seats away from remus yes thank you dedalus our school nurse madame pomfrey fixed that broken leg and cut in a jiff i see recruitment went well caradorc dumbledore smiling around the room at the younger faces yes albus i daresay you ve done quite well as well a skinnier man with wire rimmed glasses and a small moustache said chirpily gesturing towards the marauders and the girls indeed now shall we get down to business the reason we have gathered here for our first official meeting is because of an extremely tragic yet strangely fortunate event as we now have more information on our enemy but i shall let frank and alice tell you about this dumbledore announced taking a seat and motioning for the couple to stand frank and alice longbottom stood shakily from their places across from lily and james and everyone in the room turned their attention to the confident speaking voice of frank alright everyone my name is frank longbottom and this is my wife alice and well the other day we were attacked there were noticeable gasps from all around the room as the group listened intently alice continued in a pleasant yet obviously shock riddled voice not just any attack we were attacked by him who a confused looking man named sturgis podmore asked the skinny bespectacled man caradorc dearborn who looked rather annoyed before whispering you know who ohhh he attacked us after we had left our auror class at the ministry a few weeks ago we turned a bend to apparate in a dark alleyway and there he was with two cronies the lestranges frank continued it was lily turn to gasp as she spoke up during the pause lestrange he attacked sirius and me once when we were in hogsmeade and who are you princess a rough looking man with a bruised eye shot at lily in a suspicious voice lily looked at him a bit surprised james got up half way out of his seat and met the sleazebag of a man look with an even stare of his own dumbledore however held up a hand and james reluctantly sat now now elphias dontbe so rude this is lily evans and her rather protective fianc james potter i suppose to make matters more accessible if you are to speak please introduce yourself first dumbledore suggested in a calm voice with a reassuring glance at lily sorry dumbledore i just reckon people ought not interrupt elphias doge by the way swee art the sleazy looking man lifted his hat and gave lily a horrible toothless grin she wasntinterrupting doge she was just giving her input isntthat what a meeting for james potter by the way james said icily glaring at elphias who smirked back yeah mate dumbledore only just introduced ya oi mate back off sirius said in a warning tone and who re you potter brother elphias replied turning his head suddenly to grin terribly at sirius who merely rolled his eyes sirius sirius black elphias doge eyes got large and he stuttered a bit nervously glancing back at dumbledore quickly b bl black yeah pure blood grey eyes cold heart and all sirius said comically but keeping the warning look fixed on doge who seemed to cower away the people in the room laughed relieved at the ice breaker while ivana squeezed sirius fuming hand under the table to make him feel a little better yes elphias by blood he is a black but by heart by beliefs far from it now i do believe frank and alice have not quite finished alice smiled at lily as if to assure her it was fine she had interrupted and frank began to speak again just before we go on please feel free to add any comments we wontbe offended we promise frank had a slight smile on his face and a little twinkle in his eyes but despite his joking demeanour it was apparent he was still rather phased by the recent attack anyway as we turned the bend the lestranges jumped us and the woman held her wand to my throat while her husband disarmed us bellatrix and rudulphus sirius provided to marlene mckinnon a busty brunette who was jotting down notes yes so when we were disarmed ru rudulphus made a huge mistake in leaving our wands lying nearby and not picking them up you know who was laughing he he cursed frank with the cruciatius everyone in the room winced it didntlast long he was too distracted he saw the group of trainee aurors like ourselves standing in a group you could see the hate in his eyes blood traitors muggle borns he was almost excited at the chance alice started to attend to me because i was shaking from the pain and he he hit her with the same curse the room winced once again as they turned to look at alice he kept laughing laughing but then the woman bellatrix distracted him pointed out you i think sirius alice said looking at sirius unsurely no one saw peter look away quickly sirius just nodded acceptingly haventseen bella in a few years but i not surprised he said uncaringly hang on isntbellatrix lestrange maiden name black a man with scruffy brown hair around the same age as marlene which remus vaguely remembered as benjy fenwick spoke up my cousin sirius explained listlessly the attention of the room was once again on sirius who was merely gazing at the longbottoms willing them to continue an awkward silence ensued look benjy we all know now that sirius comes from a family of dark wizards but just leave it ok he not like them diya put in exasperatedly sirius glanced at her and gave her a small smile of thanks before looking around the room as if to challenge anyone else to question his integrity benjy smiled apologetically and the tension was once again relieved alice please continue professor mcgonnagall spoke up for the first time yes well she seemed to be pointing you out you and james were meeting with peter and remus and well while they were looking i heard the imperius curse come up repeatedly and then well frank i apparated behind voldemort grabbed our wands and managed to grab alice and apparated to the hogs head in hogsmeade frank finished where they met me dumbledore put in a mellow dreamy voice then spoke up from the other end of the table you must be a hell of an apparator to do it so quickly a woman perhaps a year older than them with ash blonde hair and honey coloured eyes interjected frank gave a slight smile at the praise while dumbledore nod confirmed it this narrow escape however gave me a place where i could perhaps locate voldemort or his inner circle so the night i faced those dementors and death eaters i had returned to that alleyway a post outside the ministry elementary we should have thought of it beforehand but i do believe they will have abandoned that post since my visit dumbledore d you reckon we should split these up interr groups for guard duty a extremely ugly man with some grey hair and a glass eye spoke up in a gruff voice no one needed an introduction to the infamous auror alastor mad eye moody yes alastor i believe so age paired with energy please dumbledore stated before falling into a whispered conversation with the three oldest members of the group dedalus diggle minerva mcgonagall and his brother aberforth moody scanned the room his magical eye flipping to the back of his head arite yer lot you the young one with the straggly hair yeah you he said gesturing towards an unsure remus who approached him anxiously you ll be paired with the prewetts there and dearborn yeah and you edgar bones oh and the busty girl taking notes he then stalked over to the next group leaving an open mouthed marlene mckinnon and an apologetic remus ten minutes later james and lily found themselves in a group with the longbottoms their good friend the game keeper at hogwarts rubeus hagrid and much to their disgust elphias doge diya ended up without any of her close friends paired with podmore emmeline vance with whom she held a rather stale relationship benjy fenwick an ex boyfriend of course moody himself and the oldest member diggle sirius much to his delight had mcgonagall as well as peter ivana aberforth and the pale haired dorcas meadows dumbledore of course was the one to report to and so was not placed in a group although we shall not be starting any official work yet i will be asking you to scout the area of expertise you have been assigned to the next meeting will be in a weeks time i shall notify you all of when now however i must get back to the school minerva mcgonagall nodded to her group and followed dumbledore out of the room to head back to hogwarts then slowly in small discreet groups the members of the order of the phoenix left headquarters back to their homes fancy a walk in diagon alley lads sirius suggested as they finally left last oh and what are we chopped liver ivana shot at him a little annoyed at the exclusion oh iv dontbe such a wife when i said lads i meant all of you charming diya muttered as they pressed the stone to lead them into diagon alley lily was holding on to james grasping his arm tightly and muttering to herself she was looking quite pale so james spoke up lily love is something wrong no no i was just thinking of how many more invitations and orders we ll have to make to invite all the order members too oh noo that reminds me i must owl the dress shop they re taking an age and we still haventbooked anywhere for the ceremony oh and what about your robes oh james there so much lily lily calm down james said grabbing her shoulders and shaking her from her frenzy i cantplan this wedding i have all this work and it ohh gods james what ll i do lily said sinking on to a bench while the others snuck away to leave the couple to contemplate the state of their up coming wedding look sweetheart just relax ok we re going to take deep breaths after three alright ready one two three breathe james said squatting in front of her and holding her hand comfortingly lily took a deep breath and the colour started to return to her face as james breathed with her an amused smile playing across his lips thanks james oh when did you become the sensible one you ve rubbed off on me love i sorry it just there so much work to be done at the ministry and with planning the wedding and the order and all the fresh waves of murders i just dontknow if this is the best time for the wedding lily looked very upset as she avoided james glance you dontwant to marry me james asked letting go of her hand and leaning back a little on his haunches no no love it just i dunno with so much stress wouldntit just be better to put it off maybe at new year like we talked about lily seemed unconvinced herself but she finally met james sad eyes lily he began after a giant pause i dontwant to wait with all these attacks it just put things into perspective for me i want to marry you more than you ll ever know i just cantwe please just do it now lily looked as if she was going to cry at james choked up words and she just nodded look i have an idea james started glancing at sirius who was lurking nearby careful not to interrupt their conversation but also be near enough to help if they needed it but let me plan it i promise it ll be as perfect as you always dreamed of and all you need to do is dress your bridesmaids and yourself please lily looked a little worried at the prospect of leaving her entire wedding to her rather unorganised boyfriend and his friends but when she saw the earnest caring look on james face and thought of all the stress she was enduring as of late she smiled in consent james gave a little whoop and kissed her quickly before pulling her up off the seat he then hurried towards sirius and they began to talk quietly meanwhile peter had waved to them all and apparated back to his mum house for dinner so remus joined the boys discussion when james beckoned to him leaving the girls to excitedly discuss lily dress and their robes brilliant prongs the best marauder mischief you ve ever thought of sirius said with a grin remus nodded enthusiastically and agreed she ll love it james when did you become the romantic eh james smiled and looked over his shoulder at lily who looked as if her auburn hair was flicked with gold as a firefly flew over her he then turned to his friends and explained i guess that what happens to a marauder when he in love remus smiled and ruffled james hair with a laugh but sirius was barely paying attention instead he was rambling on about the wedding reception ohhh and my best man speech is going to be wicked you just wait until i tell the story about james and the three girls in one night ohhh or the time remus thought he liked lily and james wanted to kill him oh or the time lily said i was the best looking or hmm maybe i should leave that one

a luxurious wooden garden bench s arite james lily probably jus as nervous hagrid said placing a giant hand on james stiff shoulders oh man lily what if she hates it she wont mate remus comforted it great james peter added brilliant sirius said with a smile which made james choke out a small laugh look dude you re marrying lily for god sake lily you guys are made for each other you ve decided just to have close friends and family so if you do something stupid chances are we ve seen you do something stupider look just take a deep breath everything ll go smooth i promise james looked a lot calmer as he took in sirius words his best mates wouldntlet the wedding get out of hand why should he worry at the back of his head though he knew with sirius there was always some hidden agenda and you guys arentplanning any surprises are you james do you honestly think i d prank you at your own wedding sirius asked with an innocent face yes but i have too much to think about to worry so i off lads see you soon james said before apparating back to his parents house so still hung over sirius remus asked slyly as the remaining four men walked around the secluded garden the location for james and lily extremely intimate wedding unfortunately yes having the bachelor party the night before the wedding wasntthe best plan i suppose sirius said holding his aching head and sitting down on one of the benches you seemed fine when james was here padfoot peter piped up well i didntwant james to think we were doing anything but being good tonight sirius said with a grin as he massaged his temples remus shook his head at this motion trust sirius to be the only one to drink too much but ye arr arentya hagrid asked sirius cautiously hagrid are we ever good on special occasions sirius retorted hagrid laughed and shook his head lads you are ready though arentyou sirius continued turning to his fellow marauders well yes but we just need to check with remus said trailing off and casting a sideways glance at hagrid ohhh noo no yer don t i am nott getting involved hagrid said putting up his hands and backing away from the three marauders oh come on hagrid its barely anything peter said just a teeny tiny little favour mate sirius added there was a moment of silence as hagrid looked from peter nervous eyes to remus negotiating glance to sirius pleading face he let out a sigh of defeat and the other cheered alright wicked now everyone has to go get ready for the wedding i going to swing by the girls place to check on the bride before getting ready and meeting james sirius said strolling towards his flying motorcycle you re not apparating sirius remus asked after waving goodbye to hagrid who had hailed the knight bus well do they have a day bus i cantapparate when i like this hopefully ol mrs potter ll have some pepper up potion later mush sirius said before taking off into the sky on his motorcycle and disappearing using the invisibility button mush remus wondered out loud before straightening a flower and apparating back to his flat oh my god lily said between short sharp desperate breaths lils you need to breathe diya said patting her back comfortingly what was i thinking leaving the wedding to james lily wondered pacing the length of the room wringing her hands you were thinking you were really stressed and needed a break ivana suggested before backing away from the red head fiery look oh god and mrs potter just owled and said he went to check on plans how last minute oh and he was out partying last night oh my god he going to have a hangover at his own wedding i have to do something i have to see him i have to kill him lily ivana and diya both shouted trying to calm her down just then they heard an enormous roar of an engine and there was a huge crash coming from their living room the girls exchanged glances and hurried from ivana bedroom where they were dressing and into the living room sirius was getting off his motorcycle and trying to avoid stepping on all the broken glass in the room as quietly as he could just as he was tiptoeing towards his wand which had flown halfway across the room there was a loud clearing of a throat he winced and turned to see the three girls in their different coloured slips with their arms folded giving him accusatory looks um hiya girls erm those dresses are just gorgeous sirius said flashing his most charming grin lily glanced down and saw that they were all incredibly scantily dressed and blushed crimson before waving her wand so they were dressed in trakkie bottoms and simple t shirts they werentdresses sirius diya explained through clenched teeth as she surveyed the mess in their flat of course it wasntas if she was the tidiest person it just bothered her that she hadntmade the mess sirius black you complete and total git ivana screeched her eyes wide and angry as she glared daggers at her boyfriend um sorry love no worries reparo he said waving his wand and mending the broken glass of the window what is your motorcycle doing here ivana questioning tapping her foot indignantly um i flew it in sirius tried apologetically suddenly lily burst into tears everything going wrong i suppose you ve come to tell me james has run off with some veela haventyou lily wailed utterly serious veela nahh that more my type sirius joked getting a smack from ivana oh lilykins relax you re almost as bad as james with the nerves dry that pretty face now i ve only just come to check how your preparations are going lily sniffled and wiped her face on the handkerchief sirius had offered her o ok what about yours ohh sneakyyy no no i cantsay a word about the wedding just that to quote james it ll be brilliant now if you donthave anything else to ask i ve got to go get ready actually lily started oh james my little boy getting married margaret potter said wiping her tearful eyes and trying to flatten james hair mumm relax come on mum let go james replied trying to duck out of the way of the eldery woman grasp where dad oh at the healer his heart been a bit dodgy lately mrs potter said in a worried tone referring to her husband long standing heart condition dontworry he ll be back

hours mum four hours i not lily i dontneed a millennia to get ready james potter this is your wedding day i know mum i know james said sitting on the bed taking a deep breath mrs potter joined him and placed a comforting arm around his shoulders are you nervous dear no it quite alright to be nervous well in that case yes very james said burying his face into his mother shoulder oh dear i glad i still around to see my only baby get married oh mum stop it you re not that old now now james hurry go shower mrs potter said hiding more tears as she hurriedly left the room when james was left alone he sat staring at the photo of he and lily on his side table and took another deep breath ok here goes potter he whispered to himself before heading to the shower and how about this way lily asked pointing her wand at her newest hairstyle ohhh i love it diya squealed oh that one the one lils ivana agreed gorgeous sirius said listlessly as he slouched in his chair and checked the clock sirius you re not even looking lily accused adamantly with her hands on her hips sirius sighed and shifted in seat before turning to look at her and repeat it gorgeous lily will james like it he ll love it hmm i not sure lily thought out loud turning the mirror and getting out her wand to try a new hairdo just then the doorbell rang i ll get it sirius said jumping at the chance no i need a male opinion lily shouted firmly stopping sirius in his tracks i ll get it diya laughed as he sunk back into his chair gods ivana the only other time i ve spent this long in your bedroom was that night sirius began with a wink sirius ivana warned as lily laughed and then turned to ask their opinion on her new extremely curly hair suddenly there was a crack and remus had apparated into the room padfoot what are you doing james has been owling every ten minutes asking if you re coming yet he explained running a hand through his neatly combed hair well apparently she needed a male opinion looking good lupin ivana commented with a smile remus what do you think of this hair lily asked frantically gesturing to the now slightly bushy curls um it great lils but um ask sirius i going to go get some water remus answered quickly before escaping to the living room lily turned to sirius who sighed and said um i think the one before was better remus chuckled and entered the living room to cross into the kitchen but never quite made it there he stopped in his tracks to stare at diya and rahul patil making out like there was no tomorrow not knowing what to do he tried to turn around and go back into the bedroom but crashed into a large vase which fell over and smashed the snogging couple broke apart and diya started giggling wincing remus muttered a spell to clean up the mess and strode towards rahul outstretched hand and shook it um rahul remus remus rahul um remus is my ex boyfriend i remember from new years nice to meet you remus the indian man said with a grin remus forced a smile on his face but inwardly was turning bright red with anger how did diya always manage to move on faster nice to meet you mate um anyway i actually need to um go so er diya see you at the wedding um yeh bye he said before apparating back to his flat hurriedly once he had arrived he smacked his forehead in disgust what he needed was to meet holly ashbery again that d make him forget about that awkward scene well hopefully he loosened his tie and looked at himself in the mirror he was kind of sweaty so he thought well another shower couldnthurt atleast he could forget about diya and rahul lily there three hours left please i really need to go check on james sirius begged after choosing the perfect eye shadow colour from about 50 different types oh james oh ok go sirius what are you doing here you re the best man not a bridesmaid you think sirius yelled frustrated stomping out of the room to his motorcycle the girls hurried after him sirius black you better not go through that window again ivana warned sorry babe duty calls no time for the door he said grinning as he mounted his motorcycle revved the engine and crashed through the window into the sky sirius the girls yelled at his reducing figure dad where the hell is sirius i going out of my head here james said pacing the room nervously now now son dontworry he ll be here just relax fred potter assured him as he puffed at his pipe dad you ll get smoke all over me please james shouted in an irritated tone oh right sorry son the old man said vanishing the wipe with his wand thanks now if only sirius could get here and make

souls in marriage one where children will spark joy and an even deeper love i think it time i tell you about a little thing called the bird and the bees james stared at his father incredulously dad you cantbe serious son sex is a commitment of course which comes with marriage not only will it dad you re joking right what dad um i know all about sex you do dad i getting married oh well yes then i suppose you do did you have that memory check up james asked concernedly oh yes they did say my memory was rather foggy a loud noise was heard from outside and a few moment later a young man with longish black hair flung himself through the door prongs i so sorry sirius where the hell have you been sorry lily eye shadow hair remus diya and patil sirius said between pants remus diya and patil he walked in on them ouch yeh so how my family man doing dude i feel sick i cantgo through with this shut up prongs what if she realises that she was wrong what if she remembers what a prat i am what if sirius slapped james oww what the hell was that for pull yourself together man ok ok sheesh relax ok prongs so how re your vows going feel ready all practised lily you ready with your vows ivana asked as she curled her eyelashes yes oh gods how come wizard weddings are so much more difficult than muggle ones lily said nervously biting her lip what re muggle weddings like diya questioned curiously oh well almost the same except there usually a priest or if it a different religion some sort of holy man religion priest what well um for example you know how indian wizard weddings are different from english ones oh yeah oh so theyre different for muggles too yeah most of the time and there no actual spell to join the two married souls they do their vows and this um holy man sort of just pronounces them married oh wow that weird how do they know they re actually meant to be then um they dontreally look anyway my vows oh what if james has something amazingly witty and i just this romantic lump james can be pretty romantic lils ivana put in fairly oh gods what if he more romantic than me looking sharp potter sirius commented as james finally emerged from the mirror thanks mate

quickly followed um girls you ready remus said knocking on the door diya and ivana emerged first looking beautiful in matching deep red robes peter and remus both let out low whistles and grinned but

reviewers who i can count on for a review each time all of you are priceless everyone who reads this is priceless everyone who listed me or my story as a favourite or on alert are priceless sirius is priceless well obviously anyway here goes matrimonius psyche a marriage of souls the garden was lit in every possible corner with fiery oil lamps and the chairs which were arranged in a circle had white roses and lilies draped over them giving the whole location a sweet hypnotic fragrance it was an intimate service dumbledore stood with a jovial smile on his face in elaborate violet dress robes chatting to mcgonagall wearing a pale gold dress a rare smile plastered on her face the potters sat on the chairs wearing co ordinated pale blue clothes margaret trying to flatten the sticking up grey hairs on her husband head while he stubbornly tried to escape james was pacing nervously nearby only half listening to the joke sirius was telling a chortling hagrid there was a raised decorated platform where james and lily would exchange their vows it was covered in pink and red rose petals which were charmed to shimmer in the moonlight an extravagant harp was playing by itself in the corner letting out tinkling soothing notes james and the marauders had done a good job when remus and peter hurried in the group started to sit sirius winked at remus who gave him the thumbs up and then he smacked james on the back good luck mate he said with a smile as he shook his friend hand james returned the smile shakily and took a deep breath turning to the entrance a decorated flowered arch which spurted gold shimmering dust at regular intervals stood awaiting the two bridesmaids and lily herself you ready lils ivana said a huge smile on her face no lily replied in a small voice you could always do a runner diya joked no i was kidding ah you guys lily said gripping her friends hands tightly ivana and diya exchanged looks and they wrapped her in a group hug ok let do this baby ivana said breaking the hug and gliding under the arch to be received with ooohs and ahhhs from the people at the service diya grinned at lily and followed to be greeted with similar sounds lily took a deep breath but something stopped her james grinned nervously at the two girls who each greeted him with a kiss on the cheek before rolling their eyes at sirius waggling eyebrows they took seats by remus and peter leaving one vacant for the best man to join them once lily and james were safely on the podium james started to relax when he thought of lily coming out and finally being able to see her he grinned at his parents who waved back while his mother wiped her tearful eyes dumbledore sat looking immensely proud while mcgonagall had a softened motherly expression on her face he was lucky he didntsee the mischievous looks on the marauders faces or his ease would ve disappeared quickly either way however it did disappear lily was nowhere to be seen the group all looked expectantly at the archway but no redhead materialised james started to bite his lip and cast a worried look at sirius who was tugging at his kilt nervously when he noticed james however he smiled and called out lily love you haventdone a runner have you the guests chortled at sirius idiocy but ivana and diya exchanged silent dismay she hadnthad she lily dontbe nervous now if you look half as good as ivana and diya you have nowt to worry about sirius tried again lillian evans james looked confused and then suddenly very hurt and the guests all looked horrified at the prospect of lily leaving james walked slowly off the podium and collapsed into the empty chair waiting for sirius she left me he said in a soft voice before hanging his head and mussing up his for once fairly neat hair shush prongs sirius hissed and cast a pained look at remus who took the hint and instantly placed a comforting arm around james shoulders while asking him quietly to not worry sirius then dashed away towards the arch slowing down and nodding to professor mcgonagall and dumbledore as he passed he then quickened his pace and drew out his wand as he flung himself through the arch way to look for lily what if she had been taken but he had been sure no one could find this place he had been secret keeper he need not have worried however because the minute he emerged from the other side he noticed a redhead sat on a large rock looking absolutely stunning if it hadntbeen for her hair hanging in her face and a defeated expression masking it her mascara and eyeliner had leaked down her face with the hot tears lily sirius asked gently approaching her and looking for any signs of harm oh sirius she said flinging herself into his arms he stroked her back soothingly until he noticed her dress roughly intertwined with a thorny bush he let out a bark like laugh bit stuck are you i tried and i tried but it ripped and then lily wiped her eyes streaking her make up even worse sirius looked at her incredulously are you a witch or are you not oh lily said and quickly disentangled herself oh bloody hell now i ve got myself in this mess scourgify sirius asked after lily was cleaned up sirius squeezed her into a hug and gave her a wink before going back into the clearing and yelling i ll marry you prongs seeing sirius joking again the group realised things must ve sorted out and turned to wait for lily again james smile finally returned and he too watched the entrance for his bride lily took a deep breath as she placed her hands in james sorry about the hold up she whispered as long as you re here now he said gently stroking the side of her face she looked so beautiful he noticed she d picked to wear her hair the same as the night they d first gotten together in loose auburn waves with small white flowers laced in at the top although her eyes were the tiniest bit puffy sirius had managed to clean up her make up well with his spell her eyes were rimmed in black bringing out the startling green which glittered as the light from the oil lamps flickered in them her dress was white with delicate green embroidery tracing them he opened his mouth to begin his vows but something caught in his throat lily stared lovingly at james as he attempted to clear his throat and noted his cutely mussed up hair it had obviously managed to be neat for at least five minutes but signaturely become rumpled his suit robes were stylish black and he d pinned the same small white flower as in her hair to his front she couldntbelieve what he d done with the place it was so perfect it was so magical so romantic it was so james he looked nervous but lily could see the happiness she felt was completely mirrored in her soon to be husband the ceremony would consist of lily and james exchanging vows and then the oldest member of the group would perform the marriage charm in which everyone would partake in james finally able to clear his throat cast the marauders a quick look before beginning lily evans wow i canttell you how incredibly lucky i feel to be the bloke to be standing in front of you here holding your hand and professing my undying devotion to you i remember the first time i ever saw you hair as red as it is now sitting on that stool in the grand hall with the sorting hat hanging way over your head i didntthink much of you then i was more a blonde man at the age of eleven lily laughed as the others chuckled along at james who was grinning now really getting into his speech but once i d dated all the blondes in the school and the brunettes it was about third year at the time more chortling especially loudly from sirius i noticed this gorgeous redhead i plucked up all my courage which wasntdifficult considering what a little arrogant fool i was and asked you out then um well i wish i could forget this next part but you rejected me and every time i asked you about twice a day in third year and once a week until seventh year you kept saying no i began to wonder if i really was that arrogant then when my best mates sirius who by the way is twice as arrogant as me and remus and peter finally got it through my thick skull that i really was an idiot i tried my hardest to change because if i changed i d get the one thing i always wanted and eventually i did lily smiled a tear of happiness trickling down her cheek and i so glad i haventlost you lily i couldntbear the thought you re the only girl that makes my heart feel this way the only girl who can crack me up and keep me in my place at the same time you re the only girl for me evans everyone audibly awwwwwed and lily fought the urge to do the same her knees felt weak the same as they always did when james was romantic so in saying all this i pledge to do whatever it takes to make you happy and take care of you and love you james said turning his gaze shortly to sirius who tossed him a golden wedding band he caught it deftly and slid it on her finger happily lily was smiling from ear to ear as she opened her mouth to speak sirius nudged remus who nudged peter who nudged hagrid who gave a nod before lily could start sirius had rushed out everyone stopped to stare at the crazy man in the kilt who d disappeared in the middle of his best friends wedding james looked positively shocked as he turned to remus who was trying to hide a sheepish grin suddenly a large black dog ran through the service barking happily what was truly astonishing about the picture was the large silver unicorn which galloped gracefully behind it leaving a shimmering trail it traipsed joyfully around the podium sending the petals flying upward and falling softly into lily and james hair and swirling around them despite the annoying interruption james and lily couldntdeny the marauders had probably pulled off the most beautiful prank ever within moments the stir had left when the dog that licked ivana playfully ran out and led the unicorn to its spot outside awaiting the one ride lily and james would take on it before going to their reception sirius lily questioned james with a raised eyebrow but he simply shook his head with laughter a moment later a dishevelled looking sirius swaggered back in winked at the couple sat next to ivana and kissed her other cheek she looked amazed and confused but amused lily laughed and called out alright lads ok if we finish getting married now the guest tittered and remus called out yeah i reckon so if you must peter added with a grin only if you want to love sirius said winking at james yes please lily grinned james potter the first time i saw you was on the train to hogwarts you and sirius were having a go at each other for being blacks and potters and then you both randomly attacked this one other first year sirius laughed loudly while remus and peter chuckled away there were no prizes for knowing lily was talking about snape and even though it brought you guys together i couldnthave thought less of you it didnthelp that both of you were gorgeous and had a swagger to rival any famous quidditch player so of course i ignored you until an incident in third year when you played a prank on me and my friends to be honest i dontknow how i got over the incident in the great hall where u hung us upside down in our skirts but all i can remember is i despised you for it i despised you for all your arrogance and worst of all i despised you for not living up to the potential i knew you had james looked sheepishly to the marauders and nervously back at lily who was smiling but then darn it all james potter you got me it didntmatter how hard i tried to fight it or ignore it it didntmatter how many times i refused dating you i couldntget you out of my head so despite all your arrogance and ridiculousness i fell in love i grew to love the way you messed up your hair when you were nervous like you re doing right now i adored the pranks you and your mates played but the thing i admired the most was your good heart your bravery and those gorgeous hazel eyes a girl could drown in james in such a short while you ve become everything to me my best friend the one i go to when i need to talk the person who ll make me laugh and cry at the same time the love of my life and now i could not possibly imagine anyone else in your place at this beautiful wedding which you organised with our great mates and there nothing more i want than to marry you and start and family with you and love you lily laughed as she choked on the tears now streaming down her face and slid the wedding band on her boyfriend finger james looked choked up but was grinning from ear to ear he winked at her and then stated formally for the purpose of the wedding we ask if the oldest person in the room please give us their blessing and perform the marriage charm so our souls can be united as one lily finished grinning at dumbledore who smiled and stood up with all the luck and happiness in the world matrimonius psyche dumbledore wished raising his wand a pale pink jet shooting from his wand and surrounding lily and james one by one the rest of the guests raised their wands and silver beams joined dumbledore pink one lily and james glowed with the charm for a moment and then all was still they stared at each other smiling widely well kiss for goodness sake sirius shouted before remus clapped his hand over his mouth to silence him james smiled and pulled lily in they shared the same kiss they had the very first time where they felt cartwheels and fireworks the thrill of quidditch the satisfaction of a great relationship and the intensity of love when they broke apart they were greeted with stars from the marauders wands and cheers and clapping from the rest of the elated guests james clasped lily hand tightly to him and after grinning at their friends and family whispered in lily ear well mrs potter you ready for this ready as ever mr potter lily said kissing him softly a moment later a beautiful stork with white and pink feathers dropped a letter from the ministry into james hand mr james potter and mrs lily evans potter we wish to congratulate you on your marriage you have been registered in the ministry greetings cornelius fudge minister for magic that makes it official lads sirius said from behind them as he wrapped them into a hug soon the crowd rushed forward to give their congratulations until sirius yelled alright everyone to the leaky cauldron for the reception we ll be meeting the others there the leaky cauldron sirius lily asked rather horrified slipping her hand into james i know lils i full of surprises sirius and james laughed and lily couldnthelp but grin she felt giddy smile ivana said quickly popping up and snapping a picture of the three laughing she then gestured to the crowd and they quickly apparated away leaving james and lily still holding hands shall we go then lily said getting ready to apparate actually lily james interrupted stopping her i have another way to get there lily looked past his gesturing arm to where the proud silver unicorn stood waiting for them to climb on she gasped and hugged james with a squeal before rushing towards the unicorn to stroke it when they had mounted and placed the sufficient charms on themselves to go unseen they glided off into the air leaving a shimmering trail with the words just married the party was in full swing with the wedding guests the order members and a few old school friends filling the leaky cauldron which sirius had completely booked they were all dancing with lily and james in the centre swaying away completely wrapped up in each other despite the fast tune playing sirius grabbed another glass of champagne supernova and grabbed a fork to clink against it the music was muted and everyone turned to look at the jovial best man as best man i think it is in order for me to tell you all about the two people we re celebrating this evening so take a seat and grab a glass folks sirius said with a grin as everyone chuckled and took a seat ok so originally i had everything all written up all nice like and it just sounded so fake and sick and sickly sweet and so not sirius so i was confused and when i confused i usually go to my good friend remus because he usually very good at sorting out my problems anyway that besides the point he said some rubbish about talking from the heart so i took that to mean make fun of jamesie every chance i got he said with a wink james potter i ll go with the whole wedding vow theme here and say the first time i ever saw you was on the hogwarts express the minute i saw that ridiculous mussed up hair and glasses i recognised you to be a potter someone my parents said i was meant to loathe to hate to treat as the enemy naturally this made me want to be friends as soon as possible but then obviously if you see a black and an extremely handsome one at that approaching you you re not exactly going to open your arms wide and wait for me to hug you now are you so we started to row even then as much as i ll try to deny it i had a ton of respect for the guy i almost looked up to him i think we pretty much sealed the deal when we both wanted to hex the same guy it was inevitable james potter was going to be my best friend and yeah he still is now before i get all mushy and lily like on you lot just joking love sirius said casting lily an amused wink before continuing i honestly dontthink there were two guys who could make as much trouble as we did and imagine that times two yeah the marauders had a laugh at our seven years at hogwarts whether it was turning people hair green flirting with the ladies or just messing about people considered james the ring leader but they didntknow us they didntknow that james didntgive a toss about which one of us was the most popular most rich most clever or anything james is kinda like that he the one guy who wontcare if he heard you talking about him as long as you could give him a way to make things better there have only been 3 times james has really gotten mad one time was when i did something stupid which deserved his anger one time when peter bumped into him and made him lose the snitch he d stolen and this time remus ol boy thought he d fallen for our lily remus slapped his forehead and covered his eyes with his hands as the listening crowd laughed heartily lily grinned and james forced a chuckle it still felt weird thinking about it i remember it like it was yesterday remus comes back from a study session with evans and sits on my bed and i like moony why are you on my bed and he like i think i like lily and i like that still doesntmean you re allowed on my bed so i kicked him off and once i d kicked him off i kicked him really hard a marauder basic rule is not to fall for another girl problem was i knew at that point remus probably had a better chance with james girl than james actually did anyway as much as i begged remus to keep this to himself of course guilt consumed our little perfectionist and he went straight to james to tell him and you guys could probably guess how our calm collected reasonable james reacted yeh he punched him out i would ve laughed but he looked ready to kill so me and pete had to restrain him of course they didnttalk for like a week until remus realised he liked marilee and lily was just good at helping him out i think it was then when we all knew the james and lily saga was going to be a part of fate even if she didntknow it yet james and lily shared a silent knowing look at this comment because sirius didntrealise he d practically quoted them from only a few months earlier after kissing softly they returned their attention to sirius who was grinning at them wildly anyway james has practically been the brother i always wanted and the potters and my friends have been the family i wished i d had so i mean in general i guess i didntmind that he was almost as funny and good looking and charming as me alright i suppose he just as funny but then he goes and falls for lily and his brain goes to mush he ready to hurt one of his best friend over her well not properly but you know anyway yeah so when lily finally gave him a chance you could tell they were perfect for each other right from the start i mean i ll be honest lils i didntthink much of you until late last year but now wow dude i mean i can see why james fell so in love it hard to find people like lily she got this smile that lights up the room this gorgeous face a killer body and a heart to match seriously how prongs got her i ll never know it not only that she a perfect match for our potter cos she hilarious and kind and knows just how to put him in his place having said all these brilliant things about you lils dontyou dare think for a second i letting you monopolise all of james time james mate you ve gotta come round at least once a day i not sure i could take it without your snoring on my sofa but all jokes aside james you ve not only been a brilliant surrogate brother but also the best friend i ve ever had the best friend i ever will have no one can make me laugh like you and i dontwanna sound like a pathetic girl or anything but dude i gonna miss you you ve been everything to me but lily i cantthink of any girl better for our james than you you ve got this personality which just compliments his in a way i doubt anyone else could you guys are perfect for each other and lils babe i dunno how you did it but you finally deflated that big head my friend got anyway i want everyone to raise their glasses to lily and james the best friend i ve ever had and a girl who could not be more perfect for him to the bride and groom lily and james sirius said dramatically lifting

ve stayed with my parents a bit longer james said adding another heavy box next to the many on the floor of the flat oh dontworry about it you guys need your own place more than i do besides padfoot and i are practically always in each others houses anyway remus tried to appear casual rather than admitting to his friends he hadntquite managed to make rent gringott had lowered all wages in his department he hadnteven told sirius he figured using lily and james need for their own place was a good excuse anyway i better get to work i ll wake up sirius james but you ll probably need to check on him again before you go to auror training remus said before waving to lily and crossing the hall to his now shared apartment he banged on sirius door loudly before entering and clicking his tongue at his friend who was still enveloped in his sheets remus approached silently and paused to look at sirius who had a silly smile on his face as he hugged his pillow and drooled a little then with a yank he pulled the sheets off sirius who immediately woke and cried out wake up sunshine remus exclaimed with a laugh while sirius squinted at him and tried to glare get to work roommate remus added before apparating to gringott with a pop sirius propped himself up on his elbows and tried to shake the sleep off him then eyeing the duvet which was just out of his reach he glanced at the clock and lunged at the covers to pull over him for a quick snooze alright love so i ll finish unpacking if you bring the dinner tonight lily said pushing her dishevelled hair off her face as james straightened his work robes and grabbed two bagels off the counter yeah cool you sure you re allowed to take the day off he asked concernedly yeah i have a lot of sick days now hurry you ll be late you have to wake up sirius as well lily said shooing her husband out with a quick peck on the cheek hey is that all i get james said with a pout standing defiantly in the doorway lily sighed but giggled as james pulled her in for a proper kiss before he winked and rushed across the hall to wake up his mate sirius black get your arse the hell out of bed will ya james yelled tugging at the blanket which sirius was trying desperately to hold onto finally james let go and sirius was flung backwards and hit the headboard his friend laughed and repeated get out of bed porter will have a cow if you re late he then apparated away after tossing the extra bagel at sirius who looked at the clock and groaned he rolled off the bed and landed on the floor with a thump damn auror training he said to himself as he ducked into the bathroom to quickly wash his face and brush his teeth before leaving later that day ivana lay on james and lily bed watching her friend unpack her clothes lils why not use magic magic wont get us everywhere iv lily said vaguely as she closed the door of the wardrobe au contraire magic will get you everywhere ivana grinned cheekily and lily stopped and looked at her what re you talking about petrova well potttter haha you should ve seen what rahul did for diya the other night he did this amazing firework show just outside the flat just for their anniversary needless to say it got him places eww ivana you re so vulgar lily laughed as she tossed james sweater at her friend mr lupin that the fifth time i ve caught you staring at the clock if you are so utterly bored with this job i will let you go a furious yet extremely short wizard yelped at remus who tried his best not to yawn these were obviously open threats because the department was shorthanded as it was oh and don t think im joking lupin you know you re lucky i gave you this job remus boss warned this gave remus a bit of a fright because he knew it was hard for a werewolf to be employed and pitchard had kindly overseen it sorry sir he sighed trying to sound apologetic mr pitchard harrumphed and skittled away to leave remus to attend to his approaching customer his heart lifted instantly when he saw the purple eyes and dark hair hallo remus holly ashbery said with a cautious smile miss ashbery remus greeted happily longing to call her name oh stop with the formalities it holly anyway i ve come to exchange some more money to send liam she explained dumping a pile of bills on the table forgotten our exchange rate already holly he chuckled holly visibly blushed i afraid i not good at this wizard stuff she said shyly oh dontworry you ll soon find a way to get the hang of it remus assured her touching her hand as he pushed the pile of galleons towards her she looked at his hand and smiled silkily well do you think you could be the way maybe we could go to lunch and you could help me remus eyes opened wide as he was about to nod enthusiastically suddenly however he remembered the conversation he d only just had with his boss um i want to but i dontknow he started holly looked upset but nodded and started to turn away it s not as if i dontwant to holly it just i have to stay here remus put in hurriedly i could wait she cooed turning and smiling seductively as remus gazed at her beautiful face there seemed to be something stopping him was he ready to start another proper relationship just then he heard a cough and a giggle as he saw two people waiting to be served he glanced at holly who made it clear she wasntmoving until he d made his decision because she d propped herself against the desk and was eyeing him up and down after loosening the button around his neck he turned to the people waiting and took a double take diya he said nervously at the beautiful woman who was whispering in a delighted rahul ear oh remus she realised instantly detaching herself from rahul and gulping er is there anyone else i the only one here remus replied coolly oh hello remus nice to see you again rahul smiled pleasantly suddenly remus wanted nothing other than to rip his mouth off for smiling so nicely do you think you could process this bill for us we ve gotten a refund he was saying we buying stuff together now are we remus spoke icily as he snatched the bill off the table remus diya put in sharply rahul looked rather surprised at his cool demeanour but just squeezed diya hand well yes actually now if you could please just rahul said keeping a level voice but not taking his eyes off remus underneath the table remus clenched his fist but tweaked his mouth into a pained smile right away sir he said before finally breaking the staring match and glancing down at the receipt wait a wedding hall remus questioned looking at diya who wasntlooking at him but her cheeks were turning a warm pink arentyou meant to just do your job rahul asked annoyed at remus uncharacteristically mean behaviour just give us the money remus diya whispered not looking at him he looked torn as he glanced from rahul to diya and back finally he sighed and dumped a bag of gold in front of rahul thank you remus rahul said before holding diya hand and steering her away she glanced over her shoulder with an unreadable look before she kissed patil cheek and turned around remus stood shell shocked at the events that had just occurred diya getting married suddenly he noticed holly with her chin propped on her elbow looking at him with an encouraging smile suddenly he tossed his gringotts tie at the nearby goblin saying oi kariki cover for me will ya i takin an early lunch with that he flung his legs over the desk and grabbed a delighted holly hand to take her out apparently sirius black wasntthe only rebel brilliant james porter said delighted at the multiple disarming charm james had produced disarming half the room james grinned and shook the auror hand before returning to his place where a bored sirius just blinked in his direction ahh so who next ah you ve been rather quiet all day please come to the front porter face had turned from a genuine smiling one to a rather sadistic look he grinned at sirius in a way quite unlike he had with james rather than fond it was quite close to loathing sirius didntlook pleased either as he sauntered to the front and lazily stretched immeadietly porter shouted expelliarmus locomotor mortis sirius wand flew from his hand and his body suddenly became as rigid as a board as he collapsed to the floor the class laughed at sirius getting caught off guard as his eyes the only part of his body which could still move darted around furiously always be prepared black porter said toughly a slight smile on his face finite incanteum sirius angrily got to his feet and snatched his wand from porter offered hand he huffed angrily and blew the lock of hair off his face to glare icily with a look of determination at the auror now as always has demonstrated the complete wrong thing to do always be stupefy this time however sirius was ready for him and shouted protego blocking the hex with a purple shield well done black for once but try avoiding this porter then started to shout a number of curses and hexes one after another sirius managed to block the first one with his shield charm but then took to dodging each bolt he soon began to laugh as none of the twenty curses porter threw at him even grazed him he was dodging them rather quickly and laughing as the auror face became increasingly angry and disbelieving aww come on porter mate you can do better than that sirius yelled a smug expression on his face as he dodged a stunning charm expelliarmus porter wand flew out of his hand and sirius caught it deftly and twirled it in his fingers with a toothy grin the class erupted into appreciative applause and james wolf whistled however their awe was shortly interrupted as the infuriated auror yelled quiet black if you think some fancy footwork and running will save your ass in the real world you re completely wrong well it was enough to avoid you though wasntit sirius replied coolly and james knew instantly he d gone too far practically fuming at the ears the auror seemed to be restraining all his sense of self to avoid throwing an extremely unforgivable curse at sirius and if not that punch him smack on the nose sirius noticed this look which only made him grin wider something wrong divide in to pairs practise duelling and shielding porter managed to choke out before noticing a man standing at the doorway as the class divided into pairs and james reluctantly gave sirius a high five porter approached his boss the head of magical law enforcement barty crouch the pair looked at the group and spoke in whispered conversation both longbottoms are great and potter he brilliant what about his mate black is it porter face was grim as much as i despise the fellow he clever but he far too up his own ass pardon the expression sir to do really well too reckless too cheeky and his charms arentnearly as good as he thinks he obviously doesntgive a toss or he d be practising sounds like his family then crouch said slowly porter inside knew sirius would never be a dark wizard but his hatred for him blinded his vision very much so i afraid far too reckless on top of all of that doubt he has one caring bone in his body pfftt well of course the blacks have a reputation for being cold well deal as well as you can perhaps if he does pass he may come of use crouch muttered before turning to leave michael porter was not a cruel man however he did have a lot of pride he would not admit to it of course but in this respect he was probably far worse than even sirius which is perhaps why he gave this false information of course sirius black cared about something it may not have been his studies but he most certainly cared for his best friend james potter even michael porter could see this in telling barty crouch however that sirius may have been capable of dark magic he didntknow what circumstances it would bring about a few years from that point well well i see james has caught you off guard or were you not concentrating again he yelled as loud as possible sirius meanwhile stuck a finger in his ear and winced sheesh man there no need to shout porter let out a roar of rage and angrily threw some powerful hexes at sirius who shielded them just in time look now i getting kind of tired of you picking on me old man sirius started getting rather angry and forgetting that the auror at most was probably only three or four years older maybe if you actually won a duel to my satisfaction i would stop oh porter why would i ever want to satisfy you levicorpus sirius chanted almost lazily and his teacher immediately hung upside down from the ankle the class fought the urge to laugh out loud as this curse had been extremely popular during their days at school but porter looked absolutely outraged and almost scared seeing this look james shoved sirius who laughed and muttered the counter curse how that sir he asked a smile playing on his lips how dare you dark magic in my classroom dark magic sirius countered incredulously have you not noticed that the followers of you know who use precisely the same trick porter was yelling his face completely red no actually it just a harmles hex for godsake sirius shouted back irritated the room was silent with awkwardness probably every one in that room had used the same curse more than once and now sirius was being accused of using dark magic more like you re family than i thought black porter spat viciously sirius eyes grew wide and then became disbelieving as he scoffed out a laugh fine he yelled crossing the room to grab his bag near his desk the room was still as they watched him just where do you think you re going there still twenty minutes of my lesson i done i finished with this fucking auror training if i end up like you i might have to murder myself instead of voldemort now excuse me get the hell out of my way sirius demanded staring stonily at the incredulous auror who chuckled and stepped aside padfoot james tried but porter was still chuckling always knew you were a failure he shot after sirius who despite his boiling temper coolly kept his head turned forward as he walked out of the department with all the dignity he could muster a n how about that eh review pleasee author note first of all i wanna apologize for taking an ageee to update i ve been super busy and also suddenly got caught up in my other fic but dontworry this is still my baby haha and i cantwait to finish it and see what you guys thought of it as a whole this chapter has jumped quite a few weeks ahead because if i kept going at the pace i was going at before this fic would

non verbal was i wrong another wedding and more attacks babe guess what came in the mail james said strolling into the kitchen holding the daily prophet and a stack of letters that had come with the morning owl post what that lily said as she tried to push her hair off her eyes but instead streaked a large trail of flour along her cheek look at you you re such a mess james teased wiping her cheek and tucking her hair behind her ears for her lily smiled as he planted a kiss on the top of her head and sat on a stool across the counter to face her he dropped a letter and photo in front of her so she could read it without touching anything instantly she let out a squeal ohhh he adorable trust wood and cassie to come up with such a looker lily said pointing at the baby who was only a few months old sitting on cassie lap in the picture james laughed as he saw little oliver was clutching a mini broom as his parents looked on proudly didnti tell you our kids would be playing quidditch together how d you know our kids will like quidditch it in the genes baby suddenly sirius appeared behind lily who gave a startled cry and almost dropped the bowl of icing sirius smoothly grabbed it however and placed it on the table honestly lils you could ve wasted a perfectly good bowl of sweetness he said sticking his finger in and scooping up some icing lily instantly rapped on his fingers with her wand oi that the icing for diya wedding cake watch it will ya who woulda thought diya would settle down and marry the same people who thought you d quit auror training oh wait that was everyone lily said sarcastically james shot her a look but sirius just laughed ohh lils you re still hung up on that it been weeks he drawled as he lazily leaned against the counter well padfoot have you considered finding a new job or are you just rushing everywhere on that motorcycle of yours the latter prongsie the latter what does ivana think about this then lily piped up lils unlike you two me and ivana are not married she doesntgive a toss lily muttered something incomprehensible under her breath which sirius decided to ignore where is ivana by the way james asked oh she said something about seeing diya he answered dismissively how it going with you two normal sirius said before plopping onto the couch and stretching out lily looked at him wearing a rather annoyed expression what did you even do anything for her birthday last week course i did lils i took her for a ride and we sat and watched the stars all romantic like sirius you really should pay more attention to her you know ivana is this amazing woman i sometimes dontthink you realise she could get up and walk away unless u start showing you care oh lily you and your relationship advice look i know ivana amazing but she just busy with her photography and i busyy with random rebellious rampages james provided well i was going for sustaining my coolness but that works better and to think i thought james was the arrogant one lily said shaking her head as if on cue ivana appeared at the door with peter in tow look who i found he seemed to have forgotten the way here ivana said tiredly as she walked to sirius and slid an arm around his waist as he threw an arm over her shoulders casually but with a pointed look at lily peter a n lol bet u guys thought i forgot him who was looking rather thinner than normal smiled at them and said um i dontknow what came over me ahh petey you were always rubbish at remembering things sirius remarked with a lopsided grin which made ivana poke him in the ribs among other things james added with a smirk lily smacked him over the head with a spoon and he winced before smiling apologetically at peter you re invited to the wedding then wormtail sirius asked apparently not noticing the resentful look peter was shooting at james and himself yeah my mum shop supplied all the invitations so diya invited me peter explained oh crap ivana swore what that means remus is the only one not to be invited lily said uncomfortably they all looked weirdly at each other as they heard remus laugh from the flat across the hall this was then followed by a girlish laugh and they instantly knew holly was over well i spose at least he got that muggle said james has he even told her yet i reckon he will soon it getting serious sirius inferred a moment later remus stood outside in the hall waving goodbye to holly and walked through the door to be met with awkward expressions oh so where we going then he asked noticing their formal attire um lily began well you see remus ivana continued gently we re going to diya wedding mate the remaining three marauders blurted out a look of annoyance flickered across remus handsome face for a moment before he shrugged and muttered well have fun before turning out and closing the door of he and sirius flat behind him oh diya babe it was such a gorgeous ceremony lily said happily as she squeezed her friend hands diya was dressed in a bright red and gold sari having just gone through a cultural indian wizard wedding her friends had all been amazed at the beautiful ceremony and were now saying their goodbyes to diya and rahul who were heading off to india for their honeymoon seriously di you were such a beautiful bride wow i cantbelieve my two best friends are married ivana exclaimed incredulously oh iv you know sirius ll pop the question any day now at least he loves you not like me and remus diya said suddenly feeling a rush of anger towards her exboyfriend and love towards her husband to be honest i doubt it but we ll see ivana answered with a small smile before hugging her friend tightly lily followed and then the girls approached rahul to wish him the best of luck and to take care of their friend before they returned sirius james and peter had heartily congratulated rahul because as much as they wished otherwise he was a rather nice bloke they were however slightly guarded with their friendliness out of loyalty to their fellow marauder after each of the boys had crushed diya in a hug the married couple waved to the enormous crowd of guests and disappeared in their carriage to their honeymoon destination on the way home peter seemed rather unexplainably jumpy rather than apparating they had decided to walk to their building considering the fresh night air pete mate it late you can stay on the couch tonight if you want sirius offered as they walked lily noted that ivana looked rather upset at this but sirius didntseem to have noticed as he slung his usual arm around her rather limp shoulders peter however declined saying quickly oh no man i dontwant to be any trouble besides i have a meeting tomorrow morning meeting what meeting james asked curiously yeah the order meeting in the evening isntit ivana asked with alarm peter eyes diverted and he stuffed his hands in his pockets rather shiftily sirius immediately noticed for someone who barely picked up on his girlfriend moods he could certainly pick out suspicious behaviour wormtail he pressed look i didntwant you guys to know but i ve been seeing this girl lily and ivana let out a thrilled squeak finally happy that peter had found someone rather than being the usual tag along james looked surprised but then smiled genuinely happy for his friend he even shoved sirius roughly when he saw the signature smirk which was obviously ready to tease to great lengths when do we meet this mystery woman pete um she shy it might be quite a while anyway must go he blurted out and quickly waved before disapparating pete finally gets some woah never thought the day would come sirius remarked oh leave him be sirius alright pretty lily hey pretty ivana want me to take you home ivana face fell disappointed sirius hadntasked her to stay over not that he didntwant her there he was just looking forward to spending a night out on his bike lily glared at him but james didntreally seem to notice um alright yes please ivana said softly she then swiftly hugged lily before composing herself and grinning at james before slipping her hand into sirius as they took a turn to the nearby area in london where diya and ivana lived however now ivana lived there alone when they were out of earshot lily poked james why is he such an oblivious prat what ivana her first night alone in that flat and he doesnteven invite her to stay round he even invited peter for goodness sake ohhh crap well i doubt he meant anything by it he probably just wants to go driving tonight so driving is more important than his girlfriend who loves him does she love him of course doesnthe umm i dontknow he never however got to finish his sentence because a tall hooded wizard accompanied with two henchmen had appeared in front of them the wizard voice was high pitched and cold with a rather ghostly quality and they recognized him instantly to be the dark lord voldemort the two death eaters beside him avery and nott cackled as voldemort surveyed them ah two good wizards well well isnttoday my lucky day lily stay back james said standing in front of her her face was grim as she obliged drawing her wand well voldemort it seems your not quite as lucky as you think the order of the phoenix ring any bells voldemort pursed his unhuman lips as his cold hollow eyes stared at james face phoenix schoenix he said comically before lazily muttering crucio which made james thrive desperately on the floor he let out a cackling laugh motioning to his death eaters to step back i ll have fun killing off you young foolish ones stay back lily said approaching him bravely and brandishing her wand oh step aside girl i have no interest in killing a useless mudblood who too afraid to protect her own boyfriend stupefy she yelled voldemort almost rolled his eyes as he wordlessly produced a shield which the spell bounced off ohh clever girl braver than i suspected immobilous james croaked from his position on the floor which again was quickly dispelled by the powerful wizard you do realise that dumbledore will be here within seconds dontyou all members of his society are to inform him of their departure and arrival times he ll know if something has gone wrong lily said as she knelt beside james rubbing his back a trace of alarm washed over the wizard face before he laughed i have no time for these games i have a rather important meeting to attend to voldemort said sneering at them and shooting another quick cruciatius spell at lily this time avery nott finish them he ordered before disappearing in a flash but lily and james were far too quick for the bumbling death eaters she stunned one instantly before being hit momentarily james managed to intervene quickly enough and stunned the other death eater before they hurried away to their flat after performing safety spells they rushed to remus with the news sirius was humming as he stood facing ivana at her door so goodnight see you tomorrow at the order meeting yeah goodnight ivana said sadly fumbling with the door handle oh i ran into dorcas the other day yeah ivana whispered narrowing her eyes a little at the rather beautiful witch that sirius rather worshipped yeah she such a smart witch no wonder she was in ravenclaw she was telling me all about her plan for our next scout that great well goodnight love sirius said thinking ivana was simply too tired to carry a conversation he wrapped an arm around her waist and drew her close making her gasp he then stared deeply into her shimmering blue eyes and kissed her tenderly soon the kiss became more passionate as he slipped his tongue in gently and she clung to the front of his shirt the kiss was then broken by sirius who smirked at her and headed to leave she instantly felt all her doubt wash away with that kiss and smiled before turning to go inside however when she did she saw lily head in the fireplace she quickly ran to sirius who came back and they both knelt in front of the fire to hear of lily and james attack sirius sat with ivana stunned at the news their best friends had been attacked while they were snogging it seemed almost unreal ivana was shaking as sirius hugged her tightly to comfort her she slowly fell asleep and he contemplated staying with her then thinking of his motorcycle he carried ivana to her bed and kissed her tenderly on the head with a whispered see you tomorrow ivana she murmured in her sleep and he apparated to the flat the events with lily and james had him all muddled he didntthink he could just sleep or even sit still at all that night he needed to get out and think and his motorcycle was just the thing to help him a n review it babyy author note sorry it taken a bloody age seriously guys the work has just been piling up i wanna thank everyone who reviewed i not allowed to write thanks separately so i will reply directly to the next reviewers enjoy it pam big news all around it was early january by the time diya and rahul returned from their honeymoon aside from bringing exotic gifts for all of them they bore news which practically turned the group upside down with shock i pregnant diya said after taking a huge breath and gathering all her friends in the room only remus and peter were missing as rahul clutched her hand excitedly what ivana asked amazed pregnant james and sirius said together with glee she could possibly be carrying a boy someone they could teach to play quidditch lily remained discreetly quiet throughout this but no one really noticed diya was grinning and rahul had a hand on her tummy honestly i surprised you guys didntnotice me losing my figure two months along and none of you even noticed diya said with a tsk tsk well i did wonder if you d let yourself go ivana said jokingly before hugging her friend tightly lily approached next but kept silent as she hugged diya james noticed and worried that lily was upset that it wasnther carrying a baby they had been trying unfortunately to no avail james couldntthink of anything better than holding a little baby in his arms a product of he and lily love they d try again sooo tell us about the honeymoon di ivana said curling up on lily sofa with a cup of tea the next afternoon lily too sat eager for the undoubtably romantic account of diya and rahul trip to india oh it was so beautiful we travelled in the mountains in goa and rode on elephants and then every night we you know diya said turning red with excitement and embarrassment lily and ivana exchanged cheeky looks no we dontknow why dontyou tell us lily put in i ve really never been so happy and it never been so wonderful before not even with remus diya said a smile playing at her lips wow it so great you guys have moved on and stayed friends and everything ivana enthused well i wouldntcall awkward silences and angry glares friends but you know whatever we were never really friends before we were together i guess it understandable we dontget along how is he great actually him and that muggle holly really get along lily said rather disappointedly why the funny face lils diya asked oh you know there nothing she can really do about it ivana joked earning her a sarcastic lily look no i just think theres something funny about her i mean she alright but it like remus really loves her and i m not so sure she feels the same ivana finished what a cow diya said indignantly well i dontknow maybe she alright her little boy liam is such a sweetheart lily said fairly always the diplomat eh lils no i reckon she just obsessed with marriage well she not really going to get very far with remus then diya said with a mixture of a frown and a smirk ivana and lily exchanged another doubtful look and ivana said well maybe we ll see diya opened her eyes wide in surprise exactly how much did i miss she so beautiful she so beautiful remus sang to himself as he messed with his straggly hair in the mirror a white strand suddenly caught his attention and he sighed damn being a werewolf holly wouldntwant to be with someone who was greying so very pre maturely sighing he took out a scissors and went to cut it off but jumped and cut a chunk out when sirius sneaked up behind him and clapped him on the back nice one remmy i dontreckon the weird sisters ll let you join but good enough singing for my taste remus threw him a cold look why are you sneaking up on people padfoot oh you know nothing to do get a job get a flat touch so what the beautiful muggle waiting for you to do tonight then sirius asked with a perverted wink well i was thinking i might tell her but you re afraid she ll run away screaming nice well actually yes dude if she doesntaccept you for who you are she no worth it she deserves better remus said sadly cutting another chunk out of his hair oi mate enough with the edward scissor hands bit what i dunno lily made me watch some muggle pilm the other day film and that cool yeah muggles are the a bit fetch eh fetch yeah mush mush yeah so anyway just go and tell her and um try taking a shower you smell like trees it cologne padfoot it yuck is what it is anyway i off off where oh nothing and the like you know that motorcycle is going to get you killed one day live fast die young james bean dean and seriously if you re going to watch muggle films at least get the names right bye bye moony old chap sirius said flitting out of the door in what he thought to be a dignified way peter peter peter for the fifty hundredth time my auror test is not for a month but you re taking it early as well yeah james answered rather proudly porter had been so pleased with his last demonstration he had suggested james take the auror test early so how your bird then pete james said absent mindedly doodling with the quill on peter desk onto a piece of parchment for sale james that for the customers oh sorry wormtail here james said dumping a galleon on the counter if it had been remus or sirius they probably wouldnthave accepted the money but peter readily took it and put it in the safe of his mother shop anyway my bird is alright um she got pretty angry at me the other day for not telling her something he said nervously trailing off and not meeting james eyes james being the friend he was decided not to push the subject the bell above the door tinkled merrily as an auror james recognised from the ministry entered he looked grave as he approached james hello hello james to what do we owe this pleasure handwriting supplies james said smiling charmingly peter the apparent salesman just looked lost unfortunately i come with terrible news your father james what about him he died of heart failure this afternoon i terribly sorry son james stood stone cold still taking in the news his father dead peter looked uncomfortably at his friend and placed a hand on his shoulder which james nudged off he he what he died of i heard you james cried as he stormed from the shop and apparated as soon as fast as he could to his parent house at godric hollow he rushed in and noted his father briefcase standing as always near the doorway his coat hung up it couldntbe true the house seemed eerily silent and james rushed around calling for his mother he finally hurtled through the door of his parent bedroom where a group of healers were levitating a stretcher with a body covered fully in a white sheet james stood stunned in the doorway as they passed a lump gathering in his throat as they left the room he noticed his mother curled up in the armchair in the corner sobbing her heart out james swallowed hard trying to rid his throat of the large lump he walked slowly to his mother and hugged her hard i didntthink i didntthink it would be so soon margaret wailed clinging to james and speaking through sobs he just came in clutching his chest and as he collapsed he a tear trickled down james grieved face as he swallowed again and prompted his mother to continue he said he loved us and then he just his eyes they just sshhh sshh ma it ll be ok will it i all alone james my husband she choked before erupting into fresh uncontrollable sobs and burying her face into her son chest as he held her tightly and rubbed her back my dad he thought sadly sirius was in a local pub listening to the wireless commentary on the latest chudley cannon puddlemere united match cheering with the rest of the customers while the cannons were favourite team sirius and james had always much preferred puddlemere especially now that cassie was on the team suddenly the commentary was interrupted by a news bulletin and everyone jeered annoyed at the interruption sirius sipped his butterbeer and listened impatiently to the breaking news hours ago renowned auror fred potter died of heart failure in his home at godric hollow he was 62 he will be sorely missed sirius choked on his drink at the sound of his almost adoptive father death he couldntbe hurriedly dumping some change on the bar he rushed out and headed to his home of the last few years of his school life james mrs potter we re in here sirius lily voice called sadly he not he cantbe sirius yelled his voice strained as he entered the bedroom he knew at once however that it was true seeing the look on margaret and james faces oh mama sirius said hugging her and trying desperately to push the shakiness from his voice the four of them sat in silence margaret letting out the occasional sob for several minutes finally james spoke we re moving back ma you re not going to be alone in this she merely nodded as lily agreed and kissed her tear stained cheek james then stood up and strode from the room sirius squeezed mrs potter again tightly and hurried after him leaving lily to console her prongs sirius said cautiously seeing his friend back as he looked out of the window when he reached him he saw james shoulders were shaking with silent grief and he hugged him not saying a word the two friends then sat not saying a word each thinking of an anecdote of their loving hilarious and kind father the funeral was a large event many wizards and witches coming to pay their respects to a very well liked old auror afterwards remus and sirius returned to their flat and sat in the kitchen thinking poor james remus said we all saw it coming i guess just a bit of a shock are you alright i dunno he was the only real father i ever had you know yeah he in a better place i guess of course anyway look i need to think about something else well james and lils moved out you going to move back or what well it not that i mind you here dude i just figured you d want your own space sirius i cantpay the rent what why well they sorta cut our salary and well i cantreally afford my own place remus said quietly sirius nodded it alright dude you could ve just told us i know i guess i just ashamed we re

paying attention to her i dunno i dontreally have the head for it remus nodded but said nothing sirius did seem to spend an unusual amount of time with his motorcycle or at pubs rather than ivana but after he had been so understanding of remus predicament he didntwant to give any lectures sometimes i wonder if i cut out for this relationship stuff dontwe all still didnttell her eh yeah and i haventtold her about the job either i just think she d look at me different girls eh remus laughed yeah anyway dude i going to sleep alright man thanks anytime moony sirius said with a smile before

severus will be applying for a post at hogwarts soon we ll soon get rid of the lot yes master keep an eye on that black his brother regulus loyalty is wavering yes master very well now leave me peter turned to leave when the voice spoke again well done pettigrew these so called friends are not worth your worry voldemort said laughing menacingly again although peter nodded inside he was suddenly very scared james father death would be the least of their problems if the dark lord decided to single them out a n damn rat review please a n this chapter has massive time jumps because i feel like the story is taking way too long hope it doesntbother anyone it keeps the action more consistent rather than having millions of chapters with nothing going on sorry for the wait ive just been so busy with uni applications enjoy it i will try and update asap cos i ve written this really eventful chapter which will prob be about 38 or 39 and i need to finish all the chaps in between i know i write really weird hahaha alright take care pam because dorcas said so james yawned and rolled on to his side feeling a scratch on his stomach a few weeks later lily was looking at him eyes wide open with a slight smile on her face james smiled back sleepily and said morning love mmm al alright he asked through a stretch brilliant well that always good what up sweetheart james i late james propped himself up on to his elbows and looked at her confused lils babe it saturday no work remember lily giggled and smacked his forearm no silly i late late james looked at her still confused with a gasp of exasperation lily said pregnant you dolt james looked shocked for a moment and a slow smile slid onto his face you are well i cantbe sure but three weeks late seems pretty definite james let out a whoop and threw the covers off himself and stood on the bed and did a jig you re pregnant you re pregnant we re having a babyyy he then pulled her up with him and danced her around on the bed wildly lily laughed happily and hugged james who squeezed her so hard she said ouch instantly james looked worried and cupped her face with both hands are you ok baby he then looked down and placed two hands on her stomach and levelled his head with her mid section are youu ok baby he asked concernedly lily laughed at his concern and pulled him up to face her her face in a huge grin course we are we have the best daddy and husband ever james grinned and kissed her so passionately they fell over back into the pillows chuckling as they lay surrounded in sheets and pillows lily red hair sprawled over the white material james propped himself over her and looked into her eyes i love you lily we re going to have a family dad would be so proud lily touched the side of his face and said softly he is proud james james looked at her for a moment and tilted her face up before kissing her tenderly and sweetly one month later anyone attacked sirius asked as ivana flipped through the daily prophet well they ve reported the second longbottom attack ivana said quietly answering him she scanned the article and suddenly let out a yelp it says alice is four weeks pregnant cor is everyone pregnant then sirius said a smarmy look on his face looking over at diya whose belly was extremely big and james and lily who had their fingers entwined lily smiled and nuzzled closer to her husband whereas diya let out a cutting remark shut up sirius cutting he answered sarcastically suddenly diya dissolved into tears and the group looked at her very strangely indeed remus who was sitting rather awkwardly beside her since both their significant others werentpresent placed a hand on her shoulder alright diya but she simply sobbed what wrong with her peter asked frantically as the others just stared i was only joking diya sirius said rather alarmed it just mood swings sirius ivana said quietly what he asked rudely what do you mean what i just explained ivana said her voice tense and slightly raised how the hell do you expect me to hear you if you re whispering he asked angrily diya wailed louder at the sound of them fighting but they didntseem to notice lily approached diya and hugged her as she cried she sent james a pleading look to get sirius to stop his onslaught but james looked just as lost as everyone else look i dontget what the hell you re problem with me is lately ivana but you re always on my back on your back on your back sirius black i have done nothing but speak to you calmly for weeks on end and you still treat me like dirt well did you ever think that maybe i was stressed everyone always telling me to do something with my life did it ever occur to you ivana that i dontcare that i donthave a job he said standing up yelling at her oh what you re standing up now you re trying to intimidate me sirius me i so sick of this i dontknow what i supposed to have done but all i know is you love that bloody motorbike more than you even talk to me now ivana said also getting up well at least that bloody motorbike doesntgive me shit for having fun you are impossible ivana said angrily almost hissing at him talk to me whenever you re over whatever the hell you re going through she then stormed out of the room and locked herself in the bathroom leaving the room in silence except for the sobs coming from diya sirius looked rather stunned as he sunk back into his chair staring after his girlfriend nice one mate james said angrily before rushing to the bathroom and tapping softly on the door inside he heard muffled sobs and the sound of ivana trying to calm herself down what just happened we never fight sirius said listlessly well maybe cos you started acting like a prick remus said coldly sirius why did you even start yelling at her lily asked a little too calmly sirius put his head in his hands and shook his head i donteven know ivana i apparating in james said quietly to the door before disappearing with a crack when he arrived in the bathroom ivana was sitting on the tiled floor eyes rather red but looking extremely blank iv he questioned sitting next to her on the floor james we fight for the most ridiculous reasons i donteven understand it he does love you he just being weird that just the thing i dontthink he does love me ivana well sure he does as much as he loves a friend but not the way i love him james sat silently not knowing what to say it was such a stupid fight i better just go apologize ivana said getting up and pulling james up after her he looked confused but said nothing they walked out of the bathroom and ivana headed directly to sirius who looked extremely upset he opened his mouth to say something but she just kissed him when they parted she simply said sorry me too he replied hugging her diya who had finally stopped crying looked at them incredulously that was random ivana shrugged and sirius smiled as the others laughed now is anyone going to explain why diya was crying peter piped up diya took a deep breath well as you all know rahul has been doing a lot of work in bradford lately so he was offered a position there that great congrats james said excitedly but lily nudged him you ll be ok diya dontworry the commute will hardly even bother you the others nodded in agreement but diya was quiet i going with him what ivana burst out we re a family we cantbe separated even before the baby is born but then we ll never see you lily said sure you will i can apparate in all the time diya said nervously no sirius yelled which surprised everyone no you re not allowed to leave none of us can he said desperately come on sirius it ll be ok no i hate this everyone just going off and doing their own thing and leaving their friends behind he said before storming out and flying off on his motorcycle diya looked troubled and the others uncomfortable it was true sirius seemed to be the only one still living in their hogwarts days what about the order peter asked the others turned interested in this dire question i ll be remaining a member but ill be a spy in bradford i ve already talked to professor dumbledore speaking of i better go finish developing my photographs before the order meeting later see you guys love you di she said hugging her friend who wouldntbe attending any more official order meetings yeah we have an appointment with the healer lily and james said also standing up i ll go find sirius peter said unexpectedly that left diya with remus um i ve gotta see holly bye diya remus said extremely uncomfortably before apparating like the others well mrs potter you re certainly looking well your pregnancy seems to be going fine the healer said as he vanished a projection of the inside of lily uterus coming from his wand certainly better than your dear mother in law such a terrible thing he said muttering which james overheard what about my mother he said sharply oh dear she hasnttold you the healer said uncomfortably straightening his spectacles what hasntshe told me james said stepping forward threateningly james lily said tugging him back what are you talking about healer parker well dear margaret she has a very advanced case of dragon pox what she told me she was just feeling tired james shouted thinking of how his mother had been in bed an awful lot well i do suppose she could ve used a concealment charm i terribly sorry to blurt this out and also i have another patient the healer said ushering them out james had a maddened look on his face as he grabbed lily arm and headed outside to the apparating lot mum james shouted walking swiftly upstairs with lily running to catch up mum oh god mum he said walking in on his mother trying to hurriedly hide her pox marks mum why didntyou tell me you ve been so upset about your father i just i couldn t mum james said sadly taking her hand oh mrs potter how much how much lily said her voice breaking how much longer about ten months of suffering my dear margaret croaked from her bed lily gulped and sat down i can however if you let me james end it sooner what james asked loudly i have a certificate from healer parker which will allow me to oh mum dontdo this to me james you know i couldntgo on much longer without my freddy james nodded staring at her so let me she said drawing out her wand lily gasped and covered her mouth james looked from his wife to his mother and silently nodded giving his consent i love you mum he said his voice tight as a tear rolled down his cheek i love you son and you lily take care of your baby tell him his grandparents love him margaret said smiling and placing the wand to her head james squeezed his eyes shut as his mother performed the charm and then turned and hugged a shocked lily another two months later at order of the phoenix meeting on a lighter note i have just been informed our spy in bradford mrs diya patil has gone into labour an hour ago dumbledore said a smile on his experienced face the order smiled at the good news and then set to work on their newest research i hate not being able to see diya during this time lily huffed as she ran a hand over her slightly large stomach we ll go and see her in bradford as soon as the meetings over love james said soothingly before turning to talk icily with elphias doge the rather sleazy man none of them particularly liked and that how i managed to kill off those death eaters dorcas said in her quiet mature but confident voice wow sirius said in awe that amazing dorcas anyone could ve done it she said blushing slightly no you re just so smart cor if i d have known there were people like you at school when i was there sirius smiled with a wink which made dorcas giggle rather uncharacteristically ivana who sat nearby plotting a map with peter and professor mcgonagall let her jaw drop in surprise was that supposed to mean that if he had known dorcas he wouldnthave wanted to be with her oh sirius i do think your hair getting a bit silly dorcas said running her fingers through it ivana was irritated with the touching but smirked to herself knowing sirius would be quite offended he loved his hair long really do you think i ought to get it cut sirius asked her ivana couldnttake it anymore sirius i love it long she said sitting beside him and touching his arm sirius barely noticed her and just smiled and sort of nudged her hand away ivana was disappointed but she hadntparticularly expected much more she and sirius had barely kissed lately well not that its bad dorcas said carefully but i do think your duelling might benefit from your hair not hanging in your face wow if you say so dorcass iv will you cut it for me sirius said turning to her ivana stared at him incredulously um no she said flatly before walking off sirius looked at her confused before shrugging and turning back to dorcas i do hope she wasntinsulted who ivana nahhh so dorcas will you cut it of course sirius she said getting her wand out oh diya twins they re beautiful lily exclaimed as she kissed her friend who was lying in a hospital bed holding her two twins ahh i knew they d be lookers james said with a smile also kissing their friend and then shaking rahul hand oh i so happy thanks for coming guys are the others coming diya said happily kissing her two girls heads well yeah ivana and sirius should be on their way pete couldntmake it and remus well remus is seeing holly i think diya laughed easily obviously suddenly they all heard voices at the door it looks ridiculous sirius ivana was saying look i told you i like it besides dorcas says dorcas dorcas dorcas who cares it isntyou at all oh ivana give it a rest i think it looks great it bloody short and preppy is what it is mind your language there are babies around ivana then made an incomprehensible noise as the bickering couple entered she immeadiely calmed herself down and ran to diya quickly to look at the babies damn girls sirius said laughing no quidditch then james oi who said girls cant play quidditch lily asked do any of you girls james said cheekily dorcas does sirius put it randomly oh of course she does ivana said icily before excusing herself to the bathroom what her problem sirius asked everyone looked at him incredulously but said nothing so sirius great haircut diya remarked oh thanks dorcas cut it for me you know she hang on what re you lot laughing at no one answered as they simply stared at sirius whose hair was so short it looked as if it had been attacked obviously ivana had been right a n i ll try and write another chapter before my birthday on

you all think it a bit depressing when you see near to 400 hits but only 6 reviews thanks again to padfootobsessed329 for reading hope you all enjoy this chapter pam xx a lake full of feelings the year was passing quite slowly and the seventh years were relishing their last year at hogwarts with the weather still fairly warm even in mid october they lounged under trees by the lake pretending to be studying but just enjoying the sunshine and calm breeze that billowed through the school grounds keeping everyone mood rather calm and relaxed lily sat with ivana and diya under a large beech tree and tried to test them for the upcoming charms quiz lily it ivana birthday she shouldnthave to be subject to complete torture not to mention it sunday diya said groaning as lily questioned her friends on the cheering charm ivana laughed and lay down on the grass as her friends bickered diya dontuse ivana birthday as an excuse for youu not to learn she knows it it was from our owl year for goodness sake lily argued ivana closed her eyes and took in the warm breeze just then she felt a tug on her ankle she opening her eyes quickly and saw that all four marauders had grabbed both her arms and legs struggling in horror she screamed you guys better not sirius laughed or you ll do what james joined his laughter saying iv we thought you deserved a nice treat for your birthday ivana wriggled around as they lifted her clear off the floor and replied oh what being carried off in possibly the most uncomfortable position known to man let me down lily diya help the two girls stood up and were now shaking with laughter and shook their heads helplessly remus grinned slyly and said well its so warm out today ivana we thought you could use cooling off sirius and james laughed conspiratorially at this and they began swinging the bewildered girl as they ran forward each holding an arm a crowd had gathered and were now smiling and chuckling at the marauder hyper behaviour peter who looked a little confused at remus last comment stopped for a moment and asked questioningly but i thought we were just throwing her in the lake ivana eyes widened into round saucers no way you wouldn t she exclaimed staring in horror at the boys ah that where you re wrong ivana m dear we most certainly would james said smugly as remus grinned like a madman they lowered her to her feet at the edge of the water and cornered her smiling as they moved forward have a nice swim ivvy sirius laughed as he stretched out a hand to push her strangely ivana grinned cheekily oh you too siri she said as she pulled him in after her spluttering shocked as he came to the top sirius stared at ivana who had surfaced spluttering equally as much then he laughed good naturedly before erupting into hysterics at the sight of ivana wet blonde hair which was covered with seaweed he then proceeded to dunk her and got her in a headlock and ruffled her soaking hair james remus and peter were now on the ground laughing at sirius who was now being pushed under by ivana diya and lily had tears in their eyes from uncontrollable giggles finally they gave in and grabbed ivana outstretched hand and helped her out of the lake sirius stayed in treading water and yelled out to james oi prongs mate come in the water fine james folded his arms and stood defiantly on the bank of the water padfoot if you think i getting in that freezing water you ve got another thing he however couldntfinish his sentence because lily had pushed him headfirst into the freezing cold water after sirius he emerged in an outrage remus you prat if that was you he stopped as he saw lily cheekily eyeing him in his wet robes lily he asked incredulously she laughed in answer and looked over at sirius who was practically choking with laughter their eyes met and sirius looked a bit uncomfortable as he stopped she tried to give him a weak grin but he just looked down james was now pulling himself from the water and running at her screeching she ran away from him as he pulled her into a wet hug look evans now i ve got you all wet you deserved that didntyou no james eww you re soaking let me go james potter you unhand me this minute alas fair maiden i cannot you may betray me again james replied holding on to her tightly keeping up the medieval lingo i wont i wont now let me go lily said between squirms james reluctantly let her go and grinned as she pushed him and strolled over to ivana pulling her along to head up to the castle to change sirius who had finally clambered out of the water peeled off his drenched shirt and shot a satisfied smirk at james before yelling after them oh and petrova happy birthday ivana rolled her eyes at him but when she turned around her blush was a bright crimson lily sat drying her wet hair in the gryffindor common room fifteen minutes later waiting for ivana to finish showering she smiled remembering how james had grabbed her soaking her shirt and hair and she laughed to herself just then two large hands covered her eyes and a low voice said guess who squealing she turned and hugged david before kissing him soundly on the lips where have you been i missed you lily said suddenly forgetting all about the scene at the lake oh well james asked me to train the new gryffindor keeper so i ve sorta been helping her out the past few days she getting really good but i ve missed you too wood said pulling her in for another kiss hmph why couldntpotter help her i mean you d think the captain a chaser would be better to train a keeper than the team beater lily pouted david looked surprised but a little pleased i thought you two were getting along he asked curiously oh no we are he actually a lot of fun but i hate our free time together being sacrificed wood beamed happily great so you ll go to the halloween dance with me then lily swatted him on the arm of course silly she answered contently before leaning in for yet another kiss just then a very wet shirtless james potter trampled into the common room followed by an also shirtless sirius who was laughing animatedly at remus who looked rather disgruntled as he wore soaking wet robes diya held onto his arm and was trying in vain to not laugh with sirius peter was no where in sight the laughter stopped abruptly as they saw the two head students kissing furiously james face fell visibly and sirius glanced worriedly at his friend diya looked sheepish as remus cast her a fleeting confused look separating david and lily looked at the four gryffindors apparently oblivious to the obvious surprise on their faces sirius patted james reassuringly on the shoulder and nodded at the couple as he strolled up the staircase to change james i was looking for you training with cassie went brilliantly today she can stop almost everything david said excitedly to his captain james was staring at lily who was blushing and trying to conceal her swollen lips with her hand he now turned and said stiffly that great wood thanks i can probably take it from there i ve been overlooking extra practices with the new chasers so i didntreally have time i hope you werentresentful or anything i know i could ve asked sirius or kingston but with sirius always in detention and kingston being in a runt with his seeking you seemed the logical choice though still feeling thorough irritation with his team mate james was fair and all business when it came to quidditch he didntwant wood to think he d been trying to distract him from lily in fact he d almost forgot they were together recently ever since he and lily had started getting along but he now realised they were still very much together james smiled at wood and nodded at lily and then stormed up the staircase to brood remus looked at diya expectantly with a raised eyebrow and after greeting the heads they went off to a corner of the common room well what was that you didnttell me they were still together i could ve warned james remus whispered angrily remus you re her friend too i thought you would ve known besides it not like james would ve stopped flirting with her anyway diya argued back well he would ve still liked to know if the girl he macking on has a boyfriend even if the girl is lily he ll be feeling like a complete idiot now di diya looked at the boy staircase guiltily oh well lily likes james a lot as a friend now you know but she quite taken with wood i just dontthink he has a chance anymore remus looked sad but agreed i guess i ll have to talk to him diya eyes surveyed him concernedly and they kissed softly before he sighed and got up to follow james james sat in a chair in the boy dormitory silently thinking david and lily lily and david it just didntsound right not as right as james and lily anyway or lily and james oh what was wrong with him who cared what the names sounded like together lily didntlike him all the feelings he d felt in the past month had been his imagination no he couldntfeel something coming from her if there wasntanything could he his mangled confused thoughts were interrupted by sirius shaking his wet black hair out like a dog as he tried to towel dry it he was wearing new dry clothes and he took a seat on the bed opposite james chair remus had also just entered the room performing a heating charm on his robes and then proceeded to do the same to the trousers james was wearing she really doesntlike me does she james said to no one in particular sure she does prongs sirius tried half heartedly remus sighed she does prongs just not in that way she has david now doesntshe he told his friend rather apologetically james said nothing his thoughtful eyes looked as if they would bear a hole through peter poster of marvin miggs the mad muggle sirius began apprehensively look mate but i felt something guys you cantjust imagine feelings from someone maybe she didntmean to but she likes me i know it james interrupted remus shook his head and looked at his friend hopelessly i really sorry james but you know there are tons of other girls no i want lily she all i want guys dontyou get it i haventcared about a girl like this ever she does like me come on james maybe y know you should just let this one go plenty of other ladies to love man i cant let this one go padfoot i cant well not without knowing for sure she doesntfeel the same i need to know james said insolently staring at his best friends desperately remus nodded and sirius shrugged and the room fell into awkward silence where the hell is petey by the way sirius asked looking around david thoroughly exhausted pecked lily on the cheek before retreating to his room for an early night it was around nine and the gryffindors were lazing around the common room talking playing exploding snap wizard chess or finishing off last minute homework for the next day of classes sirius had returned moments earlier with butterbeers and sweets from honeydukes and had given them to ivana and some others as a small celebration for her birthday then wanting to avoid detention he sat down to quickly scribble down a few feet of parchment for the herbology essay due tomorrow ivana sat drinking butterbeer and played exploding snap with marcus forsynthe giggling while he flirted with her remus and diya were wrapped closely together in the corner away from the crowd james sat doodling on a spare piece of parchment pretending to work hard on his transfiguration when in actual fact he d finished it ages before instead he had been watching lily and david out of the corner of his eye seething he d found rather than tracing the usual letters l e he was crossing out every d and w he found in the transfiguration textbook sighing he muttered an incantation to get rid of the scribbles it was now or never hey lily he said approaching her with a friendly voice um you feel like a walk i sorta have something important to tell you glancing at the clock lily frowned i dunno james it almost 9 30 we re not really meant to please you re head girl you can bend the rules a little it really important he cut in hurriedly lily reluctantly smiled at the seriousness on james usually light hearted face alright as long as it quick she said getting up as the pair walked out of the portrait hole sirius sighed poor jamesie was in for heartache and he didnteven realise this was like the time petey hang on where the hell was petey sirius looked around a little suspiciously but realised he had too much work to care at the moment james where are we going cantwe at least stay in the castle lily asked nervously looking around for teachers no no let go by the lake no one will be there lily shrugged confusedly but followed james past the dungeons where they saw peter appearing looking rather shiftily behind him he jumped as he saw them and stuttered wha what what re you doing here pr prongs james frowned at the way peter had winced when saying his nickname i could ask you the same pete i needed to talk to lily what your excuse peter looked scared and checked behind him before stammering um well i i um i was taking remedial potions yeh remedial potions he couldntlook at either of them in the eye james looked as though he was about to crack up but lily nudged him that alright peter it nothing to be ashamed of but you are still out of your common room very late i afraid i ll need to take five points for that she said kindly but firmly peter looked frightened but nodded at the pair and rushed off to the gryffindor common room a few minutes later james had pulled lily under the same beech tree but that afternoon he stood biting his lip slightly not saying anything but looking at her nervously lily smiled so james what is it that you couldnttell me in the bright warm security of the castle james gulped he took a deep breath and said quickly lily i ve been feeling it even more so since we ve become friends and i just i needed to know if you felt the same then without waiting for a reply from her taken aback face he wrapped his arm around her waist and drew her close then pausing a second to stare into her beautiful eyes he kissed her gently but passionately lily was completely surprised they were friends oh but then why did she feel this way as he kissed her her knees were weak and the passion in the kiss was enough to melt her heart he moved his lips softly but the firmness of the kiss made her feel safe she started to kiss him back she couldntstop herself she let down her guard and sank deeper into the embrace as she ran her fingers through his messy black hair the kiss was fiery but mild and her heart fluttered in a way she d never felt before so unlike her kisses with david david her boyfriend oh shit lily pulled back from james and gasped her hand flying over her mouth james mouth upturned into a slight smile as he stared at her wow there were no words to describe the moment that had just passed he d never felt fireworks and cartwheels the thrill of quidditch and the softness of love all at the same time simply from kissing one girl he knew in that moment lily evans was the one but she was screaming at him now james how why i with wood she shrieked and then smacked him across the face before running back to the castle james sank to the floor befuddled he touched his cheek and felt the warmth of her slap his fingers moved to his lips which were still tingling how had he been so wrong she didntcare about him at all she was with wood she d made that crystal clear it really was over no matter how in love he was with lily evans she didntfeel the same way probably even despised him now but something was nagging at the back of james mind if she so clearly didntlike him then why did she kiss him back a n please review just a couple of lines authors note hey all thanks for the reading as always anyway just to clear up i decided to not make james head boy to steer clear of the usual plotline though admittedly the rest is sorta clich in all honesty i had completely forgotten hagrid told harry in the first book that both his parents were head students i think i was sorta thrown off by sirius in the 5th book saying he spent too much time in detention with james sorry for the mistake but i still think it makes things kinda interesting with james using different methods to prove he all grown up to lily i was vaguely thinking about making some random twist to change the head boy situation let me know if you think this is a good idea or its fine imagining it the way it is with wood as head boy note that if i do make the twist it ll be a little bit further down the line not a crazy change that makes wood an evil villain who gets expelled or something but the only way the decision will be easy for me is if you guys let me know so please review and tell me your opinion smiles sweetly pam xx for the record a lottt of things happen in this chapter hence the length and after that tediously long author note on with the story please read the above by the way a balmy ball the halloween ball was in full swing as the feast came to an end it was a rare occasion at hogwarts to have a dance because for the majority of holidays part of the school was always away with family the dance floor was cluttered with couples as celestina warbeck sang a slow song with a husky voice she was the newest smash hit singer in the wizarding world and although she often sang upbeat music it was no secret her true calling was her ballads which put everyone in the mood for romance sirius shoulders slumped as emmeline wrapped her arms around his neck tightly he looked around uncomfortably feeling girls glaring at him over their partners shoulders emmeline sighed as she rested her head on his own shoulder and unknown to sirius sent a huge smirk around the grand hall at the glowering girls sirius wasnthaving a terrible time emmeline was pleasant enough not annoying in the least however she lacked one thing in sirius opinion the ability to make good conversation ordinarily it wasntdifficult for sirius to strike up small talk with anyone however talking to emmeline reminded him of talking to a steel pole not wanting to be impolite however sirius had desperately spent the last hour trying to get his date to talk about anything other than all the girls who d nearly cursed her into oblivion when they found out who was taking her to the dance after trying in vain to steer the conversation onto her rather than him sirius gave up and asked her to dance they hadntstopped since but this was the first slow song being played and he was beginning to get bored just swaying slowly taking a good look around the grand hall he observed diya and remus kissing in a dark corner which sparked a cheeky grin from sirius as he shook his head laughingly at the inseparable at the mouth couple his eyes then wandered with amusement to james sitting on a chair nervously tapping his foot and absent mindedly keeping his focus on the girl with auburn hair who was dancing with wood a few metres away his date sat beside him resting her chin on a propped up arm occasionally blowing up so her purposely messy light brown fringe shifted from over her eyes she glanced at james once or twice but looked extremely bored she shared this feeling with her friend who was sitting next to her looking openly disgusted at peter as he ignored her due to being in deep conversation with narcissa black sirius frowned at this he knew his fair haired cousin was attractive despite the disgusted expression she held permanently in her features but she was a nasty piece of work and peter knew it under the influence of her older sister bellatrix narcissa loathed sirius and his muggle loving ways bellatrix the oldest of three girls was already married to another ex slytherin rudolphus lestrange and had proceeded to introduce her youngest sister to an older lucius malfoy to whom she was now engaged he was sure bella her husband and malfoy were in league with a powerful dark wizard if the sullen conversations at the black dinner table had told him anything his family was definetly not a picnic other than andromeda who like him had been burned from the family tree she now lived in a remote part of london with her muggle born husband ted tonks and their daughter nymphadora he didntsee them much however he did owl his favourite cousin from time to time feeling eyes on him peter looked up and saw sirius glaring at him looking terrified momentarily he gave sirius a helpless look sirius couldntbe sure but he thought he had seen peter discreetly whisper something to narcissa however her lips had curled into a smile and she got up and before shooting sirius a hateful look raised her wand at peter though he felt in his gut something wasntquite right sirius pulled away from his dance partner and hurtled towards his cousin wand raised james had also snapped out of his daze and turned to protect peter the pale headed black stopped and snickered at the two gryffindors who had approached her remus was now walking quickly towards the scene however before he reached them narcissa turned to leave with regulus after saying spitefully ah always the gallant heroes these gryffindors good evening pettigrew then with a swish of silver robes sirius cousin had swished off with his brother to the far end of the grand hall to join a group of howling slytherins remus sighed and nodded towards his friends before returning to diya james irritated stuffed his wand back into his robes and glared after the slytherins muttering cowards before checking if peter was ok sirius however was red with fury his anger was not directed solely towards the slytherins much to onlookers surprise what were you talking to her about wormtail he asked threateningly n nothing sirius peter stuttered eyes wide with fright the on looking slytherins had now quietened down their laughter to smug grins as they watched sirius stare at peter angrily i d hardly call what seemed to be a deep conversation nothing pettigrew sirius growled through clenched teeth peter tried to direct a frantic helpless look at james who was looking at sirius puzzled this went unnoticed however as james loyally allowed his best friend to interrogate peter by staying silent throughout the exchange i i she was threatening me sirius i i didntwant to get you lot involved because i wanted to help myself for once i suppose that didntgo very well peter reflected quietly looking down at his feet james softened as he had often felt pity for their tag along friend wormtail he patted peter on the back reassuringly and told him s alrite petey mate what re friends for eh then he threw sirius a meaningful look to indicate him to let it go looking sceptical sirius still seething nodded curtly at james and both boys missed the shudder peter had displayed when james had patted him i think i ll go to bed not feeling too well peter decided breaking away from james and bidding his friends and date a good night yeah good idea pete watch your back alright sirius replied as his way of apologising james and sirius watched in silence as peter retreated through the huge doors of the grand hall good job playing prefect there prongs sirius you were acting ridiculous pete is too pathetic to hurt a fly not to mention get in league with a bunch of slytherins if moony wasntaround to make you feel bad someone needed to play the responsible card here james shot back slightly offended yeh yeh there something different about wormtail lately though james i cantput my finger on it he been acting well shifty lately sirius countered ignoring the slight edge to his friend voice if there was one thing about his friendship with james he was sure of it was that they could disagree without falling out james slapped his forehead and laughed remedial potions padfoot he been taking remedial potions he ashamed i mean who wouldntbe look we ve known pete long enough to know he wouldntgo screw us over so dontact like such an over suspicious dad sirius sirius let out a bark of laughter despite pretending to be annoyed remedial potions what a troll honestly then after punching james playfully in the arm he reluctantly allowed himself to be towed off by emmeline to get something to drink james grinned and turned to steph who was tugging at the sleeve of his robes james if you re finished can we pleasse get some dancing in she asked good humouredly nice one your friend is by the way ignores me the whole bloody night and then leaves without so much as a goodbye i cantbelieve i agreed to this steph honestly i off to find someone who can at least vaguely show me a good time her friend huffed and she stormed off to a group of boys nearby steph just shrugged and pulled james to the dance floor the band was playing a fast tune and celestina warbeck was dancing about as she sang on stage james grinned at his date even though the pit in his stomach had made yet another re appearance the dance would be over soon and he still hadnttalked to lily steph had turned out to be more fun than he d expected but he could only focus on lily at the moment seeing lily sitting alone smiling at wood who was dancing with his little sister james excused himself politely and headed in her direction steph though showing a little disappointment merely waved her consent and began dancing with a group of her giggling friends lily sat resting her feet as david danced with his fourth year sister she glanced away for a second and saw a tall boy with glasses approaching her cautiously trying to avoid his gaze she looked towards ivana who now had marcus hands slightly below her waist as they danced this was not enough to distract her from the low voice that said into her ear evans we need to talk turning her head she was now aware of how close their faces were their lips only inches apart grudgingly she agreed i suppose you re right hang on a sec james impatiently scuffed his foot on the ground as lily went over to wood to whisper something in his ear wood lifted his head to look at him and despite giving him a friendly smile and nod james could see the warning he held in his eyes not knowing how to react james simply returned the nod and tried to stifle a shrug should we go outside then it a bit quieter lily was saying loudly over the music when she approached him james nodded he then gestured for her to go through the side door first after following her after walking in silence for a while to lily horror she found they were under the same dreaded beech tree james lifted his eyes which had been focused on the floor to meet hers as he opened his mouth to speak remus was searching for some trace of emotion on diya face they were sitting outside the grand hall on a bench in the courtyard because remus had something to tell her he had finally confessed that he was a werewolf to her their relationship had gotten too deep to not lily had told him when he confided in her he sat now waiting for her reaction dreading the thought of her hating him for this for this curse he d had no control over diya sat silently running the new information over in her head at a rapid pace remus a werewolf kind calm gentle remus she couldnteven imagine she opened her mouth to speak oh remus it must be so difficult for you she said her eyes full of worry remus felt elated she didnthate him he finally confessed his secret to someone he really cared about diya was different to marilee he could trust her because he knew how she d changed for him well i sorta used to it y know i just glad you re not scared of me he said shuddering at the thought scared of you i couldntbe remus even if you tried in fact she trailed off raising an eyebrow suggestively it sort of sexy remus eyes became round as she kissed him passionately when they finally broke apart he grinned impishly and held her hand as they crossed through the grand hall to exit on their way to gryffindor tower for some alone time sirius breathed a sigh of relief as gregory corner asked to cut in on his dance with emmeline she was getting quite exhausting really just as he went to sit down he saw remus pulled diya out of the grand hall she was giggling and hurrying after him excitedly sirius laughed and called out to his friend as the couple passed remus rushed over quickly and asked hurriedly what where exactly are you two going sirius questioned knowingly unable to conceal the cheeky grin on his face shut up padfoot remus said beaming pushing his friend playfully off his chair he then hurried back to the still giggling diya and whispered something in her ear as they exited the hall sirius sat on the floor still laughing he watched the couples dance a moment until his eyes came to rest on the familiar back of a familiar blonde russian girl he knew the something wrong with this picture however was that prick forsynthe with his hands far far south of her waist sirius stopped laughing abruptly he watched with narrowed eyes as the couple swayed to the ballad bloody marcus forsynthe thinks he can grope one of my best friends and get away with it sirius scampered up and took two steps towards ivana and marcus just at that moment marcus hands were being slapped off by an angry russian as she pelted him with insults clearly not in english the confused look on marcus face was soon replaced however by embarrassment as the girl slapped him tightly across the cheek and stormed off sirius fell back into the chair and laughed at him he laughed so hard he fell off the chair and was promptly back to sitting on the same floor spot as he had been a few moments ago ivana approached him her face changing into a puzzled smile um sirius is it cool down there or something is this what all the cool kids are doing now ivana teased a smile playing across her lips that jerk oh man you got him good gonna leave a right bruise on his cheek sirius exclaimed between laughs ivana laughed with him and joined him gracefully on the floor sirius grinned at her oh and the russian what a fiery touch did you see the look on the idiot face ivana grinned sheepishly and shoved sirius lightly they calmed down and both sat in silence for a moment when a new ballad had begun ivana wrestled with thoughts in her mind then without thinking for another moment she asked you feel like dancing sirius chuckled and nodded yeh why not i thinking even dumbledore will think we re balmy if we sit here any longer mind you he is dancing with mcgonagall so i doubt he d notice ivana giggled and rolled her eyes knowing that sirius had it fixed in his head that the headmaster and transfiguration teacher would get together eventually they strode to the dance floor and sirius put his arms around her waist ivana leaned into him draping her own arms around his neck as they moved gently to the music she tried to ignore the familiar heat creeping to her face as sirius played with a strand of her long blonde hair she smiled a little at this and looked up into his mysterious grey eyes ivana mmmm you know your hair smells like apples right sirius said in a playful tone snapping back to reality ivana forced a smile and nodded to sirius he was now looking over his shoulder look look i bet you a galleon he ll kiss her now sirius said eyeing the two dignified teachers who were waltzing nearby alright a galleon he won t ivana countered hastily trying to dismiss all hopes from minutes ago that she herself was going to be kissed certainly not by albus dumbledore however james shut his mouth noting the look on lily face james first of all about what happened you were completely wrong to do that i have a boyfriend who i care about very much and i d appreciate if he didntfind out about the you know yes lily i do know the kiss we shared perhaps and i say shared because it was obviously not a one sided affair and you know it james pressed his rehearsed lines abandoning him james it happens alright i mean if you just spring it on me accidentally i you know kiss back she argued wincing at the word kiss not the way you kissed me lily donttell me you didntfeel it that instant connection i ve never felt that with anyone before donttell me you didntfeel it too please he pleaded with her now distress so clear in his hazel eyes lily froze she didntknow what to do he was right she had felt it but it was something she had to ignore because she was with wood she wouldntand couldntcare for potter despite how much it might hurt him mistakenly taking her silence as a good sign james leaned forward slowly their lips were almost touching and he could feel the fireworks start until no james dont i sorry ok i didntfeel it i with david i i want him not you she insisted weakly pulling away from him james looked crushed defeated he nodded and turned from her taking a few steps towards the hall he then paused and turned around i love you lily evans i have for ages and i think you love me too you just dontknow it yet with that he trudged towards the castle leaving a bewildered lily trying hard to blink back tears sighing as he re entered the building james looked around sadly every hope he d had had come crashing down just moments ago every dream he had would never come true she didntfeel it and so he d have to give her up give up the love of his life feeling utterly exhausted and depressed he decided to head for bed but before he took another step a whispery voice ticked his ear lily followed james back to the hall and tried desperately not to think of the look of sadness on his face along with his last words i think you love me too you just dontknow it yet she had to find david that would put an end to all her doubts at least she hoped otherwise she had just made the biggest mistake of her life as she headed towards the exit she noticed a brown haired girl by the name of steph something or the other pressed against the wall frantically making out with a tall messy black haired boy approaching the entwined pair slowly she realised something potter james face lifted off steph and turned to face lily wearing a shocked expression love eh potter you could ve fooled me lily managed to burst out harshly she then walked from the hall with as much dignity as she could possess waiting until she was out of sight to collapse into silent sobs long one i know but i thought it was worth it please review review review a n i d like to thank the most recent reviewers for keeping me writing this
