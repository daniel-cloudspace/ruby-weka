 a n just a short unimportant chapter thank you for the reviews i ll update soon i promise chapter 13 hunny bunny harry left lupin office a few hours later with a broad smile on his face he was training to become an animagus they discussed the terms and conditions of such training and harry had agreed he was not allowed to tell anyone about his training not even teachers and he was not allowed to practice on his own just yet but harry didntcare as he headed through the entrance hall harry wondered what animal he would change into his first thought was a stag like his patronus and his father lupin had told him that even though patronus was a stag he couldntguarantee that that would be his animagus form harry was sure he would be a stag though the thing harry found most strange was that lupin had told him he couldnttell any teachers the only teachers who were aware of the training were lupin and dumbledore and it had to stay that way for now harry wondered why and came to the conclusion that it was dangerous training which most teachers wouldntapprove of harry arrived at the portrait of the fat lady gave her the password and entered the common room was unusually full but it didnttake harry long to find out why so i flew out of the way and that when seamus came in ron was sitting on top of one of the sofas dean and seamus either side of him and all of gryffindor surrounding him seamus levitated the bucket of water and yes you ve guessed it he tipped the whole lot onto blaise head ron told the crowd who burst out laughing i used this nifty little tipping charm you see seamus explained i could teach it to you some time if you like the crowd was filled with murmurs of agreement but it didntend there dean said catching the crowds attention again now blaise ran away as fast as he could he was terrified by this point thought he was going crazy seamus cut in and you wontbelieve it dean grinned we didnteven plan this but ron oh you carry on you tell it better than me ok ron grinned and everyone turned their attention to him we i still had the invisibility cloak on so i flew about him and tried to produce a patronus well of course ron isntgreat at those seamus explained thanks moony ron grinned punching him humorously so this thick smoke started to spurt out of my wand and you know what it looked like a little black cloud the crowd was in fits of laughter once more so harry decided to join in the fun with a little prank of his own he snook to the bottom of the boys staircase and summoned what he would need still listening to their every word so blaise has stopped in the entrance hall and he thinks it must have been raining ron explained to the eager crowd i know stupid or what so he just standing there harry put his plan into action he hasntnoticed the cloud yet by the way dean added so i poured a little more water onto his head ron grinned and when he looked up ron looked up to find a large black cloud had appeared above his head the crowd fell into silent giggles ron looked confused did either of you two ron began before a large spurt of water knocked him off of the sofa drenching him the crowd roared with laughter harry who had been floating above ron threw off his invisibility cloak and slid off the end of his broom to land on the sofa where ron had been sitting previously and i think it went something like that harry grinned and the crowd was in hysterics once more prongs ron called walking round the front of the sofa that was bloody evil oh go cry to your girlfriend harry called in reply grinning form ear to ear hermione who was at the front of the crowd went bright red but ron didntcare he was too busy playing his part as a marauder fine i will ron called like a five year old ron ran over to hermione and tugged childishly at her robes hermione sighed but decided to play along what she said crossing her arms harry picking on me ron moaned pouting out his bottom lip all attention was on the couple now oh was he now hermione said looking ron in the eye ron nodded sadly he pushed me and i hurt my bottom ron said again in a childish voice will you kiss it better that it hermione growled and began to chase ron around the common room once they had done a whole circuit of the room seamus and dean managed to restrain hermione ron stood in front of the sofa breathing heavily feisty little one isntshe ron said to the laughing crowd what the matter honey bunny that was it the boys could hold hermione no longer she launched herself at ron and knocked both of them onto the sofa they began rolling around hermione tickling ron as much as she could harry looked at dean who gave him the signal there nothing to see here nothing to see harry called standing in front of the sofa go to dinner and we ll see you there there nothing to see gradually people filed out and the room became quiet again say it say it ron and hermione were still on the sofa ron was lying on the sofa and hermione was straddling him her arms holding ron down at his side say you re sorry hermione ordered you re pretty strong for a girl ron said but not strong enough ron sat up and grabbed hermione around the waist before throwing her over his shoulder and standing with the others ready to go he asked with a smile put me down ron hermione shouted beating her fists on his back i wearing a skirt nice pink knickers granger seamus sniggered ha ha very funny hermione said ron tried to cover hermione bottom with her skirt but found that it was too short geez hermione ron exclaimed you need to get some clothes that fit there is nothing wrong with my clothes now put me down hermione exclaimed ron ignored her and proceeded to evacuate the common room ron hermione growled i am really not enjoying the view ron put her down at last and held out his hand why i ought to hermione mumbled as she took his hand and led the way out of the room when they reached the great hall it was nearly full but erin and daisy had saved them some space cheers girls harry grinned as they took their seats now would one of you tell me what i missed today i only heard half the story ok ron grinned to cut a long story short blaise was moaning about how hard done by he was we were joking around and dean said poor blaise it like he got a little black cloud over his head well that gave us the idea ah harry said so you gave him a black cloud more or less dean said filling up his plate then we made rain and thunder you should have been there seamus grinned all his slytherin mates ran off why d you pick on blaise harry asked harry had never had a problem with blaise before why not malfoy dean and seamus looked at each other and shook their heads sadly nah dean said softly it wouldntbe fair erin gave harry a funny look werentyou the one who said to leave off draco in the first place erin asked was i harry said in a squeaky unnatural voice yea she replied oh yea that was me harry said and continued with his dinner after dinner the marauders sat around the fire place with erin hermione and daisy not too long till our first quidditch match daisy said to the group in a couple of weeks it ravenclaw versus slytherin then mid december it us versus hufflepuff i cantwait ron smiled hufflepuff have such a lame team seamus laughed and their captain diggory is such a twat no he not moony erin sulked just cause you fancy him dean teased i do not erin exclaimed i just think he alright he d be quite good if he didntinsist on playing seeker he is a little bit big to be a seeker hermione said not necessarily erin argued the group engaged themselves in an enthusiastic heated discussion of quidditch which kept them busy until late when they cleared off to bed harry stayed behind to clear up his things from earlier he picked his invisibility cloak off of the floor and collected his broomstick from under the sofa he was just about to leave when he noticed ron and hermione they were both sound asleep on the sofa they were holding hands still and hermione was leaning her head on ron shoulder harry thought about waking them but decided against it it would be a shame to wake them from their peaceful dreams a n thank you for the reviews you guys rock this chapters pretty short sorry but i ll update quickly as for the answers to your questions it will all happen in good time i ve been asked about conversations with riddle there are more malfoy he in it lots more and as for r hr well i cantwait untill the ball either all my best angel chapter 14 another day sunday flew by in a flurry of homework and reading and before harry knew it the weekend was over monday brought colder weather and showers of rain yet nothing could dampen harry spirits potion first lesson flew by to harry as he spent the whole lesson devising a new quidditch program sirius didntmind harry working on quidditch through his lesson but harry knew lupin would harry put away his quidditch work for care of magical creatures and was glad he did this lesson they had moved away from unicorns and were revising nifflers lupin told the class they probably didntneed to revise them yet but might as well while he still had some nifflers from the lower years work the lesson proved to be extremely enjoyable and harry was glad he participated but went straight back to quidditch as soon as it had finished harry spent lunch explaining some of his plans to the team and during charms he perfected his game plan during transfiguration harry tried to explain his new plan to the other marauders but was sadly unsuccessful if you think you are going to spend this lesson discussing quidditch you have another thing coming mr potter mcgonagal said strictly if i not mistaken you have the quidditch pitch booked for today i sure you will have plenty of time with your team mates then now continue with your work harry went back to transfiguring his daisy but it wouldntgrow more than two petals and its center was oddly gold harry couldnthelp but think it resembled a snitch apparently harry and mcgonagal were on the same wave length i think some of us are getting bored of flowers and are getting distracted mcgonagal told the class whilst examining harry daisy next lesson we will start something new and come back to this at a later date class dismissed as the marauders made their way down the corridor they passed lupin who was struggling carrying a large stack of books would you be able to help me carry these to my office harry lupin asked sure harry said and took some of the books we can help as well if you like dean said no thank you lupin smiled i think i alright now come harry i ll catch you guys later harry said and followed lupin to his office once they were inside and harry had put his books down it was apparent why lupin had chosen him to help animagus transformations for beginners harry read off one of the books spines animagi through the ages do i need to read all these some of them lupin said as he put his pile of books on his desk beside harry s and began to look through them lets see lupin chose five books from the pile and handed them to harry these will do for now lupin smiled these cover the basic to the more finer points of animagi training i will need you to read these all with haste now to the difficult part lupin took harry through a series of exercises some which he had covered last lesson they were basic but still difficult to master for harry harry had little success through the first hour of work but lupin had patience and by the end harry had made much progress some things harry did with hardly any problems like making his hair grow he d been doing that subconsciously since as far back as he could remember things like changing his eye color he found a little harder he had always treasured his eyes because they were just like his mothers and he found it hard to part with them the one thing harry found impossible was hiding his scar however much he wanted it to go away it just wouldn t either way harry had made remarkable progress lupin revealed that the marauder seniors hadntbeen able to do this sort thing until after months of training even though harry transformations were short and often messy lupin was still amazed i must admit i surprised lupin told harry at the end of the lesson your concentration it astounding i really thought i d have trouble making you take this seriously but you ve really surprised me i want to do this harry said with determination i really do it going to take hard work but i can handle it you ve really grown up harry lupin said in a fatherly manor now go back to your common room and have some rest transforming really takes it out of you eat some chocolate too i daresay you have plenty of it harry arrived back in the common room to find it empty dinner harry sighed to himself and ran upstairs to retrieve some chocolate before heading to the great hall when harry arrived he was met with the familiar calls of the marauders prongs oi over here we saved you a seat prongsie harry took his seat and piled his plate so where have you been dean asked with lupin harry said casually just discussing my fabulous grades or lack of them seamus muttered and the others laughed no seriously dean said you were with him for hours the other day then you disappear off again today how long can you talk about grades look just dontworry harry said pouring some pumpkin juice you ll find out when the time is right ron gave harry a worried glance and harry shook his head hey called two friendly voices hi daisy erin seamus said erin and daisy found themselves seats by the marauders so quidditch practice after dinner erin grinned and helped herself to some potatoes yea and i ve got some great new game plan harry said enthusiastically another one daisy sighed you just told us one at lunch well i thought of a better one harry explained this way the hufflepuffs dontstand a chance i thought your motto was plans are for rubbish teams erin said you said that we could beat any team easily without a plan well i trying something new harry said defensively well it better work dean said as dessert appeared it will harry said now where ginny we need the whole team if i going to explain this it bad enough that we couldntfind her at lunch where is she where do you think she is seamus said motioning down the table ginny was sitting with a large group of girls she was obviously the center of attention she was talking animatedly to the group who were giggling uncontrollably either side two girls who were obviously her sidekicks one had long wavy black hair and lots of freckles the other had curly blonde hair and sky blue eyes harry was surprised to see hermione on the outside of the group sitting with lavender and parvati harry smiled she didntseem too pleased with the seating arrangement doesntit bother you harry asked erin and daisy in a slightly hushed voice the way that ginny is best friends with you then she dumps you for them erin and daisy looked at harry with almost questioning faces i mean when you re with us you three are like best friends harry elaborated but then she goes off with her little group doesntit bother you yes it bothers us erin said picking at her food but that just the way it is have you only just noticed daisy asked no it just it never really bothered me before harry said looking at ginny how do you stand it you don t erin said you just accept that that the way it is why dontyou say something to her harry asked i know i couldntstand it she uses you it not like that daisy said she just has her duty as popular girl to go around with her little group and give them advise about boys and gossip and stuff they arenther real friends erin explained to harry she doesnttalk to them about important stuff if she has anything she needs to talk about she comes to us ginny isntquite as she seems daisy said she goes deeper than all those other girls she not as shallow as you d think yea erin said in the evening she comes back to our dorm and she really quiet she asks us how our day was and we talk about any problems we have then she writes in her diary for ages before reading and going to bed she acts all tough and cool daisy concluded but inside she just like the rest of us insecure why the sudden show of interest erin asked suspiciously no reason harry said and took a swig of his pumpkin juice after dinner gryffindor quidditch team trekked up to quidditch pitch ginny left her little giggly group and joined erin and daisy as usual in no time the team was dressed and ready harry spent a while explaining his new plan before they hit the pitch the team flew well but harry couldnthelp seeing the resemblance between neville and daisy daisy was a great flyer but very dangerous on a broomstick she kept spinning and twirling everywhere and it wasntan odd occurrence for daisy to fly off her broom usually someone would catch her or she would conjure a large cushion under her harry couldnthelp but laugh when daisy threw the quaffle at the hoops and ended up flying with it luckily ron caught her daisy that was a great shot harry said but i afraid that hufflepuff keeper will be more keen on stopping the quaffle than catching you sorry daisy said with a cute lopsided grin now lets go again harry ordered and the team got into place now go erin threw the quaffle under to ginny ginny then flew up and dropped the quaffle to daisy daisy and erin then both flew forward and daisy passed the ball over to erin erin then dropped the quaffle for ginny to catch ginny caught the quaffle but didntseem to have the strength to hold it ginny lent forward on her broom and slid straight off the front of it harry flew with incredible sped and caught ginny quite comfortably in his arms ginny are you ok harry asked looking down at her tiny limp body ginny opened her eyes i sorry ginny whispered harry started to float towards the ground i just tired i shouldnthave come to practise today it ok harry whispered not taking his eyes from her dark amber ones as long as you re alright you alright gin dean called as he landed on the ground so she gets all the sypathy erin said she fine harry called just passed out thank you harry ginny whispered and harry landed on the ground you re not the seeker for nothing nope harry grinned you can put me down now ginny said with the twinkle back in her eye harry put her down quickly but wished he hadn t ginny legs couldntseem to hold her weight harry was suddenly aware of how tired he was so he called the team to him i say we call it a day harry said everyone tired lets just head back everyone began to head back to the changing room except for ginny i gonna go straight back to the castle ginny said and began to walk away she took a few steps and her legs gave way harry rushed forward and put one of ginny arms over his shoulders and tried to take her weight i ok ginny said edging away from harry i fine harry watched ginny limp up towards the castle what the matter with her ron asked nobody in particular i wish i knew harry murmured review go on it wonttake a minute a n another chapter i have up to chapter 32 planned yay so i going to hurry up posting these next few chapters so you d better keep up with your reviews always angel chapter 15 the counsel of padfoot harry didntsee ginny the next morning at breakfast but decided not to worry as her friends werentin the great hall either harry sat with dean and seamus who were discussing quidditch tactics but for once harry didntfeel like joining in harry hadntfelt like himself all morning he d been snappy with ron who went off in a huff he d slammed a door in one boys face and been rude to a first year who had lost her cat there was only one word to describe how harry felt drained he felt like he d missed a nights sleep or just had a long quidditch practice harry put his hands in his pockets and found that one contained a chocolate frog harry remembered lupin had told him to eat chocolate after his lesson but in his rush to get to quidditch harry had forgotten harry opened the packet but couldntbring himself to eat it the sweet smell sickened him harry took a swig of pumpkin juice before being interrupted hey big bro erin exclaimed in a squeaky voice how life treating you not too great harry admitted as erin took a seat next to him where are the love birds erin asked the love oh yea harry mumbled i dontknow i moaned at ron this morning and he went off in a huff haventseen him since ouch erin said taking a slice of toast you three are spending a lot of time together lately i didntthink you got along so well with hermione she alright harry said unsurely i recall one time where you called her a stuck up whore erin said pulling a thinking face who should i quote mind her own business well things change harry said looking down at his plate since ron dating her i ve decided to try to get along with her better and i ve found out that she really alright right erin said but didntseem convinced a lot of things seem to have changed lately really harry said in a voice that wasnthis own i hadntnoticed hmmm erin said pouring herself a drink well i ve noticed erin gave harry a look which made him feel extremely uncomfortable it was the kind of look lavender and parvati wore when they left trelawney room in the evening it was a kind of knowing look hiya said daisy as she took a seat next to erin why the long face no reason erin answered simply i ve found out where ginny is daisy said and harry ears pricked up she staying in the hospital wing this morning apparently she over did it at quidditch practice is she alright harry asked i think so daisy answered skye and mitzy wouldnttell me anything else i had to beg them for that much information about ginny what was that about our favorite chaser seamus asked hey erin and daisy chorused i thought i was your favorite chaser wormtail erin said pulling a fake sad face well you thought wrong dean said so how is she she fine daisy answered as far as i can tell i might go and see her before lessons erin said or try rather i doubt i ll be let it it worth a try dean said me and moony will come with you so will i daisy said putting her drink down you coming prongs not right now maybe later harry said rubbing his aching head give her a hug from me erin and daisy exchanged smiles and knowing looks sure daisy said sweetly before the four of them left harry sat alone for a while before he was joined by ron and hermione hey harry ron said cheerfully you ok i sorry about this morning mate harry blurted out i just snapped that ok ron said as long as you re alright now ron and hermione began breakfast are you alright harry hermione asked is there anything you want to tell us no harry muttered i just tired are you sure hermione asked yes harry said sternly actually no there is something it erin i think she getting suspicious about you know what hermione whispered harry nodded his head she said things have been changing a lot lately harry revealed for one thing the old harry ron and hermione donthang out together and the old harry doesntlike the old hermione very much oh hermione said frowning but she couldntreally know you probably misinterpreted what she was saying yea ron said putting his knife and fork down you ve probably got the wrong end of the wand pardon harry said looking very confused wrong end of the stick hermione explained ok then harry said before a friendly hoot caused him to drop his fork headwig headwig gave harry a letter nipped him affectionately on the ear and flew quickly off again harry opened the letter and read it to himself dear harry i glad you re well that prank you played on snape was brilliant it things like that that make me proud to say that you re my son i ve also heard about the new lessons you re taking with lupin and i couldntbe prouder things are quite busy at work but i wont say much incase you re not alone reading this letter hopefully i will be around for christmas but your mother and i will be on call if we re needed there no need to be so modest about your christmas gift i

sister that there a christmas ball hope the young girl you have your eye on will say yes this time see you at christmas son dad harry smiled he couldntwait to meet his dad and it seemed he would have to for much longer who that from ron asked just my dad harry smiled christmas arrangements he wants to buy me a new broom for christmas i ve asked my dad for a new broomstick ron grinned we can afford one you see hermione grinned fondly at ron it funny how you base so much on material things hermione mused well what do you want for christmas ron asked ideally a way to get home hermione said seriously there was silence for a moment i think we ought to talk to dumbledore hermione said but not till after christmas please harry begged i so close to meeting my parents harry handed hermione the letter and she read it over she gave harry a sympathetic face before something hit her what lessons with lupin hermione asked this says lupin giving you extra lessons it nothing harry said snatching the letter back i just flunking care of magical creatures no you re not ron said you re one on the best in the class are you taking some sort of secret lesson like you did with snape last year hermione asked look i canttell you harry said angrily so just leave it harry was suddenly aware of how tired he was he looked at hermione hurt face and ron protective arm around her sorry harry muttered lets go the bells going to go any minute hermy hermy over here a 6th year girl was calling hermione she was standing with lavender parvati and a few other girls harry recognized her as one of ginny popular friends i coming skye hermione called and added to ron and harry i ll see you later hermione squeezed ron hand before letting go and running over to the girls harry stared at ron hands what ron asked apparently confused that is going to take some getting used to harry said shaking the thought from his mind oh yea ron said realizing and going red but it not as if we get a choice i know harry sighed ron and harry exited the great hall and met dean and seamus outside did you see ginny harry asked no seamus moaned the stupid nurse in there wouldntlet us in madame pomfrey ron asked no the other one seamus said we ve got defense against the dark arts first lesson dean announced and i really dontfeel like going me either seamus said lets not go harry was about to object when he remembered what snape had said to him the old harry regularly skipped snape lessons ok harry decided so what do you wanna do how about we visit padfoot senior seamus said sounds good to me ron grinned and they headed off by the time they got to sirius office everybody was in lessons hello dean said as he knocked on the door your favorite four students have come to see you i sure he doesnthave a lesson now seamus said he doesn t a familiar voice chimed but you do the door opened and behind it stood sirius and to what reason do i owe this honor sirius asked with his arms crossed need my great prank advice again you are the god of all pranks dean said nodding his head but not this time we just came for a visit harry explained of course sirius smiled come in when harry got inside he found that sirius office was like no other teachers office he had ever seen the walls were bright red and covered with various posters the shelves and cupboards were filled with more pranks than potions and on his desk laid a large bag of dungbombs had to confiscate these from a student sirius explained picking up the beg disgraceful just disgraceful sirius opened a cupboard to his left and harry was not surprised to see that it was filled with bags of dungbombs sirius chucked the new bag on top and shut the door so he said as he sat on his chair any news nothing much seamus said i suppose you ve heard about our little rain cloud prank oh yes sirius smiled evilly and i was nice enough to show concern in blaise that very same day really dean asked with a raised eyebrow oh yes sirius said you see it my job as a teacher to watch out for the pupils so when blaise was leaving the great hall i said to him are you ok you look like you have a little black cloud above your head the boys burst out laughing that was mean ron laughed what did he do started frantically checking above his head for a cloud sirius grinned childishly a couple of hours later the boys staggered out of sirius office holding their stomachs laughing you boys had better run along sirius advised tell snape you missed his first lesson because you needed to discuss a problem which we ve not sorted out good plan harry grinned lets go harry led the marauders towards defense against the dark arts but then changed his mind i not going to defense harry stated i still not feeling too good what seamus asked shows how observant you lot are harry said shaking his head i didntfeel too good this morning and i still dontnow i going to the hospital wing see you later prongs ron said as harry headed in the opposite direction harry moped to the hospital wing his limbs feeling very heavy he d felt ok in sirius company but as soon as he was left alone with his thoughts he couldnthelp but feel tired when harry arrived in the hospital wing it was completely empty except for one person what are you doing here asked ginny she was sitting snuggled in a bed at the far end of the room she wore silky cream pajamas and her hair was unkempt her face was almost as white as her sheets which made her freckles stand out and harry couldnthelp but notice how she had bags under her eyes nice to see you too harry smiled sarcastically walking towards her bed how re you feeling i was alright until you showed up she said with a sly smile oh really harry said as he perched on the end of her bed so what calls you here potter ginny asked didntfeel like going to your lesson no harry said in mock hurt that why i skipped my first lesson i here now because i feel sick have another dodgy meal ginny smiled referring to their last meeting in the hospital wing no actually harry said i just feeling a little tired mind if i jump in there with you harry was surprised at his own daring and went red ginny reached forward and hit harry on the shoulder ok ok harry muttered i ll find my own bed harry took the bed on ginny left he climbed in and pulled the cover up to his neck pretty nice harry smiled in approval what are you doing screeched a nurse but it wasntmadame pomfrey harry recognized her but he couldntthink where from there was something about her manor that harry new and he had defiantly seen those glasses before as she stomped towards him harry realized who said was moaning myrtle ah harry said the thing is is there a problem madame pomfrey had popped her head around the door this imbecile has just climbed into one of my nice clean beds moaning myrtle screamed calm yourself myrtle madame pomfrey said and led her to sit down in a chair if your not careful you re going to have to retire early now what is the problem mr potter i feel really tired harry said honestly too tired to go to lessons madame pomfrey asked harry nodded his head well you re not the first she motioned towards ginny bed ok now an explanation i dontknow harry said unsurely it not like i ve missed any sleep i went to bed at the same time i always do have you taken part in any new activities madame pomfrey asked knowingly harry nodded his head well i suggest you start to look after yourself a little better i ll let it go this once but i dontexpect to see you in here again with the same problem thank you harry said as he rested his head on the pillow madame pomfrey began to leave the room their time gets filled with so many activities madame pomfrey murmured sucks all the life out of them if i ve said it once i ve said it a thousand times poppy myrtle said school is becoming too stressful well in my day the two nurses left the room and harry rolled round to face ginny and found that she was already looking at him see something you like harry grinned cheekily ginny shook her head but smiled i wasntlooking at you she explained i was just thinking yea harry smiled that what they all say madame pomfrey appeared again with a steaming goblet she handed it to harry it a dreamless sleep potion she said this should keep you sleeping till about lunch thanks harry said and madame pomfrey left swiftly harry took a sip sweet dreams ginny said softly harry was about to make a witty remark about dreaming of her when he fell into a deep sleep he dreamt he was dancing at the ball with ginny just like he had seen in divination they were waltzing and twirling the only difference was that ginny was wearing her silky cream pajamas infact everyone was wearing pajamas ginny looked angry and asked harry where his pajamas were harry explained that he d left them in the chamber of secrets when he d gone to feed his cat ginny got really angry and ordered that harry should go and get them else she would go and get married to dobby harry begged her not too but she wouldntbudge dobby started to dance in front of harry saying i ve got your wheezy sir i ve got you re wheezy please harry begged i only caught the snitch so sirius could have a letter harry suddenly woke up he rubbed his eyes and put on his glasses felling better asked lupin lupin was sitting at the end of harry bed and smiling his regular smile yea harry said looking around ginny was gone i guessing that you didnttake a rest last night like i asked you to lupin presumed harry nodded him head sadly i didnthave time he explained i had quidditch practice well maybe next time you ll put your health first lupin said wisely or else i will be forced to stop your training i disappointed in you harry i thought you were mature enough to look after yourself i am harry argued i just forgot well dontin future lupin advised i would rather you didntmiss any more lessons and i sure your parents will agree with me that your grades are more important than animagus training i ll be more careful next time harry said sincerely good lupin smiled fatherly now eat some chocolate and i ll see you later harry took the now squashed chocolate frog from his pocket and ate it in one go you re awake madame pomfrey said as she entered the room and feeling better i can see you re free to leave when you wish and i suggest that you leave soon as your afternoons lessons will be beginning shortly harry jumped out of bed straightened his robes and headed straight to history of magic there was no point in trying to find hermione ron or any of the other marauders as by the time he would have found them the would have had to leave for lessons harry arrived outside his class with five minutes to spare he lent against the wall and heard voices coming from inside the classroom harry wondered what sort of company riddle would have so with his curiosity getting the better of him he pulled the door open a jar it just isntme riddle sighed i just not a teacher you re a great teacher said ginny voice no riddle said i can teach but my hearts never in it i just dontenjoy teaching it not fulfilling enough what not fulfilling about teaching tomorrows leaders about great people from the past ginny asked i think it a brilliant job it is riddle said but i cantsee myself doing this forever i always dreamed when i was a child that i would be a somebody you are ginny reassured him no i mean a real somebody riddle said his voice sounding harsher than before i ve always had quite a taste for power i thought a school would fulfill me i could become a teacher and work my way up it just isntenough anymore well maybe you just need a change ginny suggested you need to find out who you really are maybe you could travel that sweet ginny riddle said his voice softening again but at my age it just doesntseem like the right thing at my age i should have done everything i want to in life it never to late ginny said you should give it a go if teaching really isntfor you then you should find out what is thank you riddle said almost fondly it nice to have a pupil who i can talk to i afraid the professors donttake me seriously anymore they underestimate me but they ll be sorry someday someday when i have power i d do anything for a little power the bell rang and made harry jump he d been so absorbed in the conversation he d forgotten where he was harry opened the door and entered the room to find that ginny was about to leave we have got to stop meeting like this ginny said shaking her head some would call it fate harry smiled some wouldn t ginny said as she left the room a n a favorite chapter of mine as draco malfoy plays a big part in it yay and there plenty more of draco to come now people have been asking alot of questions about this story so i going to try and answer a few if you have anymore questions keep them coming as i more than happy to answer them keep reading as the plot thickens angel faq why does harry still have his scar harry still has his scar because he is still the same harry his body was transported to the new world rather then just his mind is there a tom ginny pairing in this story nope ginny talks alot with riddle because she understands him more than anyone else hint hint the pairings in this story are ron hermione andharry ginny mainly with mild dean erin draco hermione and others if you dontlike the pairing draco hermione dontbe put off by this is only mild and fits well with the story why does hermione still have her cat as the only reason she got him was because of scabbers etc well i just figured that hermione would have ended up with crookshanks one way or another i believe that if she d walked into the mm on her own and seen crookshanks she would have felt sorry for him and bought him thats her nature why does ginny keep turning up in teachers class rooms the only teachers class rooms she is ever in i think are lupin and riddles she in riddles because riddle need someone to confide in and ginny understands him more than anyone and cares about his future she has a reason to be in lupin room but i wont tell you why as it would ruin the story chapter 16 sympathy wednesday dragged by for harry it was a beautiful bright day a gently breeze flew through the air the sky was the brightest blue yet all harry could think about was riddle how close ginny had been to him had riddle pulled this ginny in the way he had done with ginny in her first year yet it seemed like quite an innocent conversation between an educator and his favorite scholar harry figured he shouldntjump to conclusions harry didntdivulge this information to ron or hermione but felt it necessary to keep to himself they had never met the riddle from their world before so they didntknow what he was like suspicions haunted harry mind all day the crammed inside his brain and left space for nothing else they seemed to ease away after harry took a late night stroll he let his thoughts blow away with the winter breeze and felt refreshed when he entered the common room once more as harry headed towards the boys staircase he found ron and hermione sitting in front of the fire reading harry found the occurrence a little bit odd it wasntthe fact that they were reading ron read quite often and hermione never stopped reading it was how they were reading ron sat comfortably on the settee with one arm round the back of the it coincidently that happened to be where hermione shoulders were hermione was sitting snuggled up to ron leaning sideways onto his chest they were both reading a book which was propped on ron legs not interrupting anything am i harry asked of course not hermione smiled looking up to meet harry eyes innocently if you dontmind me asking why are you up so late harry asked prefect duties ron said glumly we just found out about them today the sixth years usually watch the common room like in our world hermione explained but apparently they re getting too tired so we have to do them today fun harry smiled sarcastically it alright though hermione said because i found out that i still head girl in this world who head boy harry asked still draco malfoy hermione said turning her nose up well we should get back to our prefect duties you re more than welcome to join us though if you like ron said honestly no harry chuckled as he headed for the stairs i wouldntlike to impose harry woke up early on thursday morning to find ron bed still empty he took a quick shower got dressed and ready for school and put some gel in his hair before leaving his dormitory as harry passed through the common room he found that ron and hermione were still in the same position as the night before but fast asleep harry contemplated waking them up before anyone could see but found that he was already to late dontwake them said ginny voice softly they look so peaceful peaceful harry said it quite disturbing if you ask me ginny was standing at the bottom of the girls staircase across the room from where harry was how can you say that ginny smiled still looking at the couple they look so cute awww cooed erin as she entered the common room how sweet ready to go ginny nodded see you later harry ginny smiled and with a swish of red hair the girls were gone harry made his way to the great hall alone when he arrived many groups asked harry if he d like to join them but harry declined he wasntin the mood to entertain today as he had nothing better to do harry decided to head to his first lesson harry read his timetable and found that it was history of magic harry headed there is haste wondering if riddle would be there yet riddle was as harry approached he found that the classroom door was open a jar riddle was sitting behind his desk and looked as if he was marking something do you mind if i come in harry asked unsure of what he was doing not at all riddle said with a forced but honest smile is there something on your mind kind of harry confessed it just i overheard your conversation with ginny weasley the other day oh riddle said putting down his quill well dontmind that we were just discussing my giving up teaching not that it definite yet right harry said taking a seat arentyou happy teaching no riddle said softly not anymore it just isntenough anymore i ve always wanted to be someone important to have power and influence but you do harry said almost confused you influence the people in your classes not that kind of influence riddle explained the thing is i ve always wanted to make history not teach it riddle went back to his marking and harry couldnthelp but have a pang of sympathy for the old man before him well it never too late harry said in an encouraging voice i know riddle said on a more serious note and as soon as an opportunity comes up i will take it the tone of riddle voice startled harry a little because it was a familiar one harry stood up form his chair and riddle eyes were brought to his going somewhere riddle asked i i was just going to get some breakfast harry stammered i can bring you some if you like that would be splendid riddle smiled and harry left the room swiftly harry got the breakfast from the great hall and passed ron and hermione on the way out so you finally woke up harry said the duo blushed yea ron said scratching the back of his neck we have really got to stop doing that i wouldntworry harry said everyone thinks you re a couple anyway harry comment caused them to blush even more where are you going with that toast hermione asked to change the subject professor riddle harry muttered i was at his class early so i said i d get him some breakfast first you cantstay in his class ron grinned and now you turn up early make up your mind it not like that harry said you ve just realized that in this world riddle isntan evil dark wizard hermione questioned with a smirk maybe harry said now lets go ron took hermione hand again uncomfortably and they were off the trio arrived at riddle room with enough time for riddle to eat a slice of toast before the bell rang once the class was seated riddle began today we will be studying enid the evil riddle announced not that it was necessarily an appropriate name why seamus asked confused wasntshe evil she made muggle hunting legal for a short period of time riddle said with no emotion in his voice sounds pretty evil to me dean muttered but is there really evil riddle asked and the class was transfixed enid just took power the wrong sort of power piped up hannah abbot riddle looked seriously at hannah giving her the kind of look harry recognized as snape s then carried on if there is one lesson young people need to learn in life it is this riddle said seriously there is no good and evil just power and those who take it people arentborn evil harry raised his hand would you like to add something harry riddle asked i disagree with you harry said in a serious tone you re right people arentborn evil people can grow to be something we ve come to know as evil but that not really evilness would you care to elaborate riddle asked sounding more interested you re right harry said looking riddle squarely in the eye there is no good and evil just selfishness selfish people who will ruin the lives of others to improve their own lives people who cantsee beyond themselves to the people they re hurting and the suffering they re causing selfish heartless people who grow to be what we know as evil i wouldntcall it selfishness riddle argued just smart strong people taking power when the opportunities arrive it selfishness harry argued bluntly nothing but that could cause someone to end another persons life well if it is selfishness riddle said why are people not born selfish and evil a wise man once told me harry said that it is our choices that show who we really are far more than our abilities a short silence followed passionate words riddle said to harry then turned to the class opinions vary which is why we are going to discuss them today split up into groups read page 306 of your books and discuss begin harry left the classroom later fuming how can he say that harry asked ron and hermione opinions vary he was practically saying that it was alright to kill muggles well it what he believes in hermione said he truly believes that evilness isnta factor that it just power it selfishness harry muttered and you put your point across pretty well ron grinned the look on his face before today i thought that people werentborn evil harry said i thought it was how you were brought up now i seriously changing my mind he not evil harry hermione said just opinionated too opinionated if you ask me harry grouched harry spend the whole of herbology calming down and by lunch time was back to normal harry enjoyed his lunch with the marauders who seemed quite impressed with harry passionate speech that was fantastic dean stated simply fantastic you really put riddle in his place seamus grinned well i thought he was wrong harry said simply and he was bit of a weird one riddle is seamus said not taking it too seriously if only you knew ron sighed ron and harry took a walk after they d eaten and tried to make the most of their time outside supposed to snow soon ron said looking quite pleased at the prospect would be nice harry smiled looking out onto the grounds it was a stormy wet day and the soil grounds had turned to mud the leaves were flying off the trees which blew this way and that in the wind harry looked down towards the lake and out at the forbidden forest before something caught his eye it was a crowd of students pushing around a boy with blond hair harry automatically thought of neville and it seemed ron had the same thing in mind they both rushed down to the scene to have the shock of their lives the blond boy who was being pushed around was not neville but malfoy a large group of slytherins were taking it in turns to push him into the mud or kick him to the ground malfoy didntlook cocky or angry at all he looked scared his usually slick hair was hanging in his face and his cold gray eyes had an odd spark in them malfoy eyes were usually dull and lifeless as if trying to shut off emotions and stop people from seeing inside today you could see how malfoy was feeling just by looking in his stormy gray eyes his eyes showed fear malfoy closed his eyes as one boy kicked him in the back he lay there pain seizing through his body he didntmove harry found it unsettling how still he was blaise picked malfoy from the ground by the scruff of the neck and punched him harshly stomach harry was about to step in to help malfoy when someone held his shoulder back it was lupin that enough boys lupin said without an ounce of warmth in his voice blaise you are to report to your head of house immediately the rest of you have detention i will not tolerate bullying lupin levitated malfoy injured body and left swiftly harry couldnthelp but feel a pang of guilt right in the pit of his stomach do you think he ll be ok said a shaking voice it was hermione standing a little behind the boys i got professor lupin as quickly as i could she said looking scared and worried i wasntgoing to interfere but they were really hurting him hermione looked truly scared he ll be fine ron said comfortingly madame pomfrey can fix anything you didntsee it hermione said in a small voice they just picked on him for no reason they started throwing punches and curses then they were kicking him in the head come here harry said and pulled hermione into a hug she sobbed silently into his shoulder a few people around gave harry a funny look on second thought hug ron harry said he supposed to be your boyfriend not me people might get suspicious ron took harry place of hugging hermione who buried her head in his chest ron patted hermione back unsurely and whispered comfortingly in her ear do you think you could tell us what happened harry asked quietly after a minute it was horrible hermione said not letting go of ron the gang of slytherins were picking on malfoy brother so malfoy tried to help then they turned of him malfoy has a brother harry asked and a sister hermione replied isabelle is in her 5th year and sebastian is in his 3rd why does he have a brother and sister when he doesntin our world harry asked confused i dontknow hermione answered i suppose lucius wanted more children not that he lived to see them grow up he died 13 years ago probably before sebastian was even born maybe that why malfoy got beaten up and isnta bullying slime ball ron said in our world he grew up with lucius that cantdo anyone any good you re probably right harry said maybe without lucius influence malfoy is a better person the trio headed to transfiguration after lunch and took seats at the front of the class today we will be studying how to turn mice into kittens mcgonagal told the class this is a very difficult spell and i trust you will all take it seriously as to not harm the animals now read page 235 and i will be right will you harry followed mcgonagal gaze and found her looking to the half open door standing outside the room was malfoy come in dear mcgonagal said why are you late i had a problem with blaise malfoy said not in his usual cocky voice but sounding sad as malfoy entered the room harry realized why since his fight at lunchtime malfoy had picked up an additional bruise he was wearing a large black ring around his eye and it was throbbing mr malfoy please sit down mcgonagal said wearing a shocked expression let me get the headmaster no malfoy said holding his face it bad enough but the headmaster must hear of this mcgonagal said looking worried blaise must be punished the more you punish him the more he ll punish me please donttell anyone not now malfoy begged fine mcgonagal said looking sorry for the blonde boy we ll discuss this later take your seat draco found a spare seat at the front of the room to hermione right he put his bag down wincing as he moved his shoulder he pulled out his book put it on the table and opened it to the appropriate page thank you he whispered to hermione with a small smile if you hadntgot someone i dontknow what would have happened hermione looked from his genuine smile to the sincerity in his eyes it nothing she said bemused but returning the smile before going back to her reading the end of the lesson came quicker than harry thought it would harry packed up his things at an unusually fast speed and ended up knocking his bottle on ink onto the floor along with his quill i ll meet you back in the common room harry told ron and hermione and bent down on the floor to clear up the mess that was a great lesson professor malfoy said on his way out and you did some great wand work to go with it mcgonagal said fondly now run along to the hospital wing and get those bruises sorted out and remember if you ever need anyone to talk to i always here oh and i will be informing your head of house about this incident i ll get it sorted out thank you malfoy said with a sorry half smile malfoy exited the classroom just as professor flitwick entered what happened to him flitwick asked mcgonagal a look of concern on his face blaise mcgonagal said sadly i believe blaise had been picking on young mr malfoy again and it getting serious serious his injuries are getting worse mcgonagal explained i do feel sorry for him everything seems to happen to young mr malfoy both his parents pass away and he left to bring up his younger siblings even now that he at school things are still difficult he continually being beaten up because his father was the dark lord these are supposed to be the best years of his life flitwick shook his head sadly as mcgonagal walked around her desk it a shame mcgonagal sighed he such a lovely boy i have no idea why he got sorted into slytherin the two teachers left the classroom and harry picked up his ink sodden quill wishing for the first time that he was back home again feeling sorry for malfoy remember to review a n just a nice chapter though i d update as you nice people are giving me so many nice reviews our aim is to hit 250 reviews before christmas and or course for me to have posted all the chapters up till christmas that means all the chapters up to about 35 ouch maybe not i ll just have to do my best always angel chapter 17 snowing time is said to fly when you re having fun and it did indeed for the golden trio before they knew it it was december december brought round snow and sleet a predicted batch of flu and most of all the christmas ball there had been many discussions regarding the christmas ball but no arrangements for dates had been made except for ron and hermione most people had decided it would be better to leave it to nearer the time they would worry about it then things between ron and hermione had changed a lot towards the end of december they were just little changes but the kind of thing a best friend would notice they held hands more often gave each other pet names and often exchanged a hug before they went off to bed at night harry supposed he was jumping to conclusions as no one else had batted an eyelid but it just seemed a little unusual on the very first day of december as if on cue snow began to pour from the sky it was if someone had opened the heavens harry loved the snow but was not looking forward to doing care of magical creatures in it or quidditch practice for that matter harry decided that missing one quidditch practice probably wouldntmatter though as the team was playing so well even though their first match was approaching hufflepuff and ravenclaw had had their first match in late november hufflepuff had won but only by 10 points and because cedric diggory had caught the snitch ravenclaw were the favorite to win because cho chang was their seeker and was currently dating diggory diggory had shown no mercy to his girlfriend on the pitch and caught the snitch while ravenclaw was ahead harry found it unsettling to see cedric and cho walk together hand in hand but he felt no jealously rise in him when he saw cho kiss cedric on the cheek he was finally over her in fact his dreams had recently been troubled with the silhouette of another girl which he would never admit to his friends this girl with long flaming hair dark playful eyes and a face full of summer freckles she would laugh and play and harry and her would dance to a tune only the two of them could hear harry tried not to think of these dreams he supposed such thoughts had come about since he had had the vision in the crystal ball he just couldntsee himself going to the ball with anyone other than ginny now it probably didnthelp that wherever harry went he always seemed to pass ginny before lessons in the library by the quidditch pitch even when harry turned up or was leaving animagus training ginny always seemed to be there the marauders were sitting eating breakfast on a snowy morning in december when the subject of the ball arose i haventchosen my date yet seamus explained there a rumour that bryony grey and padma patil are both going to ask me erin also told me that mitzi quite likes me and i know that lavender brown has a thing for me decisions decisions ron mused buttering some toast i glad i donthave to go through this date thing i going with hermione and that that but have you formally asked hermione dean said and ron gave him a quizzing look i just saying you know what hermione like she as hot as hell but a right suborn pain sometimes i d ask her just to be sure maybe you re right ron said might be a good idea so who on your list of lucky hopefuls seamus asked dean changing the subject you know dean mumbled a few girls names being ron asked pouring himself some pumpkin juice parvati patil susan bones and skye summer just to name a few dean said not sounding really bothered not bad seamus said i d heard a rumour about parvati too apparently she liked you since 5th year so i ve heard dean smiled choosing himself another slice of toast so what about you prongs you ve been awfully quiet this morning you must have someone in mind to ask harry held his breath it was now or never i ve been thinking about asking ginny weasley harry said in a would be casual voice seamus and dean both groaned which was not the reaction harry had been expecting ron on the other hand reacted exactly as harry had predicted and spat out his pumpkin juice as the words left harry lips really harry seamus said i thought you d given up on her well harry said unsure of what to reply with she turns you down every time dean said well i think do we need to go through it again seamus asked first year you ask her if she wants to come over your house with ron at christmas she turns you down dean said nodding his head second year you get up the courage and ask her out seamus said counting on his fingers she turns you down again dean said shaking his head third year you ask her to hogsmeade seamus said she turns you down then you asked her to the valentine ball and she turns you down again dean explains the exact same thing happened in 4th 5th and 6th year seamus said counting his fingers again the winter ball that spring thing hogsmeade on numerous occasions she always turns you down and at the end if last year you swore that you d give up on her dean wined all she does is turn you down and make you look like an idiot there are plenty of other girls you know i know harry said unsure of what to make of this new information i just i think things will be different this time if you re sure seamus sighed just dontcome crying to us when she says no alright harry said and noticing ron quietness added i ve just remembered i left a book back in gryffindor tower would you come with me to go and get it ron sure ron said in a voice that was at least two octaves higher than usual the boys swiftly left the great hall and made their way to the tower since when did you fancy my sister ron exclaimed as soon as they were out o earshot i don t harry said defensively it just a ball but there are loads of great girls at hogwarts ron argued why ginny let me explain harry said awkwardly and told ron about his recurring vision that weird ron said are you sure it was you and ginny i think so harry said racking his brain it looked like us maybe you re a seer ron joked but his heart wasntin it maybe harry half smiled silence followed so you re really going to ask my sister ron asked spontaneously if you dontmind harry said shyly before adding it expected of the harry in this world so i think i should it not like it really your sister anyway she isntthe ginny you know she still my baby sister though ron exclaimed i dontwant you asking her out just because it expected of you it not just that harry argued she pretty and nice we get along well just trust me i have a feeling that it all going to work out ok ron mumbled but you better be right i dontwant to see her hurt even if she isntthe old ginny sure harry smiled now lets head back to the great hall if we re quick we can meet up with the others before the bell goes harry and ron ran back inside the great hall and over to the missing marauders haventyou two finished breakfast yet ron asked grabbing his bag lessons are going to start any minute didntyou hear dean said smiling lessons have been cancelled why ron asked seamus pointed upwards and harry and ron both looked up to the enchanted ceiling of the great hall it was snowing heavily too much snow seamus explained they ve cancelled lessons for today and maybe tomorrow if it carries on like this ron and harry grinned at each other their previous discussion forgotten i say we go out for a snow ball fight ron said and was met with grins of agreement the marauders went back to the common room and layered on hats and gloves are you going out into the snow hermione asked as she descended the girls staircase yea ron answered blushing for no apparent reason and where have you been all morning i overslept hermione explained with a small smile lavender just woke me up and told me that lessons arenton well she right dean said and we re heading out for a snowball fight did i hear the words snowball fight said erin chirpy voice dean and seamus groaned as erin and daisy made their way towards the group yes you heard right harry grinned you cantjoin us if you like but only if we play girls versus boys dean added you re on erin grinned evilly at dean but that not very fair daisy said there only two of us and four of you why dontyou join in hermione harry asked i dontknow hermione replied shyly oh please ron begged as he slid his arm comfortably around her waist and hugged her tight go on you re good at snowball fights erin said you helped us win last year daisy grinned but hermione mumbled looking pleadingly at harry please ron whispered honestly into hermione ear it would really mean a lot to me if you did hermione looked into ron adoring eyes and melted ok she sighed and the other girls cheered that not fair dean exclaimed you know what hermione like at snowball fights she vicious no she isn t erin said she just goes into the zone the zone where the only thing that matters is winning daisy added excitedly exactly seamus grumbled you re just afraid that we ll beat you erin grinned ohhh that it dean said the games on we ll meet you outside in five minutes for the snowball fight you re having a snowball fight ginny was walking across the room with mitzi and skye either side of her and a gang behind the way they walked demanded respect and they looked down on erin and daisy as if they were lower life forms yea harry answered clearing his throat everyone else seemed to have lost their tongues dean and seamus were looking for ball dates hermione and ron were busy fussing over each other and erin and daisy looked intimidated oh ginny said with a small smile do you have space on a team for one more the look on mitzi and skye faces was priceless you want to go and play in the snow mitzi asked turning her nose up yes ginny said confidently so there space on the girls team erin said in a small voice we re meeting outside in five minutes hermione explained i ll be there ginny said with a small smile but gin we re all going to chose ball robes out of mitzi magazine skye said looking down her nose well you ll have to do it without me ginny told the shocked gang so i ll see you in five gin are you sure you know what you re doing mitzi finally exclaimed positive ginny smiled and climbed the girls staircase the gang stood with blank faces for a moment before skye took charge come on then she exclaimed lets all go to the library as the gang left dean and seamus sniggered i bet they ll be lost without their little leader dean grinned no skye will keep them in line erin said and when ginny meets them later she ll be welcomed back with open arms oh well harry said now we need to go get changed we re meeting outside in five minutes remember as the group began to leave hermione sighed i supposed to be good at snowball fights hermione said what have i got myself into dontworry ron grinned i ll go easy on you honey hermione hit ron over the head thinking how normal it felt for ron to call her honey as the trio left just over five minutes later the boys were assembled outside where on earth are the girls ron asked no one in particular bet they ve chickened dean said you wish erin daisy and hermione headed down the hill to where the boys were positioned they were appropriately dresses except for hermione daisy and erin both wore jeans and erin her trademark boots hermione on the other hand had opted for an extremely short skirt hermione ron exclaimed you cantwear that what do you mean hermione asked oblivious dontyou like it i know i like it seamus grinned and ron scowled at him you re going to freeze ron said looking genuinely worried and that coats only small here ron took off his coat and put it round hermione shoulders she smiled and her face was oddly red and harry was sure it wasntfrom the weather awww erin and daisy said ron realised what he was doing but didntmove away like he usually would have instead he put a hand to her cheek i wouldntwant you getting cold ron whispered sincerely and hermione was momentarily speechless so where ginny dean said breaking up the moment i dontknow hermione said she said she wouldntbe a minute hey called a sweet voice talk of the devil harry grinned ginny ran towards the group with an angelic smile on her face she d dressed appropriately wearing light jeans and a white coat brimmed with fur she was also wearing matching earmuffs and gloves so you finally turned up harry said with a new found confidence what do you mean ginny asked mockingly i fashionably late whatever dean said waving the conversation away lets start neville daisy bellowed at the top of her voice neville was strolling by the lake with a book in his hands when he spotted daisy he jogged over to the group hesitantly hi neville said as daisy pulled him into a friendly hug hey big bro daisy smiled i haventseen you all week it only wednesday daisy neville smiled fondly but still daisy pouted so what are you doing i actually came to find you neville explained professor sprout asked me if i d help you on an essay you were struggling with i thought we could work on it now since we have some spare time now daisy asked i just about to have a snowball fight cantwe do it later oh ok neville said disappointed maybe later neville why dontyou hang out with us for a while ron suggested you can join in the snowball fight now and do work later sure neville smiled but i not very good hey that not fair erin moaned now you have five on your team and we only have four the boys chuckled dontworry ginny said with a broad grin i think i ve just found someone else to be on our team who daisy asked ginny pointed to luna lovegood who was sitting reading on a bench not too far away loony luna dean asked perplexed are you sure completely sure ginny smiled then called hey luna do you want to join in our snowball fight luna looked shocked for a moment before calling back no thank you go on erin called we need another girl on our team please ginny called luna put down her book and made her way towards the group did you want me she asked in mysterious tones we re having a snowball fight hermione explained nicely we d really like it if you d join in oh of course luna smiled it would be my pleasure it settled then dean said let the games begin a n more winter fun god im gonna hav 2 start writing sum more u ppl are catchin up with me hope u enjoy this chapter angel chapter 18 childish mischief at midday the snowball fight was still in full swing the current champions were the boys even though harry kept letting the girls win dean and seamus took the game rather seriously and had no mercy on the other team seamus would make snowballs behind the hill while dean would attack and vice versa erin daisy and luna were putting up a very good fight they were much sneakier than the boys and had managed twice to sneak up on a boy and double team them ron and hermione were a different story it turned out that the snowball champion hermione granger had met her match she was living up to her reputation but ron was giving her a run for her money they were fighting one on one and harry wondered whether they knew the others were actually there or if they were wrapped up in their own little world ginny seemed to be targeting harry throughout the game but he supposed that was because he let her win whenever she threw a snowball at him harry would fall to the ground in a mocking manor or run away screaming ginny found it hilarious but the boys on his team werentquite as impressed neville wasntas skilled at snowball fights but he had fun none the less harry couldnthelp noticing how close he was to his sister neville had always been one to keep a distance from people yet him and daisy seemed as close as best friends they would make private jokes that only the other understood they would reminisce together about past experiences and laugh and they would never hesitate in taking sides with the other it was 10 minutes before lunchtime when the gang decided to make a verdict before they ate they teams trudged back to their bases suggested final tactics and made their last snowballs once all was decided they entered back into no man land dean passionately lead his team but found that the girls were nowhere in sight where are they dean asked i swear i could hear them over here a minute ago maybe they ow a single snowball hit dean on the shoulder he turned round but saw no one show yourselves ron called arrogantly several flying snowball pelted the team and the girls appeared from behind the boys stack of snowballs giggling hey that not fair seamus moaned they re our snowballs not anymore daisy grinned and the war was back in action snowballs were flying everywhere dean was chasing erin hermione was pelting ron luna and seamus were battling neville was being beaten by daisy and harry and ginny were unstoppable ginny was speedily tossing snowballs in harry direction and harry was nimbly ducking and sliding out of the way wontyou stand still ginny called in frustration as she threw her last snowball harry stopped still and caught in his hand the snowball which was heading straight for his nose i not the gryffindor seeker for nothing harry grinned things began to get hectic erin daisy and luna had attacked neville and he was laying buried in the snow they then turned to get seamus who lifted his hands above his head before he knew it the girls had taken him by the arms and were dragging him off sorry mate seamus called to dean you re on your own they re taking me as a hostage not that i mind seamus was easily dragged away so dean turned on ginny he threw a snowball at her stomach so harry threw three back at him what are you doing dean exclaimed wiping himself down you re on my team sorry harry said reflex the three girls returned armed with snowballs two down three to go erin grinned maliciously and the three girls charged at dean meanwhile ron and hermione vicious battle had turned into a playful game they were tossing snowballs at each other but had both lost the ability to aim snowballs were flying everywhere and one hit luna as the girls were passing by another one luna called dramatically pointing at ron oh no was all ron managed to say before he was knocked to the ground by snowballs ron hermione said as ron lifted himself up from the ground are you ok i fine ron said like a hero who had been at a deadly war are you ok yes hermione answered meekly just a little bit cold let me warm you up then ron smiled warmly and wrapped his arms around hermione hermione hesitated for a moment before wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head on his chest thinking about how open ron was suddenly being harry noticed and couldnthelp smiling he knew he d have to have a word with ron later something had to be said harry was knocked back to reality like a snowball had hit him on the head infact a snowball had hit him on the head and it had flown from ginny direction sweet arentthey ginny smiled walking to harry left side hmmm harry said uncertainly nodding his head she didntknow what he knew sometimes i wish i had someone to hold me like that ginny revealed staring mistily into the distance you ve got me harry grinned cheekily ginny smiled i know she said simply and threw another snowball at him that it harry grinned and began to tickle her sides harry tickled ginny to the ground and sat on top of her trying to hold her still ginny was kicking and laughing and harry was surprised at his own daring when he kissed her on the head surrender my sweet he grinned you wish ginny smiled and pushed harry over and straddled him hey help dean bellowed as loud as he could erin and daisy had double teamed dean and nobody was around to save him ouch dean called as a snowball hit him in the groin some help would be nice guys i buried neville called i cantmove i kind of busy right now harry said as ginny pinned down his arms i a hostage seamus called and i cantget past luna dontlook at me ron said as the others turned to him who would you choose out of dean and hermione the boys nodded their heads in agreement what dean called now what do i do you girls realize you haventwon until all the boys surrender we know daisy grinned then added to erin i think it time for plan b erin smiled and lifted up her t shirt in dean direction dean face was priceless it was a mixture of shock surprise and joy daisy quickly tackled dean to the ground and both girls sat on him i think we win erin grinned and gave daisy a hi five after the gang had collected their coats and belongings they headed back to the great hall for lunch lunch was much appreciated and eaten in large amounts with haste even hermione who had been watching her weight in this world filled her plate with a bit of everything several sandwiches later the gryffindors said goodbye to luna and neville and returned to their common room apon arrival dean and seamus engaged themselves in a conversation about quidditch and disappeared to their dorm room predictably ginny disappeared to find her followers much to erin dismay erin herself busied herself with a good book and a cup of hot chocolate and daisy went off to meet neville the trio on the other hand took the good seats by the fire and began a meaningless comforting conversation i think i d like to get married one day ron said midway through their talk sometime in the near future me too hermione sighed and have a family with lots of children really you dontseem the family type harry said examining hermione closely i think she does ron smiled i can see her with a band of small children giving them hugs and forcing them to read the boys laughed and hermione hit ron playfully on the arm what about you harry any plans for the future hermione asked cheerfully well if i live to be old enough i d love to get married and have a family harry said seriously but i wont get my hopes up not with voldemort around my main aim is just to make it till the end of the school year the atmosphere suddenly became tense i sorry harry hermione said apologetically i dontmean to bring it up i just forget that this isntour world i had until just now harry sighed lets talk about something else ron suggested like christmas no harry said plainly we need to discuss how to get home we cantjust hide in this world forever sooner or later i ve got to face my problems you re right hermione said so how are we getting home i dontknow ron said honestly i d say our best bet is just to tell dumbledore but after christmas harry added if that the only way to get home we ll have to wait till after christmas i really want to meet my parents sure hermione said softly we ll go back after christmas now i going to go and get a book you can never have too much knowledge hermione sprang from her chair and headed straight up the girls staircase bonkers that one ron grinned when hermione was out of earshot hmmm harry said unconvincingly something on your mind ron asked as he got up from his chair and positioned himself in hermione one next to harry kind of harry said and came straight out with it you and hermione you re getting rather close dontyou think are we ron asked guiltily yes harry said honestly you two are always hugging and stuff especially today has something changed well she is my pretend girlfriend ron said quickly nothing changed ron harry began raising his eyebrows do you like hermione of course i do ron said she been my best friend since forever no i mean like the way i liked cho harry said seriously no not like that of course not ron exclaimed going red in the face are you sure harry asked because you two you re different around each other at the moment i sure you no ron said there is absolutely nothing going on between me and hermione we re close i ll admit it but not like that we re just more huggy more huggy harry chuckled if you re sure harry said rolling his eyes i ve got my book hermione chirped appearing at the bottom of the girls staircase she walked over to the chair which she was previously seated in and found ron there that my seat she stated not anymore ron grinned but i was there first hermione said putting her book down but you left the chair ron argued the chair not the country ronald hermione exclaimed why dontyou take my seat ron asked because i want to sit back where i was sitting hermione explained well that just too bad ron sighed harry thought he was in for a big fight but was surprised to find he was wrong fine then i ll just have to sit on you hermione said and did just that hey ron argued with a smile on his lips no fair want to move yet hermione asked sitting round so she could see him no ron said stubbornly and crossed his arms harry a voice asked and it was erin s would you come with me for a walk to the kitchen s sure harry said glad to have a reason to escape the pair walked in silence until they were out of gryffindor tower so how life treating you erin asked casually as they strolled across the entrance hall ok harry said nodding his head not too bad quidditch practice is good a ball soon christmas on it way same here erin said but didntseem as bubbly as usual first match soon yea harry said should be an easy win though hmmm erin replied harry noticed that it was the same hmmm that he did when he was thinking they arrived at the kitchens and after being bombarded with house elves and stuffed with food headed back to the common room as harry picked at a strawberry tart he couldnthelp but feel bad dobby hadntbeen in the kitchens in this world harry had never tricked lucius into freeing dobby and it hurt harry to think of dobby still with the malfoy s not that lucius was alive in this world oddly enough winky was still there harry supposed she d got herself freed one way or another harry erin asked in an unusual tone like before how did you know that house elf name what oh winky harry chuckled we re old friends i thought i was the only one who visited the house elves erin said suspiciously but you re not the only one who goes to the kitchen s harry grinned taking a large bite of strawberry tart right erin said then went quiet which harry had learnt in his short time knowing her was something she never did it made harry suspicious anyway hermione goes to the kitchen sometimes harry said thinking of spew sometimes i go with her but you and hermione never used to get along well erin said pulling a thinking face things change harry said simply yea they do erin agreed then said in an undertone harry was sure he wasntmeant to hear more than you think i ve noticed ahhhhhhhhh review a n i love you guys casus belli has had 210 reviews now thank you so

thursday morning to find that it was heavily snowing again he wrapped his dressing gown around him and walked over to the window harry loved it when it snowed at hogwarts it made everything look so peaceful like a fairytale dean and seamus trooped into the room holding slices of warm buttered toast in their hands and chatting merrily to each other they dropped their school bags and sat on their beds no school today prongs dean grinned too much snow again but we cantgo out today seamus moaned something about a blizzard well we ll just have to make our own fun inside harry said cheerily why are you in such a good mood dean asked chucking his toast out of the open window i dontknow harry smiled it must be the snow i going to take a shower i ll meet you downstairs harry grabbed some underwear some jeans and a jumper and headed into the bathroom a shower and half a pot of gel later harry headed downstairs when he entered the common room harry found almost every person inside it huddling around the fire place giggling and laughing as it wasntcold in the common room harry figured it must be something else and he found out soon enough have you seen them prongs seamus asked grinning sorry harry said confused over here dean grinned and pulled harry through the crowd in the center of the group sitting on a large red settee were ron and hermione they were sitting in a similar position to how harry had left them the night before except that now they were sleeping in ron sleep he had wrapped his arms protectively around hermione who had somehow fallen asleep with her head in his lap even though they looked rather guilty harry knew they were innocent they were both sleeping peacefully yet with the commotion around them it was surprising that they hadntwoken up isntit sweet harry heard skye say to mitzi i wish i had a boyfriend like that me too mitzi said most boys only seem to have one thing on their mind and you usually give it to them a girl behind them said quietly this is such hot gossip lavender was telling parvati dramatically such gossip i know parvati grinned i wonder what her and ron were getting up to last night it obvious isntit lavender smirked lavender another girl squealed have you seen colin creevy he been taking photos of them no way misty lavender said yes way the girl misty replied does anyone want a photo colin asked enthusiastically for blackmail or a photo album why dontyou give them one when they wake up his brother dennis suggested i ll take one seamus grinned this opportunity is too good to pass up they re going to be so embarrassed when they wake up do you think someone should wake them a fifth year boy asked dean probably dean said not sounding too bothered let me have the honor harry said and made his way to the settee he shook ron and hermione gently and waited for signs of life as hermione stirred ron woke up too and wiped his eyes at almost the same second their eyes focused and they realized where they were and more importantly who was around them merlin ron exclaimed and the crowd laughed before clearing away why what time is it it time you two got up harry grinned two ron asked then looked down into his lap hermione wake up hermione had dropped off to sleep again but quickly woke up is it time to get up hermione murmured sleepily with her eyes half closed yes ron said we ve got lessons soon actually you haven t dean explained lessons have been cancelled padfoot great ron grinned before shaking hermione come on wake up i need to go and have a shower wake up ron shook hermione but it was too late she was back asleep again with her head resting in his lap once more what the matter with her padfoot dean asked she just tired ron said wiping the hair out of her face gently we were up pretty late last night oh really seamus grinned and ron went red not like that moony ron stuttered we had prefect duties that what they all say seamus mocked you cantdeny it we have evidence seamus presented ron with the photo colin had taken and ron smiled well i going to take hermione back to bed ron said standing up with hermione asleep in his arms but you canttake her up the girls staircase harry said you know what those stairs are like well she ll just have to sleep in our dorm ron said walking towards the stairs i not leaving her to sleep on the settee she ll get backache since when did he care so much dean asked as ron left no idea harry said not really listening to the question for a copper owl had just flown into the common room harry knew this owl it belonged to professor lupin he took the owl burden and it flew off again without a reply harry read the letter to himself harry your next lesson will be tomorrow come straight to my office after your last lesson see you then lupin harry screwed up the parchment and threw it onto the floor metting lupin for tea tomorrow harry lied seeing seamus and dean questioning faces you seem to be doing that a lot lately dean said suspiciously well he an older marauder isnthe harry said heading towards the boys staircase he got a lot he can teach us and i more than willing to learn with that harry legged it up the stairs and into his dorm room the room was silent except for the gentle sound of ron shower and hermione light breathing harry found hermione in ron bed and couldnthelp but think that she looked rather cute she was curled up under ron sheets and was blushing slightly harry was sure she d be blushing more when she woke up and realized where she was harry found the photo of ron and hermione sleeping laying innocently on ron bedside table harry smiled to himself he was sure that somehow that picture would make its way into ron photo album ron appeared from the bathroom and grabbed a comb off the floor dropped this ron smiled slipping the comb into his pocket is she still sleeping like a baby harry said as ron walked over to him she looks so peaceful ron said pulling the sheet up to hermione neck i couldntbring myself to wake her up dontblame you ron harry said looking at hermione well i going to have my shower ron announced i ll be right back as ron shut the bathroom door behind him hermione eyes opened what are you doing here hermione asked harry sleepily it my dorm room harry grinned do i have to have a reason what hermione questioned yawning but i m in ron bed harry replied walking over to the window he carried you upstairs you were asleep oh hermione said did we fall asleep in the common room again take a look for yourself harry grinned and pointed to the photo on ron bedside table hermione took a look at the photo and sighed we really need to stop doing that hermione stated people are going to start getting ideas you ve given them a pretty good reason to harry explained you two are all over each other are you sure you dontreally like ron as more than a friend oh my goodness of course i sure hermione exclaimed what a question i couldntpretend to go out with him if i was attracted to him that would be like taking advantage of him i would never do that to ron i guess not harry said feeling a little bit silly he d been sure there was something between his best friends yet what hermione said made perfect sense sorry for asking i was just sure that there was something never mind i just jumping to conclusions dontworry harry hermione smiled if something were to go on between me and ron you would be the first to know so you mean there is a chance something could happen between you two harry asked curiously i doubt it but then again you never know hermione said matter of factually someday he might stop being an insufferable git but i doubt that very much you re probably right harry grinned as ron entered the room ron obviously hadntbeen expecting hermione to be awake yet for he hadntbothered getting changed he was wearing a fluffy white towel around his waist his hair was damp and tousled and he was considerably wet when he noticed hermione he nearly dropped his towel in shock i didntthink you d be awake yet ron said blushing and holding tightly onto his towel obviously not hermione said staring at ron lack of clothes hermione expression made harry laugh her eyes were as large as saucers and she was biting her lip harry had never seen hermione like this before and he couldnthelp but find it humorous he was sure that if he asked her if she was attracted to ron again now he would get an entirely different answer ron seemed to have noticed hermione vague look for he suddenly turned red i didntwake you did i ron asked timidly searching for an outfit in his cupboard oh no hermione said tilting her head to one side staring unmistakably at ron chest i woke up myself good ron said choosing an outfit is it me or is it really hot in here hermione asked fanning herself with her hand and looking rather uncomfortable all of a sudden it you harry chuckled picking up a book it is a bit isntit ron said smiling slightly to himself ron took an outfit from his wardrobe and turned back to an awkward looking hermione do you mind he said and hermione squeaked before running out of the dormitory after ron was changed the marauder met up to discuss the days plan so prongs my main man what the plan for today dean asked as they strolled down the corridor we have a whole free day to do whatever we like you must have something in mind well first we need to eat harry announced so our first stop is the kitchens as for a prank hmmm cantyou think of one seamus asked you must be sick someone call a healer shut up moony harry said elbowing him in the ribs i ve got it fireworks we haventdone a good firework prank in ages sounds like a plan ron said and the others grinned in agreement when the marauders entered the kitchens they found that they werentthe first arrivals much to dean dismay erin dean exclaimed what are you doing here arenti allowed to visit the kitchens in my spare time erin asked innocently err no actually seamus said the kitchens are out of bounds whatever erin replied and stomped out of the kitchens what the matter with her seamus asked picking up an apple pie i dontknow harry said shaking his head never mind dean said in a voice that wasnthis own why dontwe talk about something other than erin yea like ball dates seamus grinned i ve decided to ask lavender if you re interested not really ron said eating some chocolate cake but you re going to tell us anyway right you are seamus replied and the other boys sighed i going to ask lavender later today i decided on her because she in our year and cause she the only girl i like who doesnthave a major crush on me i dontwant a girl dripping over me all night well i asking hermione ron announced as she my girlfriend i kind of have too dontlet her hear you saying that harry grinned so what about you harry seamus asked i still asking ginny harry said stubbornly and when she turns you down then who are you going to ask seamus chuckled she not going to turn me down harry said with no doubt in his mind i ve got a plan and she wontbe able to resist seamus and dean ooohed like little girls for a moment before bursting out into laughter so who are you asking dean ron asked casually and the laughter stopped i have selected my ball date dean said taking a swig of his butter beer but sadly i dontfeel the necessity to divulge such information oh come on dean ron sighed we all told you you ll know when the time is right dean said choosing himself a sandwich i ll tell you when i want to after a day of pranking and dinner the marauders headed back to the common room and took seats around the fire they sat silently for some time while their dinners went down before gentle conversation filled the air what a day ron sighed what a day you can say that again seamus said what a shut up padfoot harry moaned i too tired to listen to you talk rubbish alright then ron said lets talk about something else then seamus did you ask lavender to the ball whoops i knew i was supposed to do something seamus sighed where is she chatting over there dean said pointing to a group of giggling girls on their left oi lav seamus shouted and lavender turned her head wanna go to the ball with me sure she giggled then turned back to her friends one of which was approaching the marauders hi hermione smiled almost shyly i didntsee you over here come and sit down ron grinned motioning for hermione to sit next to him hermione walked round the chair and sat carefully next to ron harry noticed how uncomfortable hermione looked she wore the same unsettled expression she worn earlier in the morning when ron was wearing a towel ron either chose to ignore hermione expression or didntnotice for without hesitation he put an arm round hermione and pulled her close to him so where were we seamus said oh yea ball dates hermione ron asked turning to look her in the eyes will you go with me to the ball sure hermione said then relaxed a little i have to really i am your girlfriend the other boys sniggered but ron ignored them and pulled hermione closer to him right you are he said softly and planted a kiss on the top of her head so all we have left are dean and harry seamus grinned hello erin said quickly as she passed the group on her way to the girls staircase why dontyou come and join us harry asked her smiling i dontthink so erin muttered looking at her feet yea we were just discussing ball dates seamus grinned and it dean turn to tell oh really erin said with her eyes evilly on dean so wormtail seamus said you ve been very secretive about who you ve chosen as your date now your chance to spill who the lucky lady i dontknow dean muttered not meeting anyone eyes oh come on ron exclaimed i might have changed my mind dean said shrugging his shoulders just tell us seamus shouted please harry added yeah dean erin said with hurt in her voice why dontyou just tell them because i dontknow dean replied looking erin in the eye you seemed pretty sure this morning erin said in a sad voice before she run up the girls staircase harrysilently turned to face dean who simply shook his head in response review think of it as an early christmas giftr from you to me a n harry ginny chapter does mini hooray dance i going to post the next chapter tomorrow hopefully so that i can get all the christmas chapters up before christmas

as always angel chapter 20 the loop what is going on with you and erin seamus asked as they followed dean into the boys dormitory it none of your business dean said throwing his hands into the air in anger and walking to the window you ve upset my sister harry said taking a seat on his bed i think i have a right to know he got a point ron said sitting down with hermione i know if anyone was to upset my sister it d be the last thing they did ron gave harry a shifty look but harry ignored him wormtail just tell us harry said if not then we ll ask erin it as easy as that ok dean said turning to face the group it like this i wanted to ask erin to the ball i hinted to her that i d ask her to the ball i was really going to only i was worried that she d say no oh my god seamus sighed with his hand on his head you re a marauder girls always say yes but erin not just any girl dean said honestly she erin normal girl rules dontapply to her but why she so angry harry asked curiously there still plenty of time for you to ask her to the ball that the thing i thought i d speed up the process so dean said with his head down i flirted with skye right in front of her to make her jealous ouch hermione said biting her lip that was a bad move seamus said well it usually works girls usually come begging for me to ask them to the ball but not erin dean explained what am i supposed to do now apologize ron said simply i sure she ll forgive you hermione said resting her head on ron shoulder yea dean muttered walking to his bed maybe you re right can i ask you something harry said seriously and dean nodded his head do you really like erin yea dean said looking harry in the eye she really something well cool harry said nodding his head i glad you think so dean replied sincerely now i dontknow about you lot but i need some sleep yea seamus yawned time to turn in goodnight hermione said as she stood up from ron bed goodnight ron replied standing too he gave her a small hug and a kiss on the forehead before hermione left with a smile on her face goodnight everyone harry whispered before they all went off to sleep harry awoke the next morning to find dean bed empty and was informed by ron that dean had left early to make amends when entering the common room harry saw dean and erin sitting on a chair together in front of the fire talking it was at this moment that harry knew it was going to be ok there was something about the way that dean looked at erin that told him that she was in good hands monday and tuesday dribbled by with rain and sleet before wednesday brought a clear winter sky this was the day harry had been waiting for he only had double potions on wednesday morning so he knew that it was his last chance to put his plan into action harry wandered into the great hall for breakfast his mind in other places he found where ron and hermione were sitting and took a seat to the left of ron alright mate ron said as harry sat down pretty much harry said his eyes skimming gryffindor table for a certain red head dean and seamus arenthere they re pranking the defense rooms ron said misunderstanding who harry was looking for huh oh i not looking for them harry replied hastily erin in the library with daisy ron added again and harry was about to reply when hermione beat him too it ginny in the entrance hall hermione said simply a ravenclaw boy just took her out there i should imagine he asking her to the ball what harry exclaimed dontworry she ll turn him down hermione said half heartedly how do you know that ron asked hermione thickly because i in the loop hermione replied smiling sweetly the loop ron asked dumbly scratching his head yes ron the loop hermione replied well how come i not in it ron asked because you re a boy hermione said and an ignorant one at that at least i not rude ron said back raising his voice i think i d rather not be in the loop if it just full of people like you shhh harry hissed at the red faced pair people had started to look round at the argument between the schools favourite couple calm it you two she started it ron replied icily and hermione rolled her eyes i believe it was your nosiness that started it actually hermione replied harshly you two are supposed to be a couple remember harry said looking between them how can i forget ron muttered and hermione looked suddenly sad why dontwe head to lessons harry said eating the last of his breakfast lessons dontstart for 10 minutes ron said loading his plate with more food there no point hello a cheery voice sang as a pretty red head took a seat next to harry hi harry replied examining her her long cinnamon hair was down in wavy curls and was held in place with a forest green hair clip her deep brown eyes were bright lined with long brown eye lashes and shadowed with a hint of green harry had the sudden urge to ask her to the ball right then but resisted how are you all this morning ginny asked with a smile i ve been better ron grouched and hermione mumbled something in reply oh ginny said then turned to harry and you i good harry said nodding his head politely incase anyone interested michael corner just ask me to the ball ginny said taking a slice of toast from ron plate harry bowed his head so ron mumbled not trying to hide his bad mood i said no ginny said with a shrug of the shoulders he nice but he not my type how interesting ron yawned what is your type then harry couldntresist asking with a charming grin ginny looked him in the eye for a moment before deciding to reply tall handsome ginny began not breaking eye contact dark hair puppy dog eyes strong maybe a quidditch player really harry asked raising an eyebrow werentyou going somewhere harry ron drawled yea harry said breaking eye contact with ginny i ll see you later you will ginny asked i will harry said with a smile and bowed himself from the table minutes later harry found himself wandering absent mindedly into his potions room harry sirius grinned turning away from the blackboard he was writing on what brings you to my quarters lessons dontstart for another five minutes shouldntyou be pranking filch or chatting up girls or something well it about that harry explained perching on the edge of a desk see there this girl i want to ask to the ball ginny weasley sirius smiled yes and i need some time to sort something out harry explained your pulling something eh sirius barked kind of harry said twiddling his thumbs so would i be able to skip some of your lessons to sort it out sure harry sirius replied but first could i ask you one thing fire away harry said feeling more confident now what so special about this girl sirius asked seriously i mean i know miss ginevra weasley is one of the more attractive girls at hogwarts but why do you have to ask her she not the only pretty face at hogwarts but she not just a pretty face harry found himself saying but not really knowing where it was coming from look i dontknow there just something about her that what your father said about your mother sirius sighed he couldntdescribe it but he knew there was something special about her oh harry said going red well it not quite like that it tradition to ask her for one thing and i had a vision that what they all say sirius replied shaking his head as the ball rang now run along you can be as long as you need to be but make sure you make some sort of an appearance in my class dontwant people to think i favoring my godson no problem harry grinned and dashed out of the room harry made his way to the deserted entrance hall and stood in the center of it looking upwards he grinned it was all going to work out perfectly harry strolled into the potions room an hour and a half later with an innocent look on his face where have you been ron questioned thickly he was sitting at a desk at the back of the room and hermione was sulking beside him he been doing some work for me sirius said before harry could answer take a seat harry we re doing some revision at the moment so you ve not missed much harry took his regular seat next to ron and behind the other two marauders who were currently hexing a quill to leave the writers hands black you two still not made up yet harry grinned and the pair gave him identical poisoned looks which made harry chuckle you two are supposed to be hogwarts favorite couple people are starting to get suspicious ron shrugged his shoulders and hermione lifted her head maybe we should stage a break up hermione suggested that the best idea you ve had all day ron smiled no harry exclaimed you cantjust break up that would mess things up the old ron and hermione cantjust come back and find out they ve broken up but when the old harry comes back he going to find out that he went to the ball with ginny ron stated that a change too but that different harry argued the old harry asks ginny to the ball every year ron sighed and flicked over the page in his potions book harry hermione asked with a thinking face when the other ones of us come back they arentgoing to remember what has happened throughout the last few weeks they ll think they had amnesia harry said with a shrug of the shoulders then we could change things and it wouldntmake any difference hermione said if someone told them what we did they d just think they did it not if it was out of character harry replied he right hermione ron sighed the other ron and hermione would never break up they were glued together how d you know hermione asked ron whose ears went red i don t ron replied quickly ron hermione said in a warning voice tell us what you know i dunno ron said looking suddenly worried tell me hermione said finally well dontbe mad at me but i found a pensieve belonging to the other ron in my room a few days ago ron rambled looking down at his feet it doesnthave many memories in it but there are a few why didntyou tell us about it hermione stressed because ron mumbled looking from harry to hermione well it embarrassing the other ron and hermione are all mushy and stuff oh hermione said and harry sniggered well i still think we have a right to see it well if you really want to ron said closing his book we could go into all the memories sometime i mean i ve only been in one of them one was enough eh harry grinned something like that ron said seriously not meeting harry eyes well i guess we ought to pack up hermione said the bell going to go any minute what harry exclaimed i ve got to go harry rushed out of the room and down the corridor to the entrance hall he levitated himself to where he needed to be and waited patiently for the bell to ring the bell rang right on time and the halls suddenly flooded with students harry searched frantically for a red head among the crowd but ginny was nowhere to be seen harry was starting to worry that he d got ginny timetable muddled up when he spotted her over the other side of the entrance hall she waltzed gracefully through the crowd followed by her small group of admirers harry saw the other marauders and hermione enter from a corridor on the left and new it was time when ginny crossed the center of the hall harry dropped a long robe hanging from the ceiling to the floor at ginny feet the surrounding crowd suddenly went quiet as people looked up for the occupant of the robe harry pulled the invisibility cloak off himself and tossed it to one side dramatically a few girls squealed as they caught the discarded item and harry grinned as best he could harry took a deep breath before sliding down the robe like you would a fireman pole and landing a few steps away from ginny even though his hands were burning he put the thought from his mind and looked forward to ginny she had a pleasantly shocked look on her face and when she met harry eyes she smiled this was all the encouragement harry needed ginny will you go to the christmas ball with me harry asked and the crowd went silent ginny looked as if she was having a mental battle for a moment before meeting harry emerald green eyes she searched them for a moment before giggling yes i ll go with you review please a n just a quick note i wont be updating for a couple of days as im reeeealy busy sorry as for notes i was hoping that no1 would notice the cho cedric thing i didnt realise what id done untill after id posted it sorry and as for

chapter 21 harry grinned as he climbed the stairs to divination that was brilliant seamus said as he patted harry on the back genius dean said shaking his head how could she say no you know you ve started something now seamus smiled everyone suddenly started rushing around to get dates i glad we got out dates early else there wouldntbe any good girls left the boys climbed through the trap door and emerged in the divination room it seemed darker to harry than usual and the perfume was musty and filled the room like a fog the marauder took their usual seats as the rest of the class sauntered in you know what prongs i glad you asked ginny ron said putting his feet up on the table me too harry smiled i dontknow what the other harry was doing wrong that seemed almost too easy professor trelawney glided into the room and the class became quiet she took a seat behind her clattered desk and stared at the class through her insect like spectacles good day she said in her dreamy voice today we will be revising the art of dream reading now open your books to page 105 and read until the end of the chapter after that you can make a list of your last five dreams and read their meanings on page 145 but i must ask anyone who has dreamt of the alignment of the moon and sun not to look it up there are some futures which are best left untold harry chuckled as lavender and parvati started frantically flicking pages in their books no one else seemed to have taken any notice of trelawney warning and were slowly opening their books to the correct page and lulling their eyes over the text harry decided to follow suit and began to read well he tried to read but the words seemed to be jumbling themselves up he flicked over to the next page but it was as if the words were jumping up and down and swapping places with each other harry squinted at the page but the words wouldntstop moving and he gradually lost focus he was spinning in a dimly lit room he didntknow where as the world kept moving around him and he couldntkeep focused gradually his whereabouts came into view he was in the great hall and not alone there were hundreds of couples dancing around him spinning and twirling something hit harry he was holding someone hand are you alright harry ginny asked her voice sounded far away as if she was under water harry realized where he was the christmas ball he had one hand in hand with ginny s and his other hand he was sure was on ginny waist but he didntlook he didntbreak eye contact with her why dontyou sit down ginny suggested looking concerned she led him to one side of the hall and sat him on a chair you dontlook too well harry harry looked at the figures swimming around him but none came to his rescue i going to go to madame pomfrey ginny said taking harry hand harry noticed how small and cold her hands were but said nothing he seemed to have forgotten how to speak i ll be right back with something to help just sit there i ll be right back harry absent mindedly watched ginny exit the great hall before his stomach began to swirl everything inside of harry began to churn and he felt as if his body was trying to turn inside out his head lolled to one side as if it was too heavy for his body to carry his heart beat abnormally fast his eyes began to flicker a piercing scream made harry ears burn the room turned black the silence rung in harry ears he had to do something but his body was paralyzed the large doors swung open and light slithered into the room harry closed his eyes as he was blinded once more and uncontiousness closed the scene harry wake up mate harry opened his eyes to see the class crowding round him you alright ron asked with a large grin spread across his face you fell asleep and rolled off your chair harry suddenly realized that he was laying on the floor and a few girls giggled oooops harry grinned but his heart wasntin it no more fire whisky before class for me everyone seemed satisfied with harry answer and returned chatting to their desks what were you dreaming about ron asked pulling harry up from the ground you just mumbled something and threw yourself on the floor you wouldntbelieve me if i told you harry said rubbing his head try me ron replied trelawney gone off to make some more herbal tea so we ve got a while harry explained exactly what happened to ron who reacted in all the right places it was just like that other vision harry explained where me and ginny were dancing at the ball except this time i was actually there and the scream ron asked wearily are you sure it was ginny yes harry replied lightly i couldntsee her but i just know it was mr potter said the mystic tones of professor trelawney oh no she back ron murmured i hear that you had a vision while i was away trelawney said dramatically of course i knew you would which is why i left sometimes the seeing eye can err collide with such visions causing them to be fragmented i think her brains been fragmented harry heard dean whisper from the table in front now mr potter would you care to tell the class what you saw in your dream trelawney charmed err no actually harry replied confidently and lavender and parvati gasped but you must tell us trelawney insisted you have been sent this vision now because it is meant to be shared it was just a dream harry said honestly as a bead of sweat ran down his face probably about ginny seamus chuckled and gave harry a wink as a matter of fact it was harry replied with an idea ron gave him an urgent look and harry kicked him from under the table well do tell us trelawney grinned looking sure that she had won ok if you really want to hear it harry told the class then said to ron i d cover your ears if i were you ohh dean grinned before harry began so it started like this harry smiled i was walking in the woods deep in the woods and i came across this clearing it was a field covered with wild flowers and in the middle of it was this large waterfall now swimming in the middle of this beautiful waterfall was a pretty redhead what was she wearing seamus asked grinning she was wearing a white string bikini top tight denim shorts and a while lily in her hair harry said and some of the boys in the class grinned now she swam over to me and climbed out of the water she flicked her hair and smiled at me then i asked her how do you get into those shorts she stepped closer to me and ran her hands up my bare chest and it was the that i realized that i wasntwearing any clothes the whole class laughed but harry carried on anyway so i was a bit shocked to say the least harry said raising an eyebrow in an amusing manor but anyway i said to her how do you get into those shorts then she replied you can come for a swim for a start everyone laughed again and the bell rang that was when you woke me up harry grinned as he picked up his bag well that was quite a vision trelawney said looking taken aback i suggest that you go to the hospital wing i believe that that fall may have done damage to your brain go see you later harry said to the other marauders and headed in the direction of the hospital wing a n ohhhhh i love this chapter thank you for the reviews i do read them as for reviewers someone made a suggestion and description of a pre ball hogsmeade trip which is weird as i already had a very similar idea i ve only written two more chapters after this one so suggesions for future chapters will be read and taken into account i love to hear your ideas anyways enjoy this chapter angel chapter 22 beauty and boggarts harry never made it to the hospital wing as on his way over he happened to pass lupin down the corridor what are you doing out of lessons harry lupin asked curiously professor trelawny sent me to the hospital wing harry revealed not that i sick of anything she just jumps to conclusions i get the impression that she thinks i have a brain tumor lupin laughed wisely as he locked the door to his office with his wand are you prepared for today lesson lupin asked pocketing his wand i hope you ve had enough sleep i ll be working you hard today i fine harry said honestly better than fine that great to hear lupin smiled now i must be going i ve got to pop to the library before i have a meeting with a student see you later harry said as he headed in the opposite direction a minute or so of walking later harry passed ginny down the very same corridor she looked as beautiful as she had earlier on with the addition of a smile harry wasntsure how to speak to ginny since he d asked her to the ball she was his date but also just his friend mind you harry was sure you werentsupposed to notice how beautiful your friends were or what long legs they had as ginny approached harry wondered if anything had changed he was just thinking of what to say to her when she spoke hi harry ginny smiled hello harry replied bunking are we ginevra no ginny said simply i have a place to be you on the other hand appear to be bunking if you ask me i hurt harry said with a hand on his heart hurt that you would assume that if i was bunking i wouldntbe doing it alone would i good point ginny said and rolled her eyes so what calls you to the corridor i just happen to be walking down on my way to the hospital wing to get my brain checked out harry explained trelawney thinks i ve lost it she one to talk ginny muttered i know harry said but i under strict orders to have my head scanned i mad and dangerous so i d watch it if i were you anger me and i could turn on you at any moment very funny ginny smiled i never thought i d say this but there nothing wrong with your head it very nice i know harry said preening ginny slapped harry over the head and harry responded by tickling her sides hey ginny giggled get off say you re sorry harry grinned tickling ginny as she backed weakly into the wall never she replied dramatically between laughs then face the consequences harry roared and threw ginny over his shoulder by her waist put me down ginny exclaimed my skirts going everywhere indeed it was on harry left shoulder was ginny weasley bottom which was being covered by nothing but teddy bear knickers they were baby pink with childish frills and had a pattern of smiling teddy bears oh my harry said with a chuckle what this teddy bear knickers after all the rumors i hear about you wearing sexy underwear i find that you wear granny knickers oh shut up and put me down ginny ordered i think i might have to tell some people about this harry laughed no you won t ginny said sternly you re going to not tell anyone and put me down before all the blood rushes to my head first say you re sorry harry said childishly and that i very handsome you re absolutely gorgeous now put me down ginny ordered harry lifted a sulking ginny down to the floor she crossed her arms and leant on the wall with her bottom lip pouting out neither of them spoke for a moment just stood eyeing each other out you know i think your teddy bear knickers are cute really harry said as seriously as he could ginny couldntkeep a straight face any longer but you do realize harry continued that from now on i going to have to check what underwear you re wearing every day to make sure this doesnthappen again oh ok ginny sighed with a small smile harry watched the grin play across her lips for a moment before realizing that he was staring he then raised his eye line to look into ginny eyes and found that she was staring into his her eyes were the deepest chocolate brown and harry found that he couldnttear his eyes away from them i really glad you asked me to the ball harry ginny said sincerely i wasntplanning on going until you asked really harry said in a lower voice than he planned why well there wasntanyone i really wanted to go with ginny replied and harry could see deep emotion in her eyes boys always ask me just because of who i am not because they like me i didntjust want to go with some random boy i ve asked you before harry said thinking back to previous conversations why d you always say no i dontknow ginny said honestly after a short pause i wish i didn t what were you going to do on the night of the ball harry asked stay in the common room alone while everyone else was having fun no ginny replied in a small voice i was going to help professor riddle with a few jobs he said he was going to be busy that evening and asked me if i would why would he be busy on the night of the christmas ball harry asked edgily i dontknow ginny replied sounding a little uneasy harry put his hands on ginny upper arms comfortingly you know if there anything you want to tell me i always here for you harry said in earnest i know ginny sighed it just difficult if only you knew footsteps interrupted the pairs conversation and harry turned to find lupin pacing down the corridor i suggest you two go where you re meant to be lupin warned there no wandering round the corridors and you know that harry gave ginny a sympathetic look before letting her walk off in the opposite direction to himself harry never made it to the hospital wing but instead sat outside the great hall waiting for the lunch bell to ring when it did ring he was the first one to enter and sat himself right in the center of the table soon he was surrounded by fellow gryffindors including the marauders erin daisy and hermione i told him that i already had a date erin rambled sometime in the middle of lunch he just wouldnthave it justin is a pain daisy said pouring some pumpkin juice but he should be able to get it it not rocket science what ron asked dumbly never mind daisy said rolling her eyes you really ought to take muggle studies you sound like hermione ron grumbled talking of hermione erin said haventyou been out with justin have i hermione asked going red indeed daisy replied in your 4th year oh yeah hermione murmured looking down at her plate if you want i could just hex him dean said casually he d be sure to leave you alone after that you are her date seamus added which gives you the right to hex him dontworry erin grinned he ll get it eventually are you alright mate ron asked harry you seem rather quiet i fine harry smiled just tired with all that not going to lessons i ve been doing sounds about right seamus grinned towards the end of lunch harry ron and hermione were left alone not long till the christmas holidays harry said with a distant smile yea ron said should be nice seeing as i rich i should be receiving some pretty nice gifts that not all christmas is about hermione said sternly it about being with the ones you love well we re doing that too arentwe ron argued you guys are coming over mine on christmas eve and you two and ginny came come over mine whenever you like harry added brightly you can meet my parents and see my house hermione smiled fondly at harry of course she said admiringly now ron what are you doing later why d you ask ron said unsurely because we still haventseen your pensieve hermione reminded ron who sighed did you think i d forgotten not really ron moaned figured you were biding your time great hermione chirped then we ll check it out tonight not tonight ron said quickly i busy how about tomorrow night oh ok hermione agreed as she rose from the table tomorrow night it is hermione tossed her rucksack over her shoulder and exited the hall what so bad that you dontwant hermione see harry asked ron curiously ron just shook his head what are you worried about harry asked i mean how bad can it be at the worst it memories of you are hermione snogging it not that ron sighed it just that hermione going to get all weirded out you think so harry asked a little confused it freaked me out for a while ron added made me think and you know that never good hmmm harry mumbled it changed the way i felt ron stuttered made you see hermione in a different light harry asked raising a cheeky eyebrow not like that ron exclaimed just you ll see wait till tomorrow evening after lunch harry and ron made their way to their next lesson defense against the dark arts although it was harry favorite subject the fact that it was with his least favorite teacher made it hard to enjoy the lesson the class ambled in and found snape standing in front of his desk holding a large box smirking it turned out that they were to be revising boggarts and snape looked like christmas had come early apparently watching his class in total fear was one of snape favorite pastimes he took delight in the petrified look on some of the students faces as he explained the task snape seemed to take the weakest students first few of who could resist the boggart he simply cackled as lavender brown shriveled into the floor crying halfway through the lesson get up miss brown snape sneered in disgust you now mr weasley this should be interesting ron walked forward to the front of the class and was not confronted with what he was expecting to see there standing right in front of him was hermione ron said the boggart hermione in a crackly voice ron i dying you ve got to help me tears ran down her soft pale cheeks as she cradled her stomach a stomach which was covered in blood ron stood transfixed for a moment his eyes wide and worried riddikulus ron called as strongly as he could the boggart now changed form and ron found harry standing before him ron harry croacked with his hands round his bleeding neck please mate you ve got to run before it too late dontworry about me r riddikulus ron shouted louder the boggart changed again the time to the form of ginny help me ginny sobbed please get some help ginny then placed her hands over her mouth and began to cough when she moved her hands away they were covered in blood make it stop ron ginny pleaded please make it stop r riddikulas ron stammered once more hermione appeared again and the whole class gasped she stood in the center of the classroom looking horrifically worse than before her whole body was covered with deep dirty scars her clothes were slashed wet and covered with dirt her hair sat in muddy clumps above the gash which covered her forehead blood dripped down between her tired dull eyes and down her pale white face ron she whispered though her lips barely moved i got away i finally got away she took a staggering step towards ron who stood frozen to the floor i didntthink i d make it she whispered again as silent tears rolled down her cheeks ron i dying they took me and they hurt me and now it too late i sorry ron it too late ron stood still watching hermione sob chilling tears down her cheeks harry thought he was about to break when he raised his wand again riddikulus ron shouted strongly through the silence hermione changed her clothes repaired themselves and her hair became neat and clean her scars melted away and she stood there smiling at him hey she said simply and ron stepped away close friends and family dying snape sneered all the spiders lost their legs ron walked away without a word his face pale beneath his powdered freckles as snape called up his next victim ron wiped his face with the sleeve of his robes and looked despondently ahead of him ron looked more shaken then harry had seen in a long time which gave him an aching pain in the pit of his stomach hermione tapped him sadly on the shoulder and ron turned round to be enveloped in a comforting hug miss granger snape scorned if you can detangle yourself from mr weasley for a few minutes perhaps you can join in the lesson like the rest of the class hermione looked calmly at snape who rolled his eyes in dislike at her go he said simply pointing to the front of the room as hermione reached the pile of bandages which was once a mummy it changed into something so simple yet meaningful sitting at hermione feet was a gravestone it looked rather plain and the surrounding class barely battered an eyelid hermione stood as still as a statue her hands pulled into shaking fists tears threatening to escape she let out a small sob as her breathing became harsh the class couldntunderstand what was so wrong and it seemed that neither could snape get on with it he drawled crossing his arms hermione just stood still her face cold with fear slowly everyone began to creep closer to hermione until they could read the contents of the gravestone hermione jane granger in memory of her hard work and how she lived her life to the fullest may she rest in peace as the war continues hermione ron whispered and she broke out of her trance riddikulus hermione murmured lamely yet it was enough to make the gravestone crumble to the ground afraid of death are we miss granger snape taunted with a smirk afraid that you might not have lived life to the fullest or do you have things left unsaid hermione ignored snape and hid at the back of the classroom the gits right hermione sighed when ron and harry joined her i haventlived my life and what would happen if i died before the war had ended i wouldntbe there to help snape made his way through the rest of the class until only harry remained he had a sinking feeling that snape was going to do that he wouldntbe worried except that he had no idea what to expect mr potter snape smirked lets see what you re most afraid of is it loosing your love life or your head growing so big that it doesntfit out of the door a few people sniggered but quickly turned their laughs into coughs harry wandered purposefully to the front of the class and waited before him floating in midair was a crystal ball it very much resembled the one trelawney kept on her desk and harry wondered for a moment what there was to be afraid of as he stared into it foggy depths shadows filled the glass orb shadows of fires deaths crumbling buildings shadows of people fighting for their lives shadows of the dark mark harry could almost hear the screams if he d cared to look round he would have seen the look of confusion on the other students faces they couldntsee what he did and he knew it harry didnttake his eyes off of the orb though even when he raised his wand riddikulus harry stated and the orb dropped to the floor and smashed interesting snape said without his usual spitefulness what mr potter fears more than anything is the future the bell rang class dismissed a n not as interesting

adding me to that c2 community it pretty cool i going to have to read all the stories in it chapter 23 changes the trio walked silently out of defense against the dark arts and wondered almost aimlessly to gryffindor tower when they reached the fat lady hermione stopped dead still ron she said turning to face him do you mind if i change the password as the 7th year prefects that was ron and hermione duty no course not ron replied glumly with his hands in his pockets why a new password for a new start hermione replied strictly then turned to the fat lady could you change the password to carpe diem first thing tomorrow as you wish the fat lady said what does carpe diem mean harry asked hermione simply he knew not to expect a long explanation hermione didntappear to be in the mood infact the trio appeared to have a small black cloud following them around it latin hermione replied it means seize the day which is exactly what i going to start doing when we get back to our world things are going to be difficult and i wouldntlike to die knowing that i never lived life you arentgoing to start do mad things are you ron asked raising an eyebrow like jumping off of cliffs and things no hermione said with amusement in her voice but not meeting his eyes i just mean that i going to start start taking chances first of all i going to start doing homework the night before it due who are you and what have you done with hermione ron asked dramatically shaking hermione shoulders hermione smiled with warmth and laughed come on you fool she grinned and turned to the fat lady elf rights the portrait door swung open and the trio climbed inside feeling a little better than before the common room was filled with friendly chatter and harry was just about to sit down when he remembered something shit harry cursed i supposed to meet lupin i ve got to go harry legged it from the common room out of gryffindor tower and only slowed down his pace when he met the corridor leading to lupin office he stood still for a moment and bent over breathing hard you alright there a familiar voice asked harry stood up to be face to face with a grinning ginny weasely yeah harry replied automatically except for the fact that i just ran through half of the castle ginny giggled brightly where are going in such a rush ginny asked amusement playing in her eyes to meet professor lupin harry answered deciding that it would be safe need to discuss homework same here ginny replied quickly her face reflecting her good mood i ve just left his office oh well i d better go harry said walking past before turning back on himself ginny can i ask you a personal question sure ginny said intensely though she didntlook very sure fire away what does a bogart turn into when you stand in front of it harry asked tensely i mean what do you see myself ginny replied sadly in a small but familiar voice a voice which reminded harry very much of a younger ginny a younger ginny in the chamber of secrets right harry replied thinking thanks ginny turned with a flick of golden hair and harry was left immobilized he watched her walk away for a moment before finishing his journey hello harry lupin smiled when harry strolled into his office ready to go ready when you are harry replied firmly and followed the older man out of his office after an hour of practicing harry felt invincible he hadntyet reached a particular animal form but he wasnttoo worried now change your face again lupin said with his eyes twinkling and his hand scratching his chin your eyes harry scrunched up his eyes and when he opened them they were blue brilliant lupin complimented and harry changed back now your legs make them shorter harry obliged and fell to the floor laughing ok lupin smiled now i want you to change your arms and legs at the same time harry had never done this before and was a little hesitant harry thoughts must have shown on his face too dontworry lupin hushed helping harry to his feet you can do this arms and legs harry clenched his teeth and concentrated so much that his face went red no no stop lupin said waving his hands you re thinking not feeling i trying harry sighed leaning against the wall that the problem lupin said taking a seat on a nearby desk tell me what you re trying to do i thinking hard about changing and the molecules in my body moving harry said honestly and then i just wait till it happens you re anticipating the change lupin growled exactly what i was trying to avoid your father always anticipated the change and it took him months to get over it lupin put his head in his hands and harry asked the question which was most troubling him remus harry asked in a child voice when will i start changing into an animal lupin raised his eye line when you re ready lupin said wisely when you ve mastered other things we ll start to cover it i afraid it going to be a long while before we get there though it took the marauders the better part of their years at hogwarts to fully master it it takes most wizards no less than 6 years of hard work but i not them harry replied stubbornly i not most wizards you have to be in the right frame of mind to transform lupin explained rubbing his eyes you have to be mature and you have to have a reason the other marauders did it to help me they knew i urgently needed someone to transform with and they came to my aid i have a reason harry said passionately i know it took them a long time before they reached the stage where they could transform but i not like them these exercises dontinterest me and i only have my animal transformation on my mind you want to try and transform lupin asked with his eyes lighting up yes harry said will you help me i wouldntusually but today has been as unexpected as it could possibly be lupin stated standing up harry grinned i dontthink anything would surprise me right now lets give it a go lupin stood bang in front of harry now i want you to clear your mind he continued i want you to concentrate on your actions but i want you to feel them ok harry whispered with his eyes closed i want you to feel that little bit inside of you that little bit that wants to come out lupin recited that thing which makes you you harry do you know what your patronus is a stag harry answered clearly of course lupin whispered almost to himself now it all up to you you ve got to feel the movement and make it happen i dontexpect you to do it harry understand this i will do it harry chanted with his eyes still closed good lupin said in a comforting voice just breathe and let it go let everything melt away think of the things i said when we talked about animals think of the way they move make it happen harry almost unexpectedly began to change he changed rapidly and strongly from the bottom upwards it stopped at harry waist when harry decided to open his eyes and found that the body below wasnthis harry panicked and changed sharply back falling tiredly top the floor brilliant lupin cheered i dontbelieve it this is impossible harry dontforget how that felt we re going to go right back to that next lesson no harry argued pulling himself to his feet i trying again i know what it is i have to do now harry closed his eyes and when he opened them again he knew that he had done it for one thing there was the look of utter astonishment on lupin face then there was the way harry felt free his mind was his but it was different wild harry took a look in the reflection of the classroom windows he was a stag harry lupin said grinning proudly you have really outdone yourself harry changed back to himself and took the compliment with a grin i didntthink it was physically possible lupin said shaking his head the little time we ve had it guess the only thing that matters is what you have in here lupin pointed to his heart with a fist i so proud of you my second student to transform this year what harry asked squinting you mean i not your only student no you re one of three lupin replied fatherly and the second to transform today infact i was most surprised when a student made a transformation earlier and now i quite shocked to say the least your fathers going to be so proud it took him years to transform who are your other students harry asked as lupin opened the door i afraid i canttell you lupin said it not my place to how did you chose them harry asked i didn t lupin replied simply dumbledore did and he chose them on potential and it turns out that he chose right review and make sure you check for the next chapter 2moro a

stairs and trampled lazily into the common room they positioned themselves in the appropriate arm chairs and lolled their heads on their shoulders wakey wakey rise and shine hermione cheered as she took a chair opposite harry come on wake up lessons start in twenty minutes the boys grumbled in unison and hermione sighed boys she muttered to herself tell me about it said erin friendly voice as she appeared from around the corner dean told me he d meet me for breakfast and he didntshow up he still in bed ron mumbled i gathered that erin replied morning all daisy exclaimed and the boys grumbled once more well someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed we were up late doing quidditch practice harry explained we stayed out a whole three hours after you girls left well that your choice erin mused but still enough of the moaning daisy demanded have any of you read the notice it hogsmeade this weekend at last erin smiled a chance to go out and buy everyone christmas presents you mean a chance to buy more sweets dean said as he strolled next to erin sorry i didntmeet you for breakfast i slept in it doesntmatter erin lied blushing walk me to class dean led erin away without a goodbye bye erin daisy said sarcastically it as if she just forgot we were all here that love for you ron mused talking of love lets go get some breakfast hermione there no time hermione argued crossing her arms lessons are about to start oh go on ron begged using his best puppy dog eyes i will if you promise to show me that pensieve tonight hermione decided deal ron said finally but not looking to sure before he led hermione away what pensieve daisy asked never mind harry said waving the question away with his hand it time for class i ve got to go at the end of the school day harry was in a much better mood than the one he d woken up in even though christmas had never been his favorite time of year he could slowly feel the christmas spirit getting to him he d received his first christmas card of the year from a random 3rd year he didntknow had his first mouthful of mince pie of the year he d taken a visit to the kitchens and had his first glimpse of this years christmas decorations in filch office harry took his good mood with him to the common room and even managed to have a pleasant conversation with erin about house elf rights so if everyone would just donate a small amount to the elf rights organization everyone could have a house elf with holiday and pay erin explained in a high pitched passionate voice it a good idea erin harry grinned but i dontthink it would go down to well with wizards who have house elves for free erin sat thinking for a moment flicking through the pages of her elf rights book she reminded him so much of hermione what do you want for christmas harry asked smiling it was a nice feeling having a sibling to buy for nothing erin said simply there nothing i want there must be something harry said nothing erin repeated what about you what do you want harry tried to think of something but nothing sprang to mind he didntwant anything material for christmas just time with his family i cantthink of anything harry admitted see it not so easy erin joked and went back to reading her book harry peered over her shoulder and read the page too it was a list of elves names and quotes of what they d said on the subject of freedom harry was amused to see that they were all against freedom pay and holiday erin harry exclaimed as a thought popped into his head ive just had a great idea what erin asked closing her book sharply how about instead of buying christmas presents for each other we buy some for the house elves harry suggested i mean it would be a nice idea we could buy them some decorations for the kitchen or some books that a great idea harry erin grinned i ve got to go tell the house elves no donttell them harry laughed let it be a surprise oh ok i ll just tell dusty she ll know what everyone will like and is great at keeping secrets erin explained standing up this is brilliant what gave you such a good idea you re not normally so selfless at christmas yes i am harry argued and erin gave him a funny look i am now right erin said looking shifty look i ve got to go hey erin hermione smiled as she took a seat opposite harry are you alright you look like you ve just seen a ghost i wish erin muttered and swiftly left the common room what up with her hermione asked no idea harry replied so what brings you back to the common room i thought you were in the library i was hermione stated but then lav and pav came in distracting me about tacky dress robes and ron somehow escaped he still doesntwant to show me that penseive and now i ve lost him harry chuckled you donthave quidditch practice tonight do you hermione asked and harry shook his head ron is insufferable he told me you did and that he d have no time never mind why dontwe head to dinner harry suggested ron must be there he never misses a meal harry and hermione ate dinner in the great hall but to hermione annoyance ron was nowhere to be seen i dontget it hermione sulked as they left the great hall an hour later where can he be have you lost padfoot hermione seamus asked pouting mockingly as a matter of fact i have hermione said have you seen him nope dean replied but we re heading to snape office we ll let you know if we find him there dean and seamus wondered off pulling fireworks out of their pockets harry sniggered wondering what they were up to so you think it funny hermione asked harry crossing her arms why canthe just be mature about it we need to see this pensieve you just cantstand not knowing something can you hermione harry mused and hermione shrugged well i suppose and it is about me so hermione tailed off heya ginny smiled approaching harry and hermione harry was surprised for a moment as ginny never approached them without her crowd of admirers hi harry replied smiling are you two going to hogsmeade at the weekend ginny asked politely of course hermione replied naturally i still have to get my dress robes me too ginny said why dontwe go together i need some help choosing and i know you have great taste sounds great hermione said with enthusiasm their conversation almost reminded harry of the way they used to talk in the other world before harry knew it the girls had turned off down a corner with a girly good bye and left harry quite alone harry found his legs carrying him off in a random direction not quite knowing where he was being lead after a few minutes of walking and thinking harry arrived at the end of a corridor facing a door with a stain glass window harry put his hand on the door knob thinking admiringly of hogwarts and it many undiscovered passages and opened the door behind the door was the herb garden which had always been out of bounds to students harry took a few steps outside and breathed in the evening air before strolling over to the gate it was winding and metal and reflected the inky purple sky almost perfectly harry brought out his wand to undo the lock but no spell would work after a few minutes of contemplation harry wandered over to the left of the garden which lead right into the forbidden forest harry put his wand away an idea suddenly sparking in his head he picked a star to spot and changed almost effortlessly into a stag he raged through the forest the moss slipping at his hooves he took laps around the pathways and leapt over the green before his human instincts kicked in and he began to try to find the quickest way out of course that easier said then done harry trotted hopelessly in circles before a noise made him stop it was the swishing of a cloak harry knew it was he recognized it shadowed against the hooting of owls and the whistling of the wind yet harry knew he must be wrong he took a few more steps before hearing it again it was unmistakable harry wasntthe only wizard in the forest harry ducked down as the swishing got louder but kept his eyes on the dimly lit pathway a long shadow danced across it at walking pace and within seconds was gone harry felt a shiver run down his spine and suddenly felt his stomach turn before he knew it he was changing back to himself harry stood up righting himself and wiped his muddy hands on his robes before running to the path and in the opposite direction of the shadow harry knew that being alone in the forbidden forest as a human wasntsafe and luckily found his way out of the forest unnoticed once back inside harry traipsed up to gryffindor tower and straight into the common room he took off his robes which were drenched with cold sweat and threw them onto a table before running over to hermione wanting to tell her what had happened where is he hermione asked harry in an accusing tone harry looked blankly at her ron where is he donttell me you haventseen him sorry hermione harry said falling into a chair his mind now on hermione latest problem i haventseen him he been gone for hours i know hermione said softly sitting down fidgeting with her skirt do you think he avoiding me avoiding his fake girlfriend harry said as jokily as he could now why would he do that maybe because he doesntwant to change things a low voice said behind them ron emerged from the boys staircase and strolled slowly round harry chair with a pensieve in his hands his head was hung sadly as he placed it upon the table and knelt down beside it now i only doing this because you ll never let it go if i don t ron said generally but it was obviously aimed at hermione she looked eagerly over at harry who nodded his head and they both got closer i didntwant you guys to see this and i still don t ron explained swirling round the memories with his finger what can be so bad about your memories hermione asked ron interrupting him from his speech look ron said turning to hermione these memories weirded me out a bit and i dontwant them to do the same to you i like things just the way they are me too hermione said honestly putting a hand on ron lower back but i cantsee what difference memories can make you d be surprised ron said going back to the pensieve they made a difference to me so they re bound to make a difference to you i just hope they dontmake a bad difference i like you as my fake girlfriend and my best friend i dontreally want to loose you as either it wont change anything ron harry assured him it will ron argued emotionlessly i just hope this all works out well it will hermione assured him as all three put their fingers on the edge of the bowl i doing this for you hermione ron said looking her seriously in the eyes promise me you ll think about this hermione nodded and on the count of three harry ron and hermione dabbed their fingers into the pool of swirling colour and time and were lifted back to a past they didntremember come on people review we ve nearly reached 300 a n christ on a bike how many reviews 353 thats

the story now enjoy this chapter all my love angel chapter 25 memories the trio fell soundlessly to the floor landing expertly on their feet they were outside in the hogwarts grounds and it was a bright and busy day students were chatting left right and center and rushing around sharing news harry knew hogwarts was only this busy at one time of year the first week back at school ron lead the other two to the center of the path and hermione tugged ron on his sleeve dontyou think we should be hiding hermione said sounding panicked if someone notices who we are it alright hermione harry reassured her they cantsee or hear us why do i get the feeling you ve done this before hermione asked raising an eyebrow but harry was too busy watching a loud group of students to notice a first year harry ron seamus and dean were moving merrily in the trio direction leader of the pack was harry with his messy hair and ron strolled confidently by his side seamus and dean took up the back pee shooting passers by there was a noticeable difference between the young harry and ron and the ron and harry who were watching it almost aggravated harry to see his other self stroll in such a cocky manor with his hand placed conveniently in his pockets ron on the other hand didnteven falter as his younger self threw a stone at two hufflepuff boys nice day for a prank young harry announced as he brought a bag of dung bombs out of his pocket the other boys giggles childishly good idea dean chirped in a voice about two octaves higher than usual we should chuck them in filch office no lets throw them at snape seamus argued i found a great passage way by his office the other day so he d never catch us lets do it after dinner i can t the younger ron sighed i have to write to my sister she wrote yesterday and she gets whiney if i dontreply i ll write to your sister young harry said heroically now lets get ready for this prank it going to be the best one hogwarts has ever seen so can we throw them at snape harry seamus asked sure young harry replied grinning and i know just the thing to help us do it unnoticed seamus the trio followed young ron as he took his best friend to one side harry was wondering why they had called seamus seamus before figuring out that this memory must be from before the young marauders existed harry young ron started thanks for covering for me but i really do need to write to me sister she misses me now that she the only kid left at home it ok harry said patting his friend on the shoulder i said i d write to her canthave too many girl friends now can you i have to write to my sister anyway thanks young ron smiled genuinely that the nicest thing who that the trio followed young ron gaze down to a figure sitting by the lake she had brown curly hair and a book resting in her lap that hermione granger harry said smartly she in our house and year why do you like her or something no ron replied bluntly i dontlike girls ok then harry said rolling his eyes lets go back to the castle as the two young boys turned away harry eyes lingered on the younger hermione as she turned her head she stared at ron for a moment then shook her head and went back to her reading the scene suddenly melted and harry felt a jerk on the back of his robes as he was thrown into another landscape this time he was in the library a slightly older looking hermione maybe in her 4th year sat behind a battered desk her hair was longer then before and half tied back with a pink ribbon and her figure showed maturity her eyes scanned over a dusty old volume and she didnteven notice when a boy appeared in front of her hermione ron asked with a slightly nervous smile on his face he pulled the book she was reading down from her face and was met with a frown do you mind hermione asked sternly sorry ron said hesitating slightly but i was wondering if you wanted to go to hogsmeade with me hermione face suddenly lit up yes i d love to she smiled great ron said i ll meet you in the common room at 9 ron gave hermione a cheesy grin before wondering off to the back of the library the trio followed him lead by ron and saw him tell his friends she said yes young ron cheered and harry gave him a high five brilliant padfoot dean applauded was there ever any doubt ron asked the trio then drifted back to hermione who now had lavender and parvati at either side that so cool lavender gossiped i dontbelieve you re going out with a marauder and a quidditch player parvati added ushering hermione out of the library now we have to tell everyone the scene changed again drip by drip to that of an empty astronomy tower there was a blanket in the middle of the floor and some cushions but not a person in sight ron stood unsettlingly still looking out of the window as if somebody was about to climb through it what happening harry hissed at him through the silence just wait ron said crossing his arms as if on queue a young hermione and ron poured through the tower door they were both laughing and wearing evening clothes he was holding her hand that possibly the funniest thing i ve ever heard hermione giggled oh that nothing ron explained i ve done worse things then that i haventeven told you about the time we fed the giant squid a peanut butter sandwich that was a classic hermione laughed again but ron just stared into her eyes i had a really great time tonight he said honestly me too hermione replied quietly i never thought i could have so much fun me either ron replied this is the best date i ve ever been on hermione snorted honestly you re something special hermione hermione slowly tipped her head to one side as ron lent slowly in their lips met with a smile and warmth filled the room harry looked over to the current day ron and hermione and found them both transfixed a tingling filled harry stomach as he turned back to the kissing couple it was so simple and so sweet with a pouring of colour the scene changed once more harry turned to ron in question and he replied only two more the trio was now outside in a grungy wet day rain was pouring from the thundering gray sky yet not a drop touched harry ron or hermione clothes they waited in silence before a drenched hermione stormed towards them stop a voice boomed and hermione stopped a foot in front of the trio wait you know i didntmean it but you said it hermione shouted as ron run up to her you said it and you cantjust take it back please ron begged tears threatening to leak from his eyes no hermione argued we re over it just too late just one more chance ron pleaded i ll make it up to you no hermione said sharply turning away it too late ron retreated biting his lip he d suddenly lost his boyish charm and looked cold and weak he shivered and slowly fumbled towards what appeared to be the burrow in the distance as soon as ron was out of earshot hermione began to cry she sobbed into her hands and her shoulders shook as the heavy rain beated against them for harry it was like he was watching a film these people werentpeople he knew but people in love and at that moment he wanted more than anything for them to be together he almost tried to will hermione to run back to ron and tell him she d forgive him after a moment hermione lifted her head in a decision harry heart leapt as she slowly took a step towards the burrow before running as fast as she could battling against the storm the trio eyes followed her as she ran past them and towards a passionate ron who was heading in her direction they met in the middle and embraced each other in a kiss harry felt relieved as he ron and hermione approached the couple i love you ron said his voice crackling as they pulled apart i love you too she said then pulled ron into a hug with her cheek resting on his chest the rain swiftly changed into four red walls walls which harry didntrecognize he d didnthave long to ponder on them though as something else caught his eye in the center if the room were 7th year ron and hermione lounging on a silky red bed before harry had time to predict it ron had lent over and kissed hermione it was so natural that harry hardly took notice to it but before long things got more noticeable ron and hermione were passionately entwined with each other the room was heated and harry suddenly felt uncomfortable should we go harry asked ron almost inaudibly not yet he answered the couple suddenly pulled apart and harry was put at ease again we need to stop ron said putting a hand in his pocket look there something i ve been meaning to give you ron bought a small red box out of his pocket and opened it to hermione inside sat a silver ring with a small pink crystal on top both hermione gasped as ron took it out as sat it in the palm of his hand it a promise ring ron explained i want you to have it as a promise that we ll always be together we ve talked about the future before and i stand by what i said i cantsee my future without you in it hermione tilted her head to one side looking as if she was about to cry i know this probably doesntmean a lot ron said looking down it not an engagement ring or a key to a new house together or any of the things we ve talked about but it the best i can do while we re still at school it perfect hermione said simply ron undid the chain that hermione wore round her neck and threaded the ring on it before doing it back up again wear this as a reminder of us ron said a reminder that we ll always be together my father gave that ring to my mother when they were at school then my mother passed it on to me for you and someday we ll pass it down to our son hermione smiled and pulled ron into a celebrating hug the room rapidly dissolved for what harry felt was the final time and the trio arrived back where they had started the embers were now burning down the bottom of the common room fire and the room sat vacantly harry and ron fell back into comfy chairs resting their thought filled heads hermione stood deadly still that was enlightening harry said huskily to break the silence ron nodded his head well now you know how things were he said staring into the fireplace i never thought it would be like that harry added mainly to keep a conversation going i can understand that that got you thinking i dontblame you for thinking that showing us might change things well i was right wasnti ron inquired standing up tiredly it has changed things ron looked at hermione who was staring confusedly at her entwined fingers you re being awfully quiet hermione harry said as casually as he could i need to be alone hermione said looking directly at harry i going to go to bed hermione started to pack up some of the books she d left on the table earlier you ll think about it wont you hermione ron suddenly asked sounding worried hermione walked over to ron and gave him a hesitant kiss on the lips before saying goodnight and disappearing swiftly up the girls staircase a n another chapter jus

the room turned black the silence rung in harry ears he had to do something but his body was paralyzed the large doors swung open and light slithered into the room harry closed his eyes as he was blinded once more and unconsciousness closed the scene harry opened his eyes sharply ready to get up and help ginny for he was sure it was her screaming but found that he was no longer in the great hall he was lying in the middle of his dormitory with his blankets wound tightly around him morning harry ron said ordinarily as he strolled out of the bathroom ready for lessons do i look like i ready harry tried to ask seriously but ended up grinning he untangled himself from his cocoon and put on his dressing gown dontworry ron said spiking his hair in the mirror lessons dontstart for an hour harry picked up his uniform and was about to tell ron of his nightmare when ron spoke again hermione not up yet he said sadly she not in the library or the great hall i asked lavender but she hasntseen hermione either so do you like hermione or am i barking up the wrong tree harry asked sitting on his bed what about a tree ron questioned tiredly never mind do you like hermione harry repeated and ron looked away so that a yes that closer to a yes then a no but more like a dontknow ron explained i mean that pensieve got me thinking about us if there is an us i mean you saw it it was perfect what am i supposed to think you re not supposed to think you re supposed to feel harry said explaining it as best he could do you love her i 17 years old ron said brushing off harry question i dont love anyone but i think i might like her a lot do you think it would be worth giving it a go with hermione that entirely up to you harry smiled taking a step towards the bathroom ask dean and seamus if you want advice they might be a little less biased but they already think i going out with hermione ron stressed i cantask them what do you think i think you should leave it to hermione harry said as he began to close the bathroom door you asked her to think about it and i sure when she has she ll come to you with an answer harry arrived in the great hall about half an hour later and found hermione sitting alone at gryffindor table the other marauders erin and lav pav and crew were nowhere in sight where everyone gone harry asked hermione as he sat down next to her apparently theres some sort of notice about a dueling club in our common rooms hermione droned but i dontknow i wasntreally listening harry helped himself to eggs and bacon before turning to hermione again so have you seen ron he asked no hermione replied bluntly harry poured himself some pumpkin juice have you though about the pensieve he asked i ve thought of nothing else hermione sighed what am i supposed to do i dontknow harry said perking up at the chance to question hermione what do you think of ron you know i think very highly of ron hermione answered buttering some toast that not what i meant harry said simply i know hermione replied so harry said so i might like him might hermione stressed but he my best friend i dontsee how this could work of course it could work hermione harry said if you wanted it to that the thing do i hermione explained i dontthink i do i mean ron is gorgeous but that it why ruin our whole friendship just because i think ron good looking so you dontlove him harry asked seriously no i dontthink so hermione said putting her forefinger to her lips we re too young to know what love is anyway that what ron said harry smiled sadly oh hermione said dropping her fork he did harry nodded his head and hermione suddenly looked upset well for once ron actually got something right she said broadly standing up me and ron being together that ludicrous but you re still going to the ball with him harry asked as she picked up her bag well yes hermione answered almost automatically i mean he doesntlove me and i dontlove him so everything worked out ok now if he d loved me then we would have had problems hermione marched passionately out of the hall and harry was sure that she wasnttelling the whole truth even though it made perfect sense for harry friday lessons were a total drag he had to sit in between hermione and ron both of whom had momentarily stooped speaking to the other and seamus and dean were of very little help by the time the final bell rang harry was aching to leave he charged out of the classroom and straight to the common room where he took his favorite chair by the fire and was joined by ron and hermione only minutes later so ron said clearing his voice in a rehearsed mannor you ready to talk yes hermione replied uniformly so the pensieve you think ron asked hesitantly i think it was misleading hermione said calmly i think it put thoughts into our heads me too ron agreed i mean i didnthave a single romantic feeling for you before i saw those memories me either hermione smiled so it all the pensieve fault i think it is ron grinned and things are so much easier if we re not together hermione explained yeah ron agreed we can just stay as we are best friends perfect hermione said to close the conversation you know harry said looking from face to face just because something easy it doesntmean it right thanks for the words of wisdom mate but i think we re sorted ron said standing come for a walk sure hermione smiled taking ron hand automatically and the pair slowly sauntered away harry sighed and picked up of the table the last letter his parents had written to him harry suddenly felt a warmth fill his stomach as he though of seeing them in just over a week hi harry ginny smiled as she took the seat which ron had previously occupied harry looked over ginny shoulder and found that her small group of followers had stopped right behind her hey harry grinned confidently before asking cheekily and how are you and your crew today me and my crew are fine she replied looking almost as if she was trying not to laugh good good harry smiled would your crew like to go away for a while so we can have a private conversation ginny turned to the girls and they slowly left sorry ginny apologized they have no lives of their own it doesnttake a genius to work that out harry laughed and was surprised when ginny joined in he didntexpect her to make fun of her friends this is nice harry said more genuinely than he had planned we never get to just sit down and talk i know ginny sighed i just always busy helping them with their problems helping them choose dress robes telling them which boys to date doesntsound like you enjoy it too much harry said looking concerned i don t ginny said shrugging her shoulders harry smiled thinking about how real ginny was she seemed to be the only down to earth girl in the whole of hogwarts he could understand why the other harry had fallen for her and wished just a little that the ginny in his world was a little more like this one are you alright ginny asked putting a hand on harry arm fine just thinking harry smiled fancy a trip down to the kitchens i haventseen the house elves in a while me either ginny replied lets go if we hurry the house elves will have us a batch of jam tarts done before quidditch practice harry and ginny trekked happily down to the kitchens and their demands were soon met the house elves even sorted a table and chairs for them to sit at while they produced endless sweets and desserts you know what i really fancy ginny giggled and she pilled apple pie onto her plate err a date with snape harry suggested teasingly and ginny swatted him round the head no she grinned cheesecake you would like muffy to get missis some cheesecake a black house elf asked ginny cool ginny smiled make that two harry added as he poured cream onto his chocolate cake so how are you gin apart from absolutely gorgeous of course i fine ginny said though there was something distant about her tone and you mr potter i great harry replied stabbing his cake with his spoon christmas soon quidditch match on saturday i in a great mood good good ginny smiled as she lent over for the custard and dropped a lock of hair into her cake harry laughed and ginny stopped dead still what she asked raising an eyebrow harry laughed again and ginny noticed the apple slime in her hair think that funny do you ginny asked looking humorously murderous maybe harry smiled and ginny flicked a spoon full of custard at harry face harry wiped the thick yellow glupe slowly out of his eyes before lifting up the pitcher of cream and saying this is war some time later a very messy harry and ginny left the kitchens laughing their heads off each carried a string tied box with cheesecake inside under their arm and wore enough dessert on their clothes to feed an army i dontthink the house elves knew what to think harry laughed especially when you picked up that whole sponge cake and shoved it in my face at least i didnthit a house elf ginny exclaimed as she wiped jam off her neck that gray house elf fell into a trifle and it took 3 other house elves to pull it out oh well they needed something to do harry insisted you know what they re like please sir can i get you some food can i wash your socks can i lick your shoes can i jump off a cliff for you sir ginny burst out laughing again as they rounded the corner and approached the entrance hall you know you re the only person who can make me laugh like this ginny smiled i never thought i could have so much fun i never thought i d ever have a food fight well this is a once off harry grinned i think that jam stained my shirt that nothing ginny exclaimed i ve got clotted cream down my bra the pair began to laugh again and harry couldnthelp noticing how beautiful ginny looked she was covered head to toe in cake her hair was clumped with cream yet she still stood confidently with her lips formed in a perfect smile her eyes were large and bright and her freckles perfectly placed she was the only girl harry could think of who always looked perfect harry ginny questioned and harry stomach suddenly fluttered we need to head to quidditch oh yeah harry said clearing his voice and turning to walk in the other direction i forgot match on saturday after hogsmeade ginny grumbled i going to be pooped after a day of shopping you and hermione are going arentyou harry asked and got a nod in reply i think i ll drag ron to honeydukes canthave too many sweets well i ve got to choose a dress robe for the ball ginny sighed i have no idea what to get you ll look nice in anything harry smiled trust me well anything better than that awful old yellow thing i wore last time ginny joked harry chuckled thinking of ginny second hand yule ball dress before it hit him wait harry said stopping dead still his face was white and determined thinking through the possibilities trying to work out the chance that he was right oh my ginny panicked with her hands clamped over her mouth harry dropped his cake now the cats among the pixies ginny harry said trying to calm her as she reached inside her pocket for her wand ginny stop harry grabbed ginny wand arm strongly and used his other hand to sweep his fringe aside revealing a deep lightning scar it you ginny gasped looking harry in the eyes isntit harry nodded his head in disbelief and let go of ginny arm i i thought i was the only one ginny whispered tears filling up in her eyes i thought i was the only one whoknew about voldemort the only person here alone harry pulled ginny into a tight hug and let her cry onto his shoulder for a moment everything harry knew seemed to fall apart and harry felt a large empty gap form in his stomach the gap which could only be filled by the people he loved and the life he had led he suddenly felt like he needed to go home a n sorry it been a while but i decided to take a well earned christmas break i wrote this chapter yesterday and it filled with info and stuff to keep you thinking so get reading oh and next chapter there more malfoy yay he back for good so go and read what are you waiting for hugs and smiles angel chapter 27 just ginny so who else knows ginny asked harry as she wiped the tears away from her eyes harry and ginny had made their way quickly back to a deserted common room and sat curled up on a sofa in front of the fire ron and hermione harry answered they re here too the real them ginny shook her head and cuddled her legs up to her chest are they really together she questioned looking open eyed at harry i mean are they really dating no harry replied with a hand on his head it complicated oh ginny whispered and closed her eyes i never even thought that it could possibly be you harry admitted you ve been so different you look so perfect ginny asked and was followed with silence well i guess that shows that anyone can be perfect with enough clothes and make up anyone harry somehow wanted to right her to tell her how that she wasntjust anyone but the words couldntcome to him there was no doubt in his mind that what she d said was wrong but he didntknow how to make it right ginny harry tried it not the clothes and make up that made you perfect it was you you were yourself please cheer up i fine harry ginny sighed if it makes you feel any better i didntask you to the ball just because i thought you were pretty or popular i asked you because i liked you harry explained sincerely just you ginny gave harry a heart warming smile and a friendly hug i dontknow how you kept this up for so long alone harry said i would have gone mad i thought i was going mad sometimes ginny laughed dryly i just didntknow what else to do but keep it up how did you know what the other ginny was like harry asked i mean i lucky i still have the same friends but you have a whole tribe of new ones to keep up with i read it in ginny diary ginny explained the other me keeps a diary of everything she does she writes an essay in it every evening when i first woke up in this world i found it open on my lap i ve been reading it in continually ever since wow harry whispered i wish i d had one it would have made things so much easier and weirder ginny shivered it like you telling yourself what happened yet you dontremember it ever taking place ginny rested her chin on her knees before asking how did we get here i cantanswer that harry said softly leaning his head on the back of the sofa to tell you the truth i dontreally know i know we were in the common room and i was mad i had hermione time turner and i threw it as i hard as i could i wished that voldemort had never gone bad ginny said numbly then sat up and looked round at harry hermione and ron were still in the common room when you threw it werentthey i think so yeah they hadntgone to bed yet harry said thinking as hard as he could with a headache brewing you had though how come you were transported too i came back downstairs for my book ginny said simply lacing her fingers in her lap i forgot to take it upstairs with me so i went back down the stairs again and when i reached the bottom everything went black harry let out an exasperated sigh and threw his hands behind his head in frustration ginny looked him wearily in the eyes before lifting her hand to his face and massaging his right temple harry closed his eyes for a moment and reopened them a minute later in surprise how did you do that harry asked looking steadily into ginny cinnamon eyes do what ginny asked make the pain go away harry said gently putting a hand to his head in examination i ve always been able to do it ginny shrugged cuddling her knees once more my dad says i must have healing powers and that i should become a healer one day harry simply grinned at ginny and suddenly felt all his insecurities fade away dontlook so surprised though it not as exciting as all erin divination talents ginny smiled lamely she can feel when things are wrong and she can see auras and stuff i think i ll have to ask erin about that harry chuckled before realizing erin she at quidditch practice where we re supposed to be damn ginny cursed looking longingly out of the window well it too late now they ll all be finishing in about 40 minutes and by the time we get down there ginny sighed and picked up a book off her desk well i ve got an essay to write anyway ginny huffed and picked up her quill so i haventspoken to you for over a month and a half and now you re going to spend the time we have to catch up writing a pointless essay which wonteven count when you go back home harry stressed making ginny laugh ok you have a point she said putting the book down but it not like we haventtalked i talk to you almost everyday harry but that wasntlike talking to you for me harry tried to explain i thought you were someone else i was always showing off trying to impress people and i was flirting with you stupidly you must have thought i was a right prat no i liked it ginny laughed harmlessly really harry asked raising an eyebrow i said i d go to the ball with you didnti ginny smiled lopsidedly it was fun harmless flirting you amused me i like your company harry and you never fail to cheer me up good harry said feeling a familiar churn in the pit of his stomach i like to see you smiling ginny opened her mouth to speak but then faltered her eyes finding their way to harry s she smiled honestly and every freckle on her face smiled with her so can i do my essay now she asked with an cheeky glint in her eyes go for it harry grinned massaging his fluttering stomach what it for history of magic ginny said emotionlessly riddle wants an essay on troll rebellions or something harry sat forward in his seat a new question suddenly filling his head why do you visit riddle so often harry words must have shocked ginny as she stiffened for a moment before answering he a lonely old man in need of some company ginny said almost warmly he has problems and leans to me for advice i his favorite pupil the only one who understands him you understand him because you wrote in his diary for a year harry said harshly before he tried to drain the life out of you but this isnthim harry ginny stressed turning to face harry this is the tom i knew the listener the great smart man who i wrote to and who helped me through my problems i know the way his mind works harry and i the only one who understands he realizes that i know him too yet he cantseem to figure out how well what happens when he does harry exclaimed he can t ginny said putting a hand on harry knee it not possible he needs me as a friend that all what do you talk to him about harry asked solemnly riddle wants to leave hogwarts ginny explained he needs a change of scene a job that maybe maybe a little more demanding a job where he can be higher up a job which includes a gang of deatheaters harry asked humoring himself look you just have to trust me ginny pleaded whenever he begins to lean in the wrong direction i advice him to do something else i can change him harry before he makes the wrong choices so you think there still a possibility that he could become lord voldemort harry asked jumping up from his seat of course not ginny assured harry unless the prophecy was still made wait harry said dropping back into his seat if the prophecy was still made then he still going to become voldmort harry we cantbe sure ginny said but just incase i ve been going to see him he seems fine i still going to run this by hermione harry mumbled feeling his headache come back look if it makes you feel any better we could go and see riddle now ginny suggested lightly he seems quite fond of you fond enough to chose me over neville 17 years ago harry grumbled to himself before saying lets go twenty six corridors and three sets of staircases later they arrived outside riddles office ginny knocked softly on the door who is it a fatherly voice asked it me ginny chirped me and harry ginny pushed open the heavy door and harry followed her inside to a familiar dusty office riddle sat warmly behind his desk which was strewn with loose pieces of parchment good evening riddle smiled almost falsely ginny didntseem to notice evening harry muttered keeping his eyes on the floor hope we arentinterrupting anything ginny said like a young na ve child i thought i d bring harry with me as he had some interesting job ideas for you did he really riddle asked as he raked in all the papers off his desk with his wand before making them burn to ashes in midair harry and ginny took seats opposite him well that very nice of you harry riddle said almost spitting harry name but i ve found a job to suit me i got the letter of acceptance only today that brilliant ginny cheered what is it some teaching work with a private student riddle announced almost smugly i ll be my own boss and the hours are agreeable it exactly what i was looking for ginny turned to harry and gave him a knowing smile he had to admit it sounded perfect too perfect for harry liking so when are you leaving ginny asked her eyes lit up with excitement i not too sure yet riddle said strangely almost as if it had only just occurred to him it undecided i ll probably just leave suddenly when i called for does dumbledore know yet harry asked looking at the ashes on riddle desk not yet but he ll know when i leave riddle hissed for now this needs to stay as our little secret ok both students nodded their heads mutely feeling almost as if they were signing their souls away to satan good riddle smiled unsettlingly now who would like some hot chocolate harry and ginny stumbled out of riddles office some time later their tummies full of hot chocolate and biscuits and their minds full of questions they bid him goodbye and walked away unsurely not speaking until they d rounded the corner well judge for yourself ginny said openly throwing her arms out at her sides he seems nice but something just doesntadd up harry explained as they rounded the corner there something about him he makes me feel uneasy the giant squid makes me feel uneasy but he not an evil dark wizard ginny smiled riddles not an evil dark wizard not yet harry said softly to himself as ginny raced up the stairs you re too trusting and you re too untrusting ginny said finally now hurry up if we get to the common room quickly we can probably catch the others and apologize about quidditch before they head off to bed we re sorry for the millionth time harry droned once he was back in the common room we just forgot i bet you they were making out seamus grinned to dean they d better not have been ron grouched eyeing harry suspiciously oh ron hermione sighed give them a break what were you doing then erin asked crossing her arms reading ginny said sweetly and seamus snorted oh really dean slurred prove it prove we weren t ginny said cheekily putting an arm round harry leave them alone daisy grinned as erin whispered something amusing in her ear if they got together it would about time harry suddenly went red and scratched his head nervously lets go to bed erin said sensing her brothers discomfort but i dontwant to dean grumbled to erin who pouted at him please she said then you can get up bright and early to meet me for breakfast before hogsmeade alright dean grinned and erin gave him a kiss on the cheek thrashed seamus coughed humorously whatever dean said dismissively lets just go everyone began to exit to their dormitories before harry and ginny pulled ron and hermione back what ron asked bluntly before ginny put her hand over his mouth when the others were out of earshot and sight harry enlightened a very confused looking ron and hermione its ginny harry announced good harry now what color is the carpet ron asked in a patronizing tone no it really me ginny chuckled i from your world you know with you know who ron mouth dropped open about a mile and hermione pulled ginny into the tightest hug oh ginny i had no idea hermione exclaimed she let it slip earlier harry explained as hermione and ginny pulled apart but you werentyou were you ron asked looking confused it me ronnikins ginny said as she hugged ron tight i ve missed you guys a comforting silence filled the room for a moment before hermione broke it well this definitely gives us something to talk about at hogsmeade tomorrow hermione yawned yeah ron grinned ruffling ginny hair fondly lets talk tomorrow i dead from quidditch you canthonestly tell me you worked hard without me there to supervise harry laughed no but it was worth a try ron shrugged goodnight yeah night hermione smiled giving ginny a final hug before her and ron headed off to bed wow ginny sighed one minute i all alone and the next i ve got all my best friends with me you know no one could replace you guys i should think not harry smiled genuinely as he wandered aimlessly towards the boys staircase harry ginny asked almost inaudibly harry turned round to face a very awkward looking ginny twiddling with her cloak are we still on for the ball i mean as i me now and you re you you donthave to go with me what harry asked concerned more than anything else i mean if you d rather go with someone else then i wont be offended ginny explained looking like a little lost puppy harry heart went out to her and he suddenly felt a tugging in his throat why wouldnti want to go with you harry asked softly trying to understand as he approached ginny well i not ginny the popular cute and fun one anymore ginny said wrapping her arms round herself defensively i just ginny plain and boring i ve never thought you were plain or boring harry said strongly the words issuing from his mouth before he d even thought about them you re funny and interesting and pretty beautiful even ginny eyes lit up and harry held his breath thanks she said sadly you re a good friend i try harry sighed not quite knowing what to say so do you still want to go with me even thought i not the wonderful flirty prank hero harry you ll always be my hero ginny grinned and embraced harry in a friendly hug which caused harry stomach to flutter when they pulled apart harry looked wonderingly into ginny eyes before asking her another question what made you say yes to me anyway surely the diary told you that ginny was never going to say yes not quite ginny smiled something silently amusing her from what i read she was coming close to saying yes i think she would have gotten there i suppose we cantbe sure but you said yes anyway harry stated almost itching to take ginny hand and read her mind yes she giggled i guess seeing you here and the ball it reminded me of how i used to be a few years ago i would have done anything to have gone to a ball with you i guess i thought i owed it to myself owed it to the little girl in the chamber of secrets who wanted more than anything for you to like her harry stood thoughtfully for a moment feeling all of a sudden sorry for the things he d never said to ginny things which could have made a great deal of difference to a little girl but she wasnta little girl anymore she was a beautiful young lady who he suddenly had a thousand things to say to and just one thing to do to he lent in surely and kissed ginny softly on the lips and then pulled away somewhat regretfully for all the things i never did harry said warmly taking one of ginny hands in both of his ginny nodded her head and looked him fondly in the eyes with an understanding between them i going to bed ginny smiled and hugged harry automatically night gin harry said as he smelt her hair when they pulled apart harry suddenly had the strange urge to kiss her again but he resisted she pranced to the bottom of the girls staircase and harry was watching her when she turned to speak to him again i never got a chance before to thank you for asking me to the ball ginny said shyly i wasntplanning on going until you asked me why not harry wondered aloud i just didntwant to spend the whole evening dancing with some random boy ginny said sounding more like her old self well what were you going to do instead harry asked sit alone and bored all by yourself no ginny said with ease i d promised riddle i d help him with school things that evening good night harry felt a sick cold sweat wash over him as ginny climbed out of sight there was something ill about riddle situation which harry knew he was yet to figure out review a n sorry it been a while but my life suddenly got busy i back to school now so things might slow down but i hope not i eager to finish this story sometime soon not thats we re nearing the end yet so reviews are great some people asked about the repeated line in the end of the last chapter i did that on purpose i thought that maybe you and harry could do with reminding if you didntnotice then dontworry someone else asked if when ginny got her wand out when she was with harry chapter 26 if she was going to use a memory charm the answer is yes ginny would have tried if harry hadntstopped her another reviewer asked me why i d called the chapter cat among the pixies and what it meant i took the phrase from ootp mrs figg says it sometime near the begining of the book i chose for the phrase tomean the same as the muggle phrase cat out of the bag i figured as it sounded quite similar and was in a similar context in the book as in my story that now the cats among the pixies was just the wizardring was of saying now the cats out of the bag thanks again for the wonderful words of encouragment in your reviews i ve decided that as we re so close to 500 reviews jumps up and down that the 500th reviewer gets a special surprise i ve got it all planned so keep reviewing oh and if you think you might be the 500th reviewer leave your email address so i can get back to you hugs and smiles angel chapter 28 erin explains hogsmeade looked like a fairytale when the students arrived soft icing sugar snow rested on the top of enchanted candy houses ice hung like twinkling ornaments from every peak and place the village could have been a picture on the front of a christmas card the gang trooped to their meeting place outside of honeydukes and decided to split well me ginny erin and daisy need to shop for dress robes hermione announced well us guys have got loads of important stuff to do too seamus said elbowing ron in the ribs yeah tons of stuff ron agreed clearing his throat so much stuff that i cant even think of anything well great erin chuckled taking dean hand we ll meet you guys back here for lunch then sorry but no can do ginny frowned i have to meet the girls for lunch do you really have to harry whined tugging on her sleeve childishly sorry but i do ginny laughed now full steam ahead we have some dress robes to buy see you later boys daisy chirped as she dragged erin away from dean bye dean grumbled now what do we do prongs well harry mumbled i dontknow about you but i certainly haventbought any christmas presents yet shopping already seamus moaned we ve still got a week until christmas that plenty of time dean and ron muttered in agreement come on you guys harry said with all the enthusiasm he could muster wormy you ve got to get my sister a present for a start why we re not going out officially or anything dean mumbled dontbe such humbugs harry exclaimed i in a good mood so full steam ahead now you re starting to sound like ginny ron grumbled i think she rubbing off on you the boys went to honeydukes then zonkos followed by a jewelry shop an antiques shop a bits and bobs shop and of course a robe shop after a while their legs started to ache and they stumbled across a bench at the edge of hogsmeade overlooking a beautiful iced lake who votes for break time ron asked and all three raised their hands they flopped onto the bench and chucked their shopping bags onto a peaceful heap harry took a packet of chocolate frogs out and shared them around as the boys enjoyed a rested silence a silence which was soon broken a gang of tall boys at least ron height and twice his breadth were sniggering and jeering in an immature fashion two stood out right away as being crabbe and goyle their statures were impossible to miss another after a moment of watching carelessly could be recognized as blaise they were pushing something around in the center of the group which harry couldntsee he figured it was some sort of an animal and was about to get up and defend it before he realized that it was a person two of the gang picked up a small boy and took a struggling arm each he was only half their size perhaps a second year and he was fighting as best he could his hair was light blond and hung perfectly across his innocent gray blue eyes his features were unmistakable he was a malfoy as if on cue draco pushed his way to the center of the group and wrestled the young boy from their grasp come on seb lets go draco ordered pulling his brother away the boy didntneed telling twice after giving draco a thankful glance he ran away as fast as he could and as white as a sheet what the problem malfoy blaise slurred and his gang sniggered no problem draco said calmly but shaking all the same not now harry watched draco walk slowly but surly away before being pulled back by blaise and where are you going blaise questioned did i say i was finished did i say i cared draco replied bravely pulling himself from the dark boys grip blaise pushed him effortlessly to the floor and draco wand was thrown aside i dontlike your tone blaise spat at draco well i dontlike your face draco stated but i not complaining get him blaise one of the gang muttered eagerly as blaise pulled draco back to his feet by the scruff of his neck how about we make a bargain blaise smirked i let you go and you let me borrow your sister you stay away from my sister draco said in a low warning voice i ll stay away from her said blaise with menace reflecting in his eyes but i cantguarantee she ll stay away from me blaise sniggered maliciously causing draco to loose his temper and spit straight in blaise eye within seconds draco was on the floor and being beaten by the assembly harry signaled and the marauder rushed to help just before draco lost consciousness i can never thank you enough draco sighed over a warm butter beer at lunch time no problem ron smiled finding himself amused at getting thanks from malfoy we were glad to help harry insisted you didnthave too malfoy mumbled massaging his bruised jaw of course we did you were out numbered harry said it wasntfair and we figured the odds of you coming out there alive without help were slim dean grinned downing the last of his butter beer let me get the next round draco said quickly standing up but you got the last said ron confused it the least i could do draco smiled sadly before he headed up to the bar he a really nice bloke isnthe ron said grinning and giving harry a surprised sideways look yeah he well alright seamus agreed just a bit tragic he always looks so sad and he has no self confidence dean commented i dontget it all slytherins are cocky well he doesntreally have a reason to be confident does he harry said quietly he always being beaten up by blaise i supposed that got to suck the confidence out of you ron said feeling empathy for malfoy and you know his past seamus whispered and the others nodded we should ask him to hang out more ron said brightly he could definitely do with some fun hey boys erin called as the girls grabbed chairs and seized their table what up daisy asked squeezing in next to harry not a lot ron said moving to make room for erin well we ve all done our shopping hermione smile simply hiding her bag quickly under the table eh guys who chair is that erin asked eyeing the seat in question suspiciously hey i got the draco stopped mid sentence noticing the increase in people i ll go get some more dontworry about it said harry signaling for him to sit down then turning to the girls you all know draco erin whispered something in daisy ear which made her blush hermione was the only one who seemed to notice draco bruises what happened she asked anxiously as draco took his seat next to hers i had a little run in with blaise he said soberly nothing to worry about but you re bleeding hermione said looking fearfully at his cheek it alright hermione ron said sounding slightly peeved he going to get it sorted when we get back to the castle you donthave to i know some healing spells that will sort that out right away hermione said motherly as she hurriedly got out her wand there really know need draco said softly with a small admiring smile but thanks anyway oh ok hermione mumbled so what happened daisy asked blaise was picking on seb again draco sighed and the girls aahed it not right he only a 3rd year and blaise said something about your sister too harry said remembering didnthe yes draco answered through gritted teeth he always messing with isabel but she wonthave it she knows what he like i dontmean to be rude or anything dean said but lets talk about something a little nicer for a while and sort this out when we get back to school ok draco said shyly before turning to hermione with a hopeful smile so have you done your transfiguration essay i thought it was really difficult there was a mostly pleasant atmosphere during lunch the only person who failed to enjoy himself was ron who seemed to struggle watching hermione get along so well with malfoy and made a point of taking hermione hand on the way out harry was content to join in the conversations but failed to eat anything he just didntfeel like it there was a sad pain in the bottom of harry stomach which seemed to be taking up all the space he wouldnthave minded but he knew the hurt was selfishly not sympathy for draco but an ache for the company of a certain absent red head the gang made it back to hogwarts with just 30 minutes spare time before quidditch practice was to begin they bid goodbye to draco and hermione at the quidditch field gates some less happy about the arrangements then others then piled inside the changing rooms what is up with him ron charged once they were inside we ask him to hang out once and he takes that as an invitation to take hermione off on a tour of the rose gardens i didntknow hogwarts had rose gardens seamus mumbled as he pulled out his uniform exactly ron raged but they re going to have a look at the roses before heading inside for a mug of hot chocolate in the great hall well if you think he moving in on hermione you should do something said dean cause if she likes him more then you you need to end it quick ron face had suddenly flicked from hot red to sheet white i dontknow ron mumbled sitting down marauders dontget dumped ron seamus reminded him perhaps trying to be helpful even if you have given her all that promise ring rubbish she wontdump me ron said honestly but she could like him more who like who erin questioned as she cheerily poked her head round the door hello erin boys changing in here seamus clarified oh i dontmind erin said as she strolled happily inside clearly missing or ignoring the point so who malfoy and hermione dean enlightened her oh erin grinned hermione doesntlike him how d you know ron grumbled at her tossing his t short off because i know everything erin replied knowingly looking from ron to harry it put harry at unease as he was unsure whether or not to take her seriously well i think have to agree with erin harry said slumping off his chair you lot are just over reacting i taking a shower ron explained before wandering off boys daisy smiled sticking her head round the door i suggest one of you heads back to the castle as ginny hasntturned up for practice incase you hadntnoticed i vote erin dean grinned raising his hand oh i cantbe bothered erin whined slapping dean juvenily round the head i ll go harry said simply and expressionlessly of course you would erin grinned obviously rolling her eyes harry paced towards the door hoping for no more taunting for his reason of departing i thought you said there was no hope for harry and gin dean remembered causing harry to turn back to retaliate there wasn t said erin amusingly but there is for them two now harry stumbled away wondering what erin had meant well it was obvious and simple in one way but somehow it had made harry feel at ill ease so erin thought she knew everything so what harry knew too well that nobody knew everything not even dumbledore full to the brim with thoughts harry didnteven notice when he walked straight into a sprinting red head oh sorry ginny mumbled righting herself clinging to his arms i was just in such a hurry no problem he said deeply noting that with her head down she hadntyet recognized him oh harry ginny grinned looking up bearing brightly into his deep greed eyes sorry i late i just got caught up with the with the girls in the great hall were hermione and draco there harry asked slowly letting go of ginny yes apparently i missed a lot at lunch ginny mused you did indeed said harry watching her smile draco with the whole gang now ginny explained they re treating him like some sort of a war hero or something figures harry grinned looking at how ginny snow flake freckles sat across her nose well do you want to head to quidditch ginny asked with a lopsided look and harry suddenly felt his cheeks burn sure he coughed lets got quidditch practice wasntreally a chore for the team it seemed merely an excuse to fly around which they all seemed to enjoy more then perhaps was healthy but an obsession with flying was no problem when you were up there up there there are no worries just you and the sky quidditch practice finished on a high and although little work had taken place the team was as good as ever they were more then ready to face hufflepuff the following day great practice team harry cheered as he ushered everyone inside we re going to thrash hufflepuff well derr it is hufflepuff dean insisted and harry pushed him childishly through the door never underestimate an opponent harry insisted nice to hear you talk some sense and have some real team spirit erin said shaking her head with a smile as she lent tirelessly against the wall what up with you harry couldnthelp but ask instead of a simple question it came out as more of a demand you keep saying things like you re not telling me something i the one not telling you something erin chuckled give up harry you know i can read you like a book seriously harry said you made comments a while ago and i got confused so i left it but now i want to know harry erin said simply i not the one who needs to do the telling now am i harry felt unsettled by erin confidence erin harry pleaded as erin trooped past him come back i honestly dontknow what you re talking about if it something to do with ginny you ll just have to ask me i thought you were the one who knew everything anyway i am erin said stopping a footstep away from harry which is why i noticed that you ve not been yourself lately dontbe ridiculous harry mumbled with a suddenly dry throat but it true erin said sounding barely bothered and that because it not you who are you and how did you get here erin looked questioningly at harry yet not accusingly she looked like a confused child waiting for a parent to explain the answer to an unexplainable question a parent or a brother lets go inside harry said cantwait for the next chapter then you d better review and remember the 500th reviewer gets a super surprise and leave your email address if you want the surprise see authers note a n heya rock on people the reviews are rolling in special thanks to lil miss potter i think it was who gave me

viewing of 3 chapters which means shes already read this chapter and chapter 30 hehe andher very own characterin the ball chapter so back to now this chapters a pretty long one which is why i ve not

them all my best angel chapter 29 wet truths for brooke harry stormed into the common room with erin at his heels he sharply turned to face her once he d reached the fireplace and ran a stressed hand through his matted hair so an explanation would be nice erin said sounding hassled she stood facing harry confidently with her hands on her hips and her long read hair tousled from flying i dontknow where to start harry said but it was like trying to speak underwater only a small whisper escaped his lips well who you are might be a good place erin said softening slightly at harry discomfort i harry james potter just not the one you know harry explained and erin gave him a severe look i dontlike liars she replied simply but i not harry exclaimed throwing his arms in the air i me i not some random person pretending to be your brother i not using polyjuice potion i not inside his head i myself inside my own body i just in the wrong place how is that possible erin asked taking a seat harry never had a twin and we donthave any relations that resemble him so erin put a confused hand to her pale cheek and harry sat comfortingly beside her look you ve just got to trust me harry said listen to what i have to say then trust me who knows maybe you could even help harry shifted uncomfortably and erin lifted her weary burly gaze to his eyes so two strong hazel eyes asked i come from a different world harry spoke slowly a different universe perhaps the same time the same place but a different story harry lifted his tangled black fringe to bear a deep lightening scar erin raised a hand to her mouth in shock and lifted the other as if to touch it a scar like that that can only be produced by a dark curse hitting you i read about it in our library erin stammered before pulling herself together and saying strongly i ready to listen harry and erin escaped to the astronomy tower before they were interrupted and harry found himself telling erin everything from the day he got his scar to the day he found himself in this other world erin listened intently and spoke very little harry wasnteven sure if she believed him or not so that how it is harry said once he d finished or how it was i dontknow how it is now dontyou want to go back erin asked looking concerned so you do believe me harry grinned and erin smiled in reply apparently so harry wiped his tired eyes a million questions filtering through his brain which only a sister could answer so this voldemort erin said with an unexpected shiver who is he i mean do you think he ll come here theres a possibility harry said shifting his gaze across the floor it depends whether the prophesy was created or not right so what his real name voldemort isnthis fist name surely erin asked brushing a strand of cinnamon hair behind her ear harry sat still that not important right now harry said you just have to trust me that i working everything out if i tell you it ll only worry you and probably for no reason if i find out he coming back you ll be the first to know good erin half smiled looking a little more settled so in your world our parents died before i was even born yes harry hushed with a sigh remembering what he d forgotten to tell her i never had any siblings which was why i was so pleased when i met you i always wanted a family i grew up with our aunt and uncle and our cousin dudley and they never treated me like family you mean our muggle aunt and uncle erin asked in surprise and harry nodded i ve not seen them for years they re awful how did you survive i dontknow harry whispered suddenly feeling self conscious i guess i was never treated with love so i never missed it i never got toys or treats so i never expected them i was lonely but i didntknow any different oh harry erin said with an understanding gasp and pulled harry into a tight hug you never played games or had hobbies i was lucky if they remembered to feed me harry chuckled as erin pulled away my bedroom was the cupboard under the stairs i had to do all the cooking and cleaning in the house i went to school in dudley old clothes and got picked on by dudley gang i never had any friends that madness erin exclaimed ludicrous true harry stated i was pretty lonely until i got taken to hogwarts and told i was a famous wizard famous erin laughed not that it much difference here harry sighed wrapping his arms around himself absorbed in his own little world not listening to erin at all i cantremember mum and dad he said simply not at all i dontknow if i ll even recognize them well if you don t i ll point them out erin smiled warmly and you ll have plenty of time to get to know them over christmas then when we get back to school i trust it will perhaps be time to tell dumbledore your story harry looked up it was as if she was reading his mind yeah he nodded wearily picking himself up off the dusty ground i so glad you believe me i was worried that someone would figure it out but you seem to understand well that because i ve known for ages erin explained standing too and about hermione ron and ginny what harry asked how d you know about them too i didntmention it i thought i no no you didn t erin insisted trying to put harry mind at rest but it pretty obvious well to me at least i dontunderstand harry said rocking his head in his hands how is it possible for you to guess that we re different i didnteven know about ginny till the other day well i had a hunch erin smiled i ve been thinking it over for a while you of course are the most different but you have reason to be i mean no doubt hermione and ron arentunder the same amount of stress as you what that got do anything harry asked reaching for the doorknob it got to do with everything harry erin chuckled you surely dontthink that i just thought this all up do you i just had a lucky guess i not that smart harry well then how did you know harry questioned feeling deprived i can read auras erin spoke clearly you know the thin mist of color which surrounds our bodies and reflects how we feel from the moment you got here i knew that you werentmy old brother your aura was so dark and dingy and harry was always bright green or blue so that why i tried to question you just to be sure your aura wasntplaying tricks on me that the only way you could tell harry questioned somewhat intrigued that the only way i needed erin shrugged i just noticed it so i kept an eye on you aura dontjust change like that hermione and ron aura changes were more subtle so i didntpick up on them for a few weeks it wasntuntil i saw them together that i realized people who are in love have much richer auras when they re together and hermione and ron had nothing not until a few weeks ago you got this all from an aura harry asked you learnt this in divination hermione will be horrified i do hope so erin grinned she doesntunderstand divination one bit her aura is one of the thinnest i ve seen in a while and what about ginny harry asked eagerly how did you know it took a while erin admitted she did a pretty good job being our ginny they re impossible to tell apart by mannerisms and looks and ginny aura was so similar to my ginny s they both bear a deep purple which means harry asked desperately unhappy but somewhat content erin said with a thinking face often lonely too just generally unhappy it difficult to explain you just know why was your ginny unhappy harry asked confused she has everything she popular rich beautiful carefree what more can you want she wants love erin said simply casting her eyes away from harry s wasntthe other harry good enough harry asked grabbing erin arm and bringing her back to life harry always asked her out he loved her just not the way she wanted him too erin sighed he isntlike you harry you re sweet which is why your ginny falling for you no she not harry mumbled kicking a stone across the ground believe what you want erin smiled i not going to try and persuade you harry strolled to the door again and took the handle so what colors my aura now harry asked testingly erin paused for a moment and gazed almost unnoticeable around the outside of harry head a soft gray blue and it clearing erin said lightly i wish i could say the same for dean why what wrong with him asked harry i wish i knew erin said with a sigh and a shake of her head look lets go to bed harry directed can we meet tomorrow morning before quidditch i ve got about a million things to ask you but now not the time we need to go to bed it late you re so responsible erin mocked laughing keeping to the rules a proper little hero dad would be so proud the last remark hit harry squarely in the heart and he finally turned the door handle to reveal a foggy corridor come erin harry muttered gruffly and she followed a beautiful bright sky opened sunday with a supple shower of rain a gentle breeze graced the school grounds as harry trod towards the quidditch pitch hey harry a vibrant voice called from behind him harry waited and erin ran to his side with a click of quidditch boots hi he half smiled upon her arrival thought you were going without me erin said looking distantly across the grounds as they walked of course not harry sighed leading them across to a grassy stretch to the left of their destination it nice now the snow gone erin mumbled towing the mud up with her left foot pretty unusual though it usually keeps until christmas still it better for quidditch erin harry said stopping dead still what re mum and dad like i mean really like they re nice erin smiled elegaricly fun strict but fair no i mean harry stumbled staring to walk again does mum cook does dad play quidditch with us do they help us with homework do they still love each other mum cooks well erin began she can make all sorts cakes and cookies with sugar icing and sprinkles which are wonderful she cooks dinner which we eat between 5 and 6 except for at the weekend when dad cooks erin took a seat upon a large rock and harry followed suit listening carefully to every word dad always takes us out to play quidditch over christmas erin smiled we ve got a field out the back of our house where we play and he the one who taught you how to fly they always help us with our homework mum wont give us the answers but dad often digs out old essays for us to copy and yes they love each other very much harry wiped a hand across his aching forehead and heaved a sigh they love you harry erin said putting a hand on his knee just wait until christmas i going to have to harry mused standing up briskly anything else you want to know in particular erin asked mind you you ll probably just pick things up as you go along i s pose harry said starting absentmindedly towards the quidditch pitch i mean erin said i could try and tell you everything but no doubt there d be things that i d miss dontworry harry mumbled looking out at the quidditch stadium there dean erin cheered and harry spotted him and seamus going into the changing rooms you really like him dontyou harry asked looking into erin sparkling eyes yeah erin said blushing things are going pretty good between us i think you think harry questioned his auras been a little darker then usual over the past few days erin explained and sometimes when i speak to him he seems a little distant you should ask him what on his mind harry said i will erin chirped as soon as i get the chance good harry stated as they reached the changing rooms now lets get ready for the match rain began to pour as the last few members of the team arrived i am drenched ron complained loudly shaking the water off like a dog oh stop complaining daisy said darkly as she rung the water from her dusty blonde hair i love the rain ginny smiled flicking her wet locks behind her so refreshing ron and daisy growled at her now now children erin grinned meeting harry eyes erin right harry chuckled go change before i give you your pointless team pep talk the three wet ones trailed away and erin took a seat next to dean perfect weather eh seamus sighed we haventhad practice in rain like this before this is nothing harry insisted casting his eyes to the window but we can still do it we ll just have to try and make the game as short as possible you two seamus exclaimed after turning away from the window and shielding his eyes harry turned to see erin and dean pulling apart from a kiss do you have to do that in here seamus said before covering harry eyes there are children in here shut up seamus harry struggled and dean gave them a feeble laugh all set ginny questioned fully dressed in her uniform that was quick harry pointed out with a smile someone eager to fly absolutely ginny insisted and harry watched her smiling as she skipped away to the mirror erin shook her finger at him and gave him a knowing grin before making her way over to ginny erin harry said in warning trying to stop erin path but she ignored him ginny do you think you could do my hair for me erin asked teasing harry so that it wont get in my way during the match sure ginny said putting down her own comb i could put it into two french plaits perfect erin smiled and the two approached the bench i ll sit here ginny said taking a seat next to harry and you can sit on the floor in front of me erin did as was ordered and ginny began her hair so ginny erin smiled evilly have you ever sent a valentine to anyone harry cringed remembering that he hadnttold the others about erin and suddenly wishing that he hadnttold erin absolutely everything no ginny said quietly are you sure erin asked checking that dean and seamus were out of earshot not even when you were a first year never ginny said going red in the face so you ve never sent anyone chocolates erin asked falsely or a card or a singing valentine ginny sat oddly still her eyes chancing an embarrassed peek at harry before erin burst out laughing what ginny asked naively she knows harry said warmly resting a hand on ginny lower back she found out about us and ron and hermione so i told her everything everything erin chuckled all about voldemort ginny dropped one of her plaits in shock of the name as ron and daisy sauntered into the room daisy ginny called with a new found grin could you finish plaiting erin hair for me no problem daisy smiled preening her own hair which was lined with careful twists and up tight in a ponytail ginny rushed over to ron and whispered hurriedly into ron ear he exchanged a look between erin and harry before saying quite clearly cool indeed erin grinned widely and suddenly the entire atmosphere changed it was as if the barrier between the two worlds had been raised harry suddenly felt more at ease then he had done in years right harry beamed standing up pep talk dean and seamus joined daisy on the bench and ginny and ron lent against the wall we can do this harry said we all know we can lets just go out there and prove that we re the best team lets do it erin cheered are you all ready harry asked checking each face in turn just a moment i need to do my hair ginny said and twirled her rich locks up into a perfect bun within seconds all set then lets go never had harry enjoyed flying more before this game hufflepuff were no competition harry had tried not to catch the snitch on several occasions just because he didntwant the game to end it seemed a shame to harry that hufflepuff werentenjoying the exercise as much as gryffindor were even though it was raining and freezing cold there was a warm friendly heat between his team which was unbeatable ginny for one had scored some impossible goals without even batting an eyelid after a close call where the hufflepuff seeker had nearly caught the snitch harry decided to get down to business and there potter goes the commentator had shouted as harry made a final dive and just a minute harry got the snitch gryffindor wins harry took a grand victory lap before flying to the center of the field and throwing the snitch up into the grizzly air with triumph ginny was flying above harry and without any notice she simply kicked her leg over and dropped from her broomstick and fell perfectly onto harry one good game she grinned her chocolate eyes open wide are you alright harry questioned as ginny breathed heavily fine ginny cheered electricity running through her veins just amazed that game was prefect that because you scored so many perfect goals harry exclaimed with enthusiasm you were on fire ginny threw herself into harry arm for a big thank you hug but unfortunately this caused harry to loose his balance and the pair tumbled graciously through the air in each others arms a few meters from the ground they stopped both entangled together and found dumbledore standing before them congratulations he smiled but next time do try and be more careful when celebrating with a flick of his wand harry and ginny fell effortlessly to the ground and burst out laughing the kind of laughter which lasts for hours they laughed and laughed and before they knew it the sky was getting dark we d better head in harry said watching the stars begin to settle harry was laying on his back with one hand behind his head and the other arm round ginny ginny laid snuggled beside him with her head resting on his chest i s pose ginny yawned i bet they re still celebrating we ought to make an appearance harry said but make no action to move yeah we should ginny agreed slowly sitting up she took the band from her rich red hair and let it cascade generously down her back harry watched the different tones and highlights as they glittered in the early moons gaze harry sat shiftily up and followed ginny chocolate eyes out to the stars the stars were beautiful harry recognized yet they seemed to hold no glimmer compared to ginny eyes ginny turned to harry who made no effort to look away he kept his eyes strongly fixed on hers and the magic within them what ginny asked sweetly in an innocent non accusing tone nothing harry said looking serious yet sincere he raised a hand to ginny cheek making a decision as he did and began to lean in a crashing noise caused ginny and harry to jump apart with a look they noticed a shifty figure in the outskirts of the quidditch pitch who on further inspection could be recognized as dean what he ginny murmured and harry leapt to his feet and offered his hand ginny took it and together they ventured back to the changing room hey where have you two been seamus called above the party noise when harry and ginny got inside just out on the field harry explained then added talking that my boy seamus grinned cheekily slapping harry on the shoulder come on seamus daisy shouted marching over we need to get some more butterbeer it out the back seamus replied as they marched away harry and ginny made their way through the heavy deafening crowd over to the remaining team members and hermione who were deep in conversation hey ron cheered hey harry grinned back where have you been he asked thunderously finishing the last of his butterbeer you d better not have been messing around with my sister leave them alone ron hermione insisted loudly slapping ron shoulder they can do what they like we ve just been talking ginny explained over the noisy volumes us too ron shouted hermione knows that erin knows harry erin asked then raised her voice to be heard have you seen dean he was outside harry explained then signaled that they should go once outside erin and harry found that the heavens had opened again damn erin cursed running her hands through her newly dried hair lets me walk you harry said lightly over the soft humming of the rain dontworry erin said shaking her head no i coming harry insisted its too late for you to walk outside alone harry suddenly has visions of erin coming across blaise gang in the dark but it raining erin said i dontcare harry stated taking a step to his right he went this way the pair walked silently through the wet potent gloom they strolled round the outskirts of the pitch and past the stands assuming that dean had gone back to the castle erin led harry in that direction and harry followed aimlessly before erin came to a sharp halt underneath an oak tree beside the lake stood two intertwined figures erin marched at top speed towards them with fire in her stride until one of the figures pulled away erin dean said in shock looking like he d just seen a ghost sky stood beside him brushing her hair elegantly from her face erin stood still in silence and harry was expecting her to blow up at dean with the passion he d seen her have so many times but she didn t she gave each guilty face an aching look before bursting onto tears and flooding from the scene how sad now review a n just a quick note this is an in between chapter so you know where it at the ball is ever nearing of course so i ve just got a few more things that have to happen before hand so give

fluff and drama so get reading always angel chapter 30 one million things harry woke up early in the morning to find himself sitting on a particularly uncomfortable chair in the middle of a girls dormitory the events of the previous night slowly came back to him and he turned to check on erin erin was sleeping in warm peach flannel pajamas and wrapped up in a cocoon of pastel colored blankets her face was still red from crying the night before but her thick cinnamon hair had had the courtesy to stay neat harry rose tiredly from his chair and took a look at the other occupants of the room a bed along from erin was daisy sleeping like a baby her blonde hair was up in two messy buns and she rested peacefully in a long pop art pink night dress with a smiling teddy bear in her arms in the next bed was mitzi who harry knew very little wearing a blue silk dressing gown and clumps of smooth dark hair in the bed across from her was skye skye slept smugly in red chinese style pajamas her normally perfect blonde hair was curling wispily from the heat and her skin was shiny and imperfect it made harry smile dean would have been better off with erin he said simply before moving to the last bed ginny slept soundlessly her powder freckles glowed against her pale white skin and her long red hair sat perfectly in waves she wore an old fashioned night gown which was white with long puffed sleeves and a cute buttoned collar she looked like an angel harry took a picture of her in his mind which he hoped he d keep forever for he was sure he d never see something so perfect in his life again harry spent most of the morning alone he haunted the corridors looking for adventure he tried to broaden his mind with knowledge but found the library quite unappealing sometime before lunch harry made his was back to the common room hoping for a pleasant game of chess or a friendly conversation by the fire he had no such luck have you seen dean was erin first question when he got inside no i haven t harry said soothingly and forget about him i think he avoiding you harry daisy explained nobody seen him all morning they say he gone into hiding that stupid harry said he one of my best friends well that what misty said daisy insisted as she put an arm around erin and she food friends with skye who you know i know harry said through gritted teeth look erin go outside go get your broomstick and fly this out daisy go to misty and tell her to mind her own business the two girls trooped off in separate directions and harry slumped into a seat by the fire hi harry ginny chirped as she sat down beside him how erin she alright i suppose harry said restlessly watching the flames jump in the fireplace she hurting though i told her to have some time by herself sort her head out oh ginny sighed because i ve been talking to skye in our dorm room and she worried about what you and erin think she didntwant to upset erin you see she just likes dean a lot well tell her that i not angry with anyone despite popular belief harry grumbled and tell her that she hurt erin and an apology would be much appreciated she ll find erin on the quidditch pitch thanks harry ginny grinned before heading to the stairs you re a star harry closed his eyes lightly trying to help the aching go away he d been up half the night comforting erin and was now paying for his lack of sleep luckily all students apart from prefects had the morning off to do as they pleased as a meeting was being held to discuss the plans for the ever nearing christmas ball harry keeled over on the sofa and composed a large yawn harry ron voice raged and harry sat up straight malfoy is going to die ron stalked across the common room and stood directly in front of the fire harry was admiring guess what happened in the meeting ron asked with anger flowing freely a hippogriff ate snape harry said hopefully no ron stormed malfoy our great and admired head boy put everybody into mixed house groups to work on things for the stupid christmas ball so i working with some hufflepuff which i can live with but guess who the stupid blond prat put himself with hermione harry stated dully exactly ron said searing with anger he got a thing for her it so obvious you know harry said he could ve just put himself and hermione together because they re head boy and girl what difference does it make ron shouted scaring a few passing 2nd years he likes her ron why do you care so much harry muttered and pulled ron to sit down you and hermione arentreally together if you remember rightly but what if we were ron asked he cantsteal my girlfriend from me and hermione cantbe with him he not good enough for her i thought you liked him the other day harry mumbled closing his eyes you said we should ask him to hang out more well that before i found out he was a girlfriend stealer ron exclaimed ron harry said seriously go to the quidditch pitch do some flying and cool off then come back here with an open mind and i ll see what i can do ron grabbed his cloak gruffly and stormed out of the room just as daisy came back in misty wont be bothering us again daisy smiled i passed dean on the way over too he was about to go outside and apologize to erin which seems like a wise plan of action if you ask me shit harry cursed i just sent skye over there to apologize we cantleave all three of them together hey ginny smiled coming into the common room i just left skye to troop over to erin by herself those two just need to get it out in the open problem harry stated ginny go outside and get dean on his way to the quidditch pitch convince him to come to the library with you to discuss quidditch plans daisy could you please go and find ron at quidditch pitch and tell him to go to the room of requirement at the beginning of lunch or all hells going to set loose right both girls chorused harry jumped up from his seat with a plan formed in his head and missioned it straight to the library inside he spotted draco and hermione sitting at the back behind a desk covered with parchment plans harry neville said shyly as he walked around the nearest bookshelf have you seen my sister yeah she ll be back from the quidditch pitch in about 20 minutes harry explained before remembering neville could you do me a favor in about two minutes could you come over to the desk at the back and distract draco ask him something about the ball or homework he in my charms class neville suggested perfect harry settled i owe you big time hey draco and hermione smiled upon harry arrival good morning harry draco said pleasantly rolling up some parchment what brings you to the library hermione questioned suspiciously just bored harry said convincingly swinging his arms by his sides why dontyou get some sleep hermione suggested seamus told me that you didntreturn to your common room last night you must be exhausted or you can sit and brainstorm with us if you like draco asked with a smile we re trying to list all the things that need to be done before the ball so that we can assign jobs and monitors that a good idea hermione said brightly you re bound to think of something we ve forgotten draco the nervous voice of neville shook i was wondering if you could help me i struggling with that charms essay and i know you ve already handed yours in so i d be more then happy to help draco said as enthusiastically as he could muster but i kind of busy right now no problem hermione insisted packing up her things we can come back to this later lunch starts in 10 minutes anyway talking of lunch harry said leaning casually on the table ginny mentioned something about wanting to meet you in the room of requirement then she said she had a girly problem and she wouldnttell me what hermione nodded knowingly and started to leave oh and if you happen to pass any of the marauders harry called to her tell them to be in the common room at the end of lunch hermione signaled that she d heard and left through the library door just moments before dean and ginny came through it ginny our next quidditch match isntfor ages dean vowed you dontneed to worry yet hi harry ginny grinned mischievously have you seen daisy she meeting with neville harry told her they re probably in the great hall is that were seamus is yeah dean said gruffly clearing his voice well could you pass on a message to seamus for me gin harry asked tiredly so ginny didntobject tell him to be in the common room at the end of lunch but i going to the common room now not the great hall ginny sighed i ll only do it if you promise me you ll get a good nights sleep tonight harry you took tired i swear harry yawned and ginny floated away so down to business i brought you here to discuss erin look mate i sorry dean said honestly i just like skye too what am i supposed to do be fair and tell erin the truth harry affirmed you really upset her i know dean sighed just give me a break i ll sort it out good harry said go apologize now you ll find erin wondering aimlessly around the quidditch pitch if not check the skies tell her you want to go to the ball as friends and bring her some flowers then meet me in the common room at the end of lunch sorted dean decided and rushed out harry decided that now would be a good time to break for lunch and started to journey towards the great hall unfortunately he never made it ron you are insufferable hermione screeched down the corridor who do you think you are who does he think he is ron shouted back you re supposed to be my girlfriend not his but theres nothing going on between us that not what it looks like to me stop harry charged and stomped over to them dangerously you two are making a scene and today i donthave the patience to deal with it ron and hermione both sniffed indignantly ron go to the great hall and eat lunch with seamus harry ordered hermione go to the common room and eat with ginny now the two of them headed hastily in opposite directions and harry stumbled away feeling more tired then ever he sneaked some food from the kitchens on his way past too tired to socialize in the great hall for lunch then wondered back across the entrance hall as predicted dean and erin appeared perhaps 5 minutes later both smiling sadly erin clutching a bunch of lilies dean gave harry the thumbs up and harry went wandering again he made his way to the common room by the end of lunch and fell heavily into his favorite chair his fellow marauders arrived only moments later so why did you want to meet us here seamus asked as they all crowded around harry opened his tired eyes and curled his mouth into a grin before replying i think it time to discuss out end of year prank now review lets reach 600 reviews before the ball chapter go team a n sorry i didntupdate as quickly as i thought but i got busy lol last chapter was kind of a in between sort out the story chapter but this ones right back on track this chapter is great but the next

review for the last chapter i know the last chapter was messy though so i wont take it to heart enough of my rambling go read this chapter what are you waiting for angel chapter 31 christmas messages harry woke up on tuesday morning with a smile on his face he leapt out of bed with vigor and hummed a made up tune in his head as he looked for his school uniform it was only when ron made a growling noise that harry realized he was singing out load so he changed swiftly and sped from the dormitory you re in a good mood this morning ginny cheered as harry paced through the common room nope i in a fantastic mood harry exclaimed making a particularly small first year jump harry arrived in the great hall at just the right time a small group of girls had just vacated the gryffindor table and left a seat right next to erin which harry gladly took nice to see you up and about today harry said in greeting picking up some toast and erin returned it with a smile ball tomorrow i know erin replied stabbing drearily at her fried egg how could i forget harry was about to reply with something comforting when he spotted something unusual there was someone sitting at the slytherin table who wasnta slytherin someone who if ron found them there was likely to get into a blazing row hermione harry said softly tapping her on the shoulder can i have a word sure hermione replied airily causing pansy to give her a characteristic scowl will you excuse me draco harry took hermione to one side you know ron going to flip harry stated crossing his arms i quite aware of that hermione said loftily let him flip do you have to do ball planning in the middle of the slytherin table harry asked almost pleadingly if you hadntnoticed the ball tomorrow hermione said patronizingly throwing a look towards her notes again i know harry whined but cantyou do you re planning in the library or something somewhere where ron wont know no hermione said harshly draco in the middle of his breakfast let ron get mad at me see if i care but hermione i think ron needs to get all his anger issues and feelings out in the open so maybe he can figure out what annoying him so much hermione argued we cantspend our whole lives contemplating our every action and avoid a perfectly acceptable situation just incase ron blows up harry nodded his head solemnly yet somehow having the feeling that hermione was getting at something deeper then ron anger issues harry wandered aimlessly back to gryffindor table and took his seat next to erin again watching hermione and draco from a distance harry could see why ron was getting so mad there was a certain comfort between the pair the kind of comfort harry felt when sitting alone with ginny which must have unsettled in ron head the feelings which he didnthave for hermione a few moments before the bell was due to go the lazy marauders strolled into the great hall causing commotion catastrophe and most of all laughter morning all dean cheered as he threw a small red object into the air which went bang and showered the hall with holiday glitter merry christmas all seamus sang dragging forward a big green sack mooneyclaus has come to town merry christmas ron added searching innocently around the hall for hermione harry assumed seamus was now taking stripy candy canes from his bag and golden ginger bread men and scattering them to all the students with his wand ron gave up his search and began to use a nifty charm to glue mistletoe to the walls not enough of that stuff around seamus grinned pointing to a piece of mistletoe which ron was pinning to the arched doorway hey let me help harry shouted and the whole hall seemed to turn his way prongs the other three marauders chorused as harry ran forward i ve got an idea harry explained and summoned his broomstick to him with a smile as it floated mystically into the great hall students around him spoke in ewe before harry jumped atop it and flew upwards it was odd for harry being so close to the ceiling of the great hall which today showed a frosty blue sky somehow he had the urge to fly up into the clouds above but had the feeling that he might hit his head harry flew sideways to the largest banner which he could find it was black hung over the teachers table and wore the school emblem but not for long have a cracking christmas and a naughty new year from the marauders seamus recited picturing the poster in his head you took the words right out of my mouth that was just brilliant prongs in a league of its own dean grinned nice contribution yeah and that sealing charm seamus added now our christmas greeting will be hanging above the teachers heads forever in red green and gold dean grinned and the boys burst out laughing have any of you seen hermione ron asked searching frantically round the classroom with his eyes no mate seamus said shaking his head plainly you two are going through a rough patch arentyou just dump her if she being a pain and come back to being single and free like the rest of us dean suggested with passion we always said we didntneed long term girlfriends you were the one who changed that ron doesnthave to make that kind of decision now harry said before ron could start maybe this thing will work itself out it has too ron mumbled inaudibly harry knew he was right after christmas when harry ron hermione and ginny left and their other selves came back all the things which uncharacteristically changed could cause a great deal of drama and dilemma to the real occupants of this world hermione and ron had to stay just that good morning class mcgonagall said addressing the students sternly today in recognition of mr potters wonderful transfigured art work at breakfast this morning we will be creating christmas banners rock on seamus cheered into the silence and several students laughed exactly my point mr finnegan mcgonagall smiled fondly so turn to page 342 and work your way through after transfiguration the marauders had potions which was just as enjoyable as the last lesson instead of brewing a potion to cure hiccups as they had planned to do sirius decided to set an unscheduled task this lesson we re all going to be brewing muggle beer sirius announced with bright enthusiasm alright dean exclaimed punching a fist into the air five mugs of toxic beer later somewhere sirius made a mistake in the instructions harry tumbled quite happily out of class now that christmas spirit seamus beamed harry sirius called from the doorway just reminding you that your parents will meet you at the station on friday i ve been asked to try to remind you on the train trip home as well so you dontaccidentally forget and end up flying home again and getting spotted by muggles like you did last year sirius gave harry an admiring grin which harry returned flying from the station and getting seen by muggles that something he d never do the rest of the morning was filled with nothingness for harry he did nothing purposeful unless you count spreading christmas cheer with the help of peeves of course peeves was great fun he even taught the marauders a very crude version of jingle bells as they set up the exploding gift boxes outside the slytherin common room it was during lunchtime when the marauders were evaluating the morning hard work that ron again realized that he hadntseen hermione so where is she ron questioned looking up and down the gryffindor table from his seat she probably just out and about doing ball things harry said chancing a sideways look at the slytherin table hermione was there but how many things can there be to do ron stressed pouring himself some pumpkin juice she already assigned all the prefects jobs tomorrow she got all day off while we work i sure she just busy harry said picking at his quiche busy with him ron growled brutally dismantling his pasty look she going to the ball with you harry sighed what more do you want i want her away from him ron spat with pure hatred he needs to keep his filthy hermione ron sprung from his seat like an electric pulse had just been charged through him and marched to the slytherin table good afternoon ron hermione said in a delicate tone oh hi ron draco smiled at the red heads fiery face i glad you came over i thought that maybe we could go out flying later hermione thought it would be a good idea over my dead body ron exclaimed if you insist hermione replied sinisterly maybe i should go sit ron and hermione chorused at draco hey harry said firmly as he approached i think you two need to cool off oh stop trying to be such a relationship guru hermione strained reaching the end of her tether yeah because your not very good at it ron insulted throwing daggers at harry now what is your problem ronald hermione blazed a little more civially why does it bother you so much that i spending time with draco it not that you re spending time with him it why ron explained the flush on his face deepening we have work ron work hermione insisted talking down to him work you have to do sitting at his house table ron asked or in the astronomy tower the back of the library the rose gardens for merlin sake i didntknow there were rose gardens blaise mumbled from across the table exactly ron stressed waving his arms about drastically but draco chose all those places hermione thought aloud i dontunderstand seems pretty obvious to me pansy muttered and was followed by sniggers look i think me and draco need to have a little chat ron said threateningly through gritted teeth wizard to wizard draco paled slightly at the idea silence fell no hermione said forcefully taking a step closer to ron and hiding draco from view protectively i afraid me draco have things to do later in fact we re busy right up until the ball you ll have to wait until after fine ron said the word getting stuck coldly in his throat gradually the slytherin began to fumble away mumbling like soft thunder draco quickly packed his parchment up before hermione led him out of the hall by her hand almost as if she was protecting a small child ron sat on the empty wooden table and broke harry sauntered over watching ron wrap his face in his hands dontworry harry said comfortingly it only hermione give her a few hours and she ll be back to normal that was brilliant seamus cheered as he and dean ran over you really told them i reckon blaise will be asking you to join his i hate malfoys club soon dean chuckled but still that was impressive i wouldnthave stood up to you the way you were gritting your teeth you looked like you were about to snap his head off and chuck it at someone tempting ron said with a scratchy voice come on harry mused lessons have started we ve got snape so i suggest we make a move since when did you care about being late for lessons dean asked since i dontwant detention through the ball harry explained pulling ron to his feet now come on the afternoon lessons went slowly and there was no sign of hermione and draco yet this didntseem to improve ron mood at all ron simply sat stewing for hours over the lunch time meeting not listening to a word any teacher said when snape asked him what you would get if you brewed pixies blood with choligaw root he said quite indignantly seven it just no good ron growled on the way out of their last lesson i cantget it out of my head the way she speaks to him and protects him why does she protect him probably because no one else will harry said surely and ron shook his head you know what hermione like she bought that monster of a cat crookshanks because she thought he was lonely and rejected she has a club to support house elves the creatures which nobody seems to care about she always looks after the less fortunate draco has no parents and a brother and sister to bring up hermione just wants to make things better for him you know he could definitely do with a friend a friend but not a girlfriend ron stated if you ask me he pushing his luck hermione wont let anything happen harry said as they descended the stairs i sure she knows what she doing she not so na ve that she wouldntnotice if someone liked her ron mumbled something inaudible as the boys rounded the corner hermione just hermione harry said trying to convince ron hermione kind caring and beautiful which is why i donttrust him ron said honestly that viktor krum already had his dirty hands over her but from now on people need to watch their step you sound like an overprotective brother harry smiled either that or you re jealous shut up harry ron grunted sorry ron but as i ve already taken up the space of protective older brother harry mused i d say that makes you the jealous one protective older brother you re almost a year younger than her you dontknow anything harry ron complained shaking his head somewhat mournfully really harry asked putting a hand on ron shoulder really trust me ron ordered shaking off harry hand why should i get jealous i have no reason i just dontthink draco good enough for her and neither is viktor krum harry asked with a raised eyebrow even though he a rich gentlemanly quidditch player no he not good enough what about seamus no way dean after what he did to erin right me ron stopped and looked harry squarely in the eyes harry he said as if he was trying his hardest to squeeze the words out of of course you re g good enough so i have your full permission to ask hermione out harry smirked err yes ron said then exhaled loudly that killed you didntit oh yeah as harry and ron paced down the stairs which came out into the entrance hall they spotted hermione standing outside alone just as ron opened his mouth to shout a warm greeting to her draco stepped out of the great hall by her side ron stood dead still as draco smiled and said something of a goodbye to hermione before giving her a kiss on the cheek hermione smiled and wandered off innocently towards gryffindor tower that it ron huffed his eyes as dark as the night he dead ron stomped loudly down the stairs with his once gigantic feet then raged to draco side with his hands balled into tight white fists what do you think you re doing ron raged signaling to the direction which hermione had just left in what malfoy asked softly his pale face looking even paler and pinched then usual hermione ron explained what right do you have to kiss her i was just saying goodbye well don t ron shouted and a few people poked their heads around the great hall doors i didntmean to upset you draco said stated his face balmy in discomfort as he backed away a little upset me ron laughed sourly i angry not upset ferret boy what are you talking about draco asked looking suddenly confused ferret boy i d think of a better insult if i were you weasel that was it ron hit draco round the head and students poured to the scene leave him alone a popular hufflepuff girl yelled what did he ever do to you a girl harry recognized as misty shouted harry jumped out of his reverie and pushed his way through the crowds come on ron he said gruffly putting a hand on his best friends shoulder lets go no ron said glaring at harry i not finished and neither am i draco said slowly cupping his bruised chin before he swung into ron stomach the red head keeled slightly over looking winded before recovering and shoving draco to the floor ron ginny shouted frantically someone get him out of here oi ron seamus cheered kick him in the coco pops draco tripped ron to the floor and before anyone could anticipate it they were rolling around punches flying everywhere go weasley blasie shouted bet you wish you d let me finish him off now he pretty strong pansy said from behind him look ron harry said clutching onto his wand in his pocket but panic had risen over him he didntknow what to do boys a gentle voice gasped and the crowd parted so that hermione could make her way through hermione both draco and ron chorused as they sprang apart and scrambled to their feet draco i asked you to avoid any arguments that might occur hermione said sadly and i thought d you d know better then to solve your problems with violence ron both boys stood wearily with their arms tied guiltily behind their backs and their heads bowed as to avoid her icy gaze hermione harry hushed over the silence shall we leave it she said in a gritty voice on the urge of tears i ve had enough and with that hermione began to walk away hermione ron called his voice echoing through the hall i only protecting you well i dontneed protecting she called back but he got a thing for you ron yelled and the crowd tensed hermione she carried on walking and as soon as she was out of sight ron jumped on draco again this time over the jeering harry found that both parties were groaning with pain harry signaled for dean and seamus to get closer just as ron got draco into a headlock tell me the truth ron demanded do you like hermione yes draco said in a raspy voice as he tried to get his breath back you fancy her ron questioned thunderly yes draco yelled now let me go have you asked her to the ball ron persisted and the crowd was making a riot no draco answered tell me the truth ron ordered holding draco tighter i am i haventasked her draco said breathing faster i ve got a date and anyway she far too in love with you to care about me ron dropped draco half out of shock and half out of ignorance fine ron said blandly i done all over seamus shouted signaling to the crowd nothing to see dean called dismissing the other side of the group draco wiped wet blood from eye brow before hobbling away in the direction of the dungeons daisy followed his path despondently before turning to ron you really have some nerve daisy said pointing dangerously at ron and the crime scene of course he already got a date you would have found that out if you d only asked sooner i asked him to the ball weeks ago and he said he was already going with someone why would you fancy him ron questioned wiping away the sweat because he sweet and romantic and actually very cute daisy whined before stomping away ron massaged his aching arm before turning to the other silent marauders and saying simply that went well harry left ron at the bottom of the girls staircase some forty minutes later ron was convinced that he was going to stay there until hermione stopped ignoring his shouting and came down to talk to him harry knew he d probably only last about 10 minutes alone but he d enjoy the peace and quite while he could harry threw on his jumbled mismatched pajamas and hung out of the window to take a long swig of winter night air he liked to watch the tranquil grounds of hogwarts as they calmed him somewhat but he found that he often forgot to in the evenings he couldntreally remember what had put him into the habit of gushing out of the window for he didntdo it at his hogwarts he supposed it was something to do with the grounds here the grass always looked so soft and the trees appeared to be in gentle slumber something caught harry eye by the edge of the forest something harry hadntseen for sometime and someone harry hadntseen for sometime an angel robed in pure white rode on the back of a perfect white unicorn they were difficult to miss even though it was dark as their white attire almost glowed harry didnteven question their purpose for a moment but merely watched them as they galloped into the trees he stayed watching for a while trying to remember the last time he d seen that girl before harry knew all to well that unicorns roamed the grounds of the forest but this particular girl he didntsee so often he wondered if she was possibly a ghost yet she looked so solid harry sat for hours awaiting her departure hours and hours if she was a human she couldntsurvive out in the cold for too long it was a windy winters night she couldntbe too much longer as the sun began to rise filtering the sky with light beams harry tiredly scanned the forest she was nowhere in sight maybe she d made it past him there was no way of knowing just as harry was about to give up a figure trotting through the trees caught his gaze it was a unicorn a white unicorn spotted with glitter and a long golden mane and tail from what harry knew this told him that she was verging on adulthood he knew it was a she as she was so beautiful the unicorn leapt through the gardens effortlessly and skimmed the edge of the lake before floating out of sight harry sighed collapsing onto his bed he wished he had her energy reviews would be nice right now next chapter we make a breakthrough but i cant post it untill ive heard your opinions on this chapter so review a n woohoo reviews are rolling in thank you all so much before we even begin i love this chapter it the day of the ball and everythings happening sorry i haventbeen answering all your questions but i lazy i ll try to do a few now how did harry go up to the girls dorm with the stairs etc come on he not the boy who lived for nothing see this chapter why did harry make dean take erin to the ball after he upset her because dean cheated on erin just a few days before the ball and if they hadntgone together erin would have been left without a date dean could get another easily on short notice as he a marauder why dontyou put this story under h g instead of r hr because the first pairng mentioned was r hr it the only pairing which has kind of been there throughout and it will be the stringest pairing see this chapter exploding presents outside the slytherin common room just a prank thought it would be funny whats going on with the unicorn who is lupin other student where is hagrid canttell you lupin had two other now only one he back is there going to be anymore d hr as i a r hr shipper etc etc nope the almost non existant i kept it to a minimum d hr moments were ground work for one of the last few chapters does dumbledore know about the universe change does dumbledore know everything who

name brooke my 500 reviewer character she mentioned in this chapter and we meet her in the next she belongs to brooke and not me ok p hugs and smiles angel chapter 32 a different story harry got up around midday purely because he had too it was the day of the ball a day where girls ran around giggling boys worried about dancing and the marauders planned a kick ass party or so he d heard harry paced down to the common room after showering and changing to find it filled with activities girls were standing round the edge of the room in little splodges chatting animatedly boys were moving things in and out levitating red furniture to the sides and setting up blue tables in the middle seamus and dean seemed to be the leaders of the operation standing on desks and chairs ordering people to take bright boxes here and move paint pots there the room was a flurry of color harry had never seen anything like it that it dennis seamus called using his hands to direst the sound stack it on top of the others a little to the left dean said signaling to with his hands now back a little perfect morning harry shouted with a grin over the commotion prongs seamus and dean cheered and jumped from their stands decided to make an appearance seamus asked jokingly what time do you call this dean mocked slept in harry shrugged what ve i missed not a lot just been sorting out things for the after ball party seamus said gesturing to the grand array of color great harry hyped yeah dean agreed we ve got paints banners butterbeer and decorations now all we ve got to do is sort out those speakers we nicked from muggle studies we were hoping hermione could charm them but she not been around all morning hasntshe been helping in the great hall harry asked no that just prefects not the head boy and girl seamus said which is why we ve lost ron erin and that daft colin boy we could ve done with their help and she not in the library harry questioned she not left her dorm dean said or if she has she must have sneaked by us we ve been up since the break of day and where ginny harry asked not seen her either seamus sighed but down to business we ve still got to get the sweets from honeydukes and check the owls for that firewhisky ron brothers were sending us dean and seamus trekked to the center of the room and the troops of boys crowded round to hear the next plan of action you girls can help too you know seamus yelled signaling for them to join in harry walked past the cluster to the girls staircase put a no gravity spell on himself and floated easily up to a selected dorm room before his fellow marauders had time to notice his absence come in hermione called after harry had tapped on the door harry crept inside the silent dorm room and issued a simple hey hermione was sitting innocently on a chair by the window towards the back of the room she was snuggled up in a warm yellow daisy blanket and wearing baby blue towline pajamas her hair laid thick and bushy down her back and made harry smile oh it you hermione sighed i thought lavender and parvati were back nope just me harry sang throwing his arms out at his side and what brings you to my dormitory hermione asked absent mindedly gazing outside well i heard that you werentup yet and i know how unusual that is harry explained wandering towards her what up nothing hermione sighed fidgeting with her blanket just thinking about ron and draco and that ridiculous fight ah harry said and sat himself on the edge of the nearest bed well you cantsay you werentexpecting it i know but i still mad at him hermione growled who ron she humped scrunching up a fist of blanket in her rather tiny hand starting on draco like that after he helped him get out of that last scrape what was the point i should think ron did more damage to him then blaise he just picked an excuse for a fight because he quite clearly doesntlike draco but he does or did harry affirmed conversationally i mean he was the main one who fought blaise when we were in hogsmeade he seemed to really like draco and was suggesting hanging out with him more often before he showed an interest in you me what difference do i make hermione rambled her cheeks reddening on their own accord dontbe so na ve harry laughed you know what ron like if i didntknow better i might suggest that you did this whole thing with draco to make ron jealous well it a good job you do know me better then isntit hermione sniffed else you might have made quite a fool of yourself silence fell for a moment as hermione looked indignantly out of the window once more you know harry said softly ron only went for draco when he saw him kiss you on the cheek he couldnttake it he just exploded that because ron doesntunderstand hermione said crossing her arms just because he made a public show of affection doesntmean we re together in any way it doesntmean anything so it doesntmean anything when ron kisses you in the entrance hall harry asked seriously because your face tells a different story hermione lowered her head and rested her burning eyes in her comforter oh leave me alone she hollered i just wondered harry mumbled before changing the direction of the conversation so who draco ball date a girl from my dorm brooke hermione mourned turning her head to face harry she really nice she the one who been taking my place and doing all girly things with lav and pav while i ve been with you guys i dontthink they ve even noticed that it not me harry chuckled she pretty hmmmm hermione murmured and dead excited about going with draco although i think she d rather go with ron a date swap was suggested as a joke but i declined rather go with ron harry mused of course hermione smiled in a dreamy teenage way you and ron are so perfect for each other harry sighed as he got up from the creaky bed i thought that pensieve would be enough to make you two realize but i going back down to help with the party you should too good idea hermione yawned unwinding herself from her golden cocoon i know you and ron dontalways see eye to eye harry continued but promise me you wont give up on ron hermione gave harry a slightly confused look before nodding her head in acknowledgment good i know you like him even if you wont admit it harry grinned as he walked out of the dorm leaving a very stunned hermione dangerously alone with her own thoughts when harry emerged from the girls staircase he was met with a whirlwind of progress the once bare tables were now filled with great banners being painted by the artists of the house boxes were being opened and decorations discovered sweets cowered in great piles bottles chimed at every knock where d you go seamus asked from his prime painting position nowhere harry said watching a second year trip over a rather large box of fireworks just up to see hermione is she coming down yet seamus questioned because i have no idea how we re linking that muggle thing up to the radio dean seems to think we need to transfigure something into a dapta or something then do a swanky charm sounds about right harry nodded hands in his pockets when are the prefects finishing well we take a late lunch in about twenty minutes so i d say after that seamus assumed washing his brush hey prongs mooney dean shouted as he ran across the room decorations dangling from his hands guess what ex student i heard is returning to hogwarts for the ball no idea seamus shrugged try famous auror rubeus hagrid dean cheered you must be joking seamus exclaimed harry smiled things just couldntget any better after lunch with a very disgruntled ron a hyper active erin a smiling colin and every member of every other house no other house seemed to be host to a party harry made his way back to the common room with his rather irritable best friend i going to apologize but she better not moan at me ron grumbled stupidly kicking the stair as he went by and regretting it considerably afterwards she won t harry assured him in fact i ve spoken to her and she not as mad as she was last night just a little annoyed you can handle it i hope so ron sighed almost to himself i really want to go to the ball with her after much silent thinking time they entered the common room hermione stood authoritatively by a large muggle speaker dean and seamus making exaggerated helpful gestures at her side her hair was up in a curly ponytail and harry was glad to see she was out of her blue pajamas hermione ron called as he and harry passed quickly across the common room just a minute hermione said blandly giving her wand a few last flicks before a shining gold chord glowed between the speakers and the radio done it an artificial adaptor it should do for tonight ron ron stood singly feet rooted to the ground his large blue eyes suddenly looking at ill ease i just i just wanted ron stumbled and seamus and dean passed shifty looks i wanted to apologize hermione crossed her arms unforgivably see i got bothered because of you and draco which still bothers me ron tried to explain but the point is that i not mad at him any more i no longer mad at myself either and i was never mad at you so i hope we can just forget about this hermione tipped her head to one side and sighed like she always did and ron knew he was off the hook yet something was amiss look ron said sincerely taking hermione crossed arms down and holding her hands tightly i honestly sorry it was stupid of me i not just saying it so you ll forgive me i shouldnthave started that fight but it bothers me you and him bother me i cantstand it hermione please please dontkeep meeting him i cantabide it i cant stand seeing him hold your hand ron eyes were bright with sincerity which harry thought could never be matched hermione stood some would say blankly yet it was clear to harry that she was trying not to cry he lip quivered slightly as she bit it and adoration slowly came through her numbed features she let out a breath which no one knew she was holding and pulled ron unexpectedly into a hug it wasntstaged or predicted it was meaningful yet how much no one could tell hermione lent her head tiredly onto ron chest and ron held her close seamus and dean slowly looped away i mean it ron whispered his eyes tight closed not just as your fake boyfriend hermione didntanswer after a moment she pulled away with a slightly unusual look on her face it was like something didntadd up to her her deep brown eyes were more concentrated and contained something more then before something unreadable i going to go get ready hermione said never breaking eye contact with ron and harry wasntsure if she d heard herself speak the words had come out and she d barely moved her lips her gaze was fixed hermione turned her head suddenly and walked hastily to her dormitory ron stood dead still hermione harry sighed the one and only ron smiled inwardly to himself and it unintentionally reflected on his face tell me you fancy her harry grinned steadily ron laughed lightly scratching the back of his head with his hand come on lets go help ron replied and wandered off in the direction of seamus and dean hey harry chorused harry two favorite red headed girls with the addition of one blonde what you up to erin asked still helping with the party daisy mocked signaling to the surrounding mess no actually i harry started then something hit him where ve you been all day you re not a prefect you didnthave duty oh i was in the library daisy giggled very busy so what you mean is that you didntwant to help harry asked raising an eyebrow something like that daisy agreed hope you had fun come on erin said eagerly lets go get ready daisy and erin trailed away leaving ginny looking rather slight all on her own arentyou getting ready yet harry asked passing his weight from foot to foot almost nervously nah we ve got ages ginny insisted putting her hands on her hips in fact i was planning on a trip to riddle s i was supposed to help him tonight after all and i haventheard much from him for the last few days lets go then harry said uneasily ginny rapped on the history class door but was not met with a familiar welcome she hesitated catching harry eye unsurely before opening the door creak by creak who there a sharp voice demanded it just me ginny said sweetly and i brought harry we ve just popped by to say hi very well riddle voice replied endearingly with an imaginable smirk ginny lead harry inside the unusually dark murky classroom and harry cast his eyes upon the man hidden in the shadows suspiciously harry always saw the darkness of nighttime as a weakness he wished riddle would light the fire i afraid i in no state for a visit riddle said coldly slamming a suit case close with his thin white fingers are you going somewhere ginny asked innocently it was obvious he was under close inspection you could see roles of parchment laying around in piles and several half packed trunks his long black traveling cloak laid dustily over a chair yes he said menacingly his eyes bulging i leaving today and i wont be back riddle laughed atonally tossing into his trunk more of his possessions and both ginny and harry found themselves cringing where are you going ginny questioned softly never you mind riddle replied sucking in the adrenaline of the moment i going away from all these stupid children mudbloods squibs all of them i ll see them all in hell riddle slammed another trunk shut and pushed it aggressively out of his way are you feeling alright ginny asked taking a silent step forwards riddle snapped his head in ginny direction and harry pulled her back by the waist i ve never felt better riddle said softly in his usual fatherly tone but there was something perverted about it this time which churned harry up it time we go harry stated plainly blocking his mind so that nothing could get in his hands were still gripped tightly round ginny waist yeah she said falsing a childlike persona i need to get ready for the ball good bye good bye children riddle replied in a friendly yet bitter tone harry pushed ginny out first not letting go of her until they were out of the devils sight theres something wrong with him harry stated it not right i donttrust him i know ginny mumbled clinging anxiously to harry left sleeve he mad harry drabbled absolutely mad what are we supposed to do ginny asked wearily as they began to climb the stairs be glad he leaving i guess harry said unsurely do you think dumbledore will announce where he going at the ball ginny asked looking a little fearful still dumbledore and the professors are bound to bid him goodbye probably harry sighed taking ginny hand from his sleeve and clasping it in his own i just glad you re with me tonight once back in the common room harry and ginny parted to go and get ready harry was ready for the ball in no time only having to change into his dark green robe wash his face and spray a little aftershave he didnteven attempt to flatten his hair he knew he d only make it worse harry passed dean and seamus on his way down the stairs and when he got to the common room it was almost deserted a few boys littered the edge of the bright and festive room a couple of preteens trying their first butterbeer harry slouched into the largest most comfortable couch he could find in the most secluded corner he rested his eyes trying to get into a ball frame of mind if there ever was such a thing he wanted to be ready when ginny descended the girls staircase looking like a princess when she smiled at him waiting for his approval he couldntwait to see her harry was spinning in a dimly lit room the great hall his mind told him before he d made the decision there were hundreds of couples dancing around spinning and twirling one of those couples was him and ginny are you alright harry ginny asked her voice sounded distant almost inaudible but harry knew what she was going to say before she moved her lips harry knew where he was the christmas ball the time between his rest and now had somehow leaked away he had one hand holding ginny s and his other he could feel on ginny slender waist he didntbreak eye contact with her he didnthave too why dontyou sit down ginny suggested looking concerned she led him to one side of the hall and sat him on a chair you dontlook too well harry harry looked at his reflection in ginny eyes he didntlook to well and he felt even worse i going to go to madame pomfrey ginny said taking harry hand harry noticed how small and cold her hands were not like he remembered i ll be right back with something to help just sit there i ll be right back harry tried to call ginny back but his mouth had gone dry his head was aching this had happened before and he knew what would happen next he had to stop her he rose from his chair his mind suddenly clear the voices of the people around him became load and their figures sharp harry ran faster then he ever remembered running but as he reached the door he heard a piercing scream it made his ears burn he knew who it belonged too and he knew why the room turned black the silence rung in harry ears he lent onto the wall as the door creaked open someone was behind it and harry knew that someone was going to tell him she was dead harry bolted straight up almost flying out of his seat to find ron looming in front of him you alright mate ron asked waving his hand hopefully before harry face yeah harry sighed wiping the clammy sweat from his forehead it was just a dream good ron said only half listening now i going to the owlery to get that firewhisky fred and george have sent over i ll be right back but if hermione ready early which i doubt tell her where i am harry nodded mutely and ron wandered away in a world of his own the common room was much fuller then before harry thought though there was nobody around who he knew well so many happy faces lighthearted conversation pecks under the mistletoe that stuff what everywhere and in very strategic places the archway above the girls staircase hanging above the portrait hole above the drinks table harry wondered if given the chance he d kiss ginny under the mistletoe he thought back to the cho incident and cringed yet he somehow the idea still had it appeal maybe he said in a hushed voice to nobody in particular before sauntering up the boys staircase he washed the cold sweat of off his forehead and ran his wet fingers through his untamable hair it sat up in a gelled mess and harry ignored the marauders taunting as he went back to the common room once he d reached the bottom step of the stairs he heard someone call his voice harry hermione yelled almost frantically harry scanned the common room for hermione who was impossible to miss for a start as far as harry could she she was the only girl who was in the room she wore a powder pink dress robe with puffed sleeves and a long flowing skirt her hair was down and curly with half a dozen pink roses across the top of her head her eyes were accented by pale shades hermione you look beautiful harry said honestly that beside the point harry hermione stressed barely keeping her composure oh harry i cantgo to the ball with ron why harry asked because i in love with him ahhhhhhhh whats going to happen what is hermione talking about the madness i think it merits some reviews chapter 34 they kissed long enough to give ginny a chance to giggle before they pulled apart ron kept his arms twined round her waist sweetly will you go with me now he asked grinning cheekily oh ron hermione exclaimed pulling him into a tight hug and nearly sending them both flying harry and ginny laughed loudly and knocked the couple out of their reverie oh you two ron said blushing yet not moving i forgot we were here ginny asked with sheer delight hermione and harry passed a grin between them and harry gave her a look which quite clearly said that it was about time you know you two should go hermione said taking her head from ron chest the balls already started and me and ron should talk oh ron moaned cantwe talk tomorrow i hungry you re always hungry hermione stated fidgeting in his grasp no ron affirmed i always ron i always honest and i always in love with you that all hermione tilted her head to one side perhaps contemplating ron words and ron leaned forward and kissed her lightly again you know you cantjust do that every time you want something hermione insisted crossing her arms with an unconvincing smirk ron gave hermione his best puppy dog eyes and it was obvious hermione wasntgoing to win fine she sighed calmly and ron gave her one of his famous lopsided grins what am i going to do with you i could think of a few things he d like harry said in an undertone and ginny giggled you could come and dance with me ron said taking both her hands in his i d have never thought of that ginny sniggered tapping her dead mockingly are we keeping you ron said gruffly and the message was clear alright alright harry chuckled we re going come on gin harry held out his hand and ginny clasped it with her own before strolling perfectly into the great hall the decorations adorning the walls were astounding harry was sure hogwarts had never made an effort like this in his world mind you they d never had a christmas ball before there was no time for planning balls and clubs when you had to plan armies training protection spells and a way to defeat the dark lord hanging from the walls were great tapestries all colored gold red or green large christmas trees stood bearing bulbs of light and twinkles of sheen streamed everywhere mistletoe was occupying every wall and to harry surprise the marauders merry christmas poster which had been confiscated had somehow found it way to a prime spot of wall couples were dancing around the hall and a color didntseem to have been missed if harry hadntbeen so indulged in the parade around him he may have noticed that half the population of hogwarts was giving him the most evil looks for having such a beautiful date she was easily the bell of the ball but harry didntneed anyone to tell him that why dontwe find a table harry suggested blushing as he met ginny eyes he didntknow why he did it maybe he was just hot sure she smiled we can dance after dinner look there dean and erin come on ginny dragged harry towards a table at the far right hand corner and harry trailed along quite happily he didntmind if they were dancing or sitting he was already enjoying himself there was a bright bubble leaping in harry stomach and he had no intention of trying to make it go away it was as if now that ron and hermione were together there was hope for the rest of the world anything was possible heya prongs gin dean grinned shifting his arm from around erin shoulders hey harry replied pulling out ginny chair for her which made her giggle the pair sat down opposite dean and erin having fun ginny asked more erin then dean yes erin replied twirling one of her curls i actually am of course she is she here with me dean insisted confidently everyone knows that marauders make the best dates well i cantdisagree with that harry shrugged and both girls clicked their tongues disapprovingly well you d better watch yourselves or you might just find you re the best dateless dates erin smirked and ginny gave her a hi 5 ok ok dean said i guess we ll just have to prove that marauders make the best dates if you two arentconvinced be my guest erin said cheekily and dean began to lean in could i have a word with you dean harry asked putting his hand between their two faces dean mumbled something inaudible and allowed harry to drag him away you upset my sister once you re not doing it again harry stated icily alright mate dean sighed i ll try and keep my hands off but i cantguarantee she ll do the same she will and you will and everything will be just peachy harry said harshly before softening into a smile just leave her alone i ll try but i think that might be difficult dean insisted i am her date after all and that fine wormy harry smiled before counting off on his fingers as long as theres no flirting no contact no slow dancing no hugging and definitely no kissing i hope those rules dontapply to us too a voice said from behind harry and he turned round to face his date she had a mischievous glint in her eye and a naughty grin on her face nope harry smiled and ginny slipped herself under harry arm and wrapped hers around his waist that just the rules the older brother has to give and since none of your older brothers seem to be around i d say we can do what we like good ginny smiled deeply up at harry and he found himself thinking about what he d just said if you d all like to make your way to your tables the crisp old voice of dumbledore sounded we can start our magnificent feast gradually the patches of color faded away from the dance floor and found spaces at the tables around the outside harry dean and ginny took their places again before being interrupted is anyone sitting here a soft masculine voice asked the owner of the said voice was wearing silky black robes and an unsure expression sure draco harry smiled warmly and turned to draco date and you re brooke arentyou yes she grinned broadly harry imagined at one of the marauders knowing her name she seemed to be in a much better mood now that she d found her date and you re harry of course you played brilliantly in our last quidditch match thanks harry chimed he hadnthad a compliment in some time and it was nice to be appreciated you played well too ginny brooke said almost shyly you handle the ball brilliantly do you like quidditch ginny asked giving brooke a friendly smile yeah it great brooke brightened i tried out but i never made the team but you guys are really good and a close team so i didntexpect to well maybe you could pass by at practice some time do some flying dean suggested suddenly interested yeah we could do with a reserve harry added hi hermione said as her and ron approached she was dragging ron by the hand much in the same way that ginny had done with harry before hermione was bright red in the face and grinning from ear to ear ron on the other hand was wearing a dazed expression hey he smiled loftily so what did we miss hermione asked ordinarily like they d been late for class nothing much harry chuckled so where have you two been nowhere ron sighed leaning his arm on the table and his head in his hand staring absent mindedly at hermione we were just making our way inside slowly hermione lied brilliantly occupying herself with her knife and fork hmmm was ron reply and are you two ginny asked looking girly and excited we didntget that far we ll talk about it tomorrow i guess hermione said and ron shifted a curl of hair behind her ear oh do stop it ron you re acting like you ve only just noticed i alive no i knew before ron said warmly but i couldntdo this before ron cupped hermione face and kissed her tenderly again get a room dean exclaimed some of us are trying to eat harry suddenly noticed that food had filled the shiny silver plates and began to pile dinner in front of him hastily hungry ginny asked amusement playing on her freckles not really he mumbled for lack of a better answer he shook his head since when did he ever run out of things to say to ginny harry thought about the girl beside him throughout his meal barely speaking at all erin and dean caught ginny up in heated discussion about female quidditch players which harry was more then happy to watch ginny looked really cute when she was flustered her nose scrunched her skin flushed her eyes grew wide hermione and brooke shared a conversation to harry left about the importance of caring for unicorn and other endangered species brooke often asking for ron opinion while twirling her hair but ron didntseem interested ron and draco contented themselves with small talk all previous quarrels forgotten ginny slid her hand onto harry knee as she laughed at a joke someone had made this seemed to be shaping up into a pretty good date once dinner was over the table disappeared and all the chairs were charmed to one side time for dancing harry stated taking ginny delicate hand great brooke squeaked flattening out her purple sash and her and draco were off well here goes nothing ron sighed and hermione smiled dontyou like dancing hermione asked sarcastically it not that i dontlike it ron explained it just that mum made me take tones of lessons when i was little and now i can hardly stand it well i afraid you re going to have too hermione huffed putting one of ron hands on her waist i not making out with you all night harry and ginny chuckled before meeting each others eyes and going red young love erin mused at harry and ginny before turning to dean i cantbe bothered to dance he stated looking questioningly at erin well how about we dance for a bit just to take away any suspicion erin suggested then we can go and dungbomb snape office brilliant dean said sounding really chuffed you re the best date ever dean swept erin off her feet and left harry and ginny alone in a shifty silence did you take dancing lessons when you were younger harry asked staring out into the crowd yes ginny replied did you like them they were ok she nodded but i had to learn with ron and he always stood on my toes the pair smiled well i promise i wont stand on your toes harry assured her may i have this dance you certainly may ginny grinned impishly they danced for some time how long it was impossible to say it was lighthearted and innocent and harry couldnthelp but enjoy himself he almost felt giddy like a little school girl even ron was having fun i never thought i could like dancing this much ron called as hermione pulled herself closer to ron on a slower number harry and ginny had continued waltzing it was more fun that way they just joked and laughed not caring what anyone said or thought they swayed and sang and twirled and turned hours passed in a second and the load of the dance floor lessened dean and erin had disappeared long ago taking advantage of snape absence draco and brooke had taken a break and now supported drinks apparently hermione had kept up her side of the bargain and her and ron where nowhere to be seen they were probably occupying a cupboard somewhere harry mused it seemed lavender and seamus had done the same as they werentaround either what you thinking about ginny asked cutely one of her hands rested in harry s and the other arm curled round his shoulder and clasped it nothing harry smiled down at her he wasnttall but ginny was still a good few inches shorter then him just wondering where everyone is it doesnttake a genius to work it out ginny said raising an eyebrow i know harry replied it just weird not having them around i mean i was expecting to have ron breathing down my neck all night well i think you re free ginny said lightly i doubt they ll be back for a while good harry stated with the devil in him and sharply pulled her small figure closer with a smirk he could now feel her body next to him they eyeballed each other as they danced with defiant looks it was as if they were challenging each other to move away neither did maybe we should get a drink ginny suggested after some time her face was red and her voice choked sure harry glowed and led her back towards their table draco and brooke were still there and brooke was rambling animatedly about something but draco didntseem to be listening butterbeer harry asked picking up a bottle ok ginny nodded it not like we donthave enough up in our common room i know harry chuckled thinking back to the many crates he d seen piled by the fireplace i dontthink that dean and seamus realize you d have to drink about 50 gallons to get drunk on that stuff maybe they ll spike it with firewhisky ginny suggested now that cantbe nice harry replied wincing and sticking his tongue out i not too sure they ll care ginny smiled and harry suddenly realized in what close proximity they were to each other he dropped his gaze in defense he looked at their hands which were clasped and laced their fingers it felt nice to hold hands with ginny not like it had been with cho with cho it had had to mean something mind you harry reminded himself that was a long time ago maybe he was over that he raised his eye line a little and followed the glitter on ginny dress before reaching her creamy white neck then her face her eyes were wide and questioning her lips parted a little each tiny freckle glittered in the light harry carried on his gaze upwards looking at the halo of a tiara she wore and her shiny golden hair then out the corner of his eye something caught his attention mistletoe harry declared looking unsurely at the frosty snippet ginny looked up too oh she said appearing nervous for the first time that evening i didntnotice when ginny lowered her gaze again she found harry staring thoughtfully into her deep brown eyes he began to lean in ever so slowly he felt ginny hands tense in his so he ran his thumbs over the back of them reassuringly he tipped his head to the right as he got near enough to feel her breath and she soundlessly closed her eyes harry the accusing voice of an older brother sounded and harry pulled sharply away hey ron he said automatically before spotting his friend a few feet away you back what does it look like ron barked with his hands on his hips come on ron hermione ushered in ron ear lets dance again hermione whisked ron away but the moment was lost do you want to dance harry asked ginny felling strangely shaken erm no ginny stuttered i think i ll just have a drink ginny opened her butterbeer bottle with her teeth in a most unladylike manor and took a careful swig hi brooke said as she swooped in next to ginny and picked up a bottle where draco harry asked searching the dance floor i afraid i lost him to a better dancer brooke chuckled and pointed to draco swing dancing in the middle of the hall with no other than luna lovegood now there something you dontsee every day harry mused before turning to ginny wouldntby any chance have a camera would you i wish ginny said her focus fixed harry laughed as draco lifted luna in her deep red dress and swung her round before looking back to ginny her gaze faltered for a second and harry realized that she wasntwatching the dancing her eyes were lingering on the open door which revealed to all the dark night and cold grounds of hogwarts harry ginny said with a gasp her eyes never moving from their spot could you excuse me for a moment before waiting for an answer ginny paced her way across the hall and through the crowd harry watched her in silence before she was out of sight and the activity in the center began to thicken he twisted his hands nervously feeling suddenly alone before his senses kicked in he needed to follow her what if there was something dangerous out there but if she d spotted something surely she would have told him giving in to his curiosity he followed ginny example and made his way to the door once outside in the cold sharp wind he felt more like his old self then ever ginny harry called as he spotted her shivering form across the grass she turned her head and harry stormed over her way why are you out here is something wrong no she replied folding her arms and looking distant i just though i saw something what harry asked his brows furrowing now dontlaugh at me i know i must be seeing things ginny began her eyes trailing through the midnight draft but i sure that i just saw a hooded figure walk past here what harry sharpened why didntyou i thought it was riddle she said normally i recognized the way he walked and i thought he was leaving but it couldnthave been him he didnthave his cases do you think it was a death eater harry asked his form poised in panic here ginny questioned unconvinced yes harry stressed where did the hooded figure go into the forest ginny replied and harry blood ran cold he d been in the forest days ago maybe weeks ago and he d met a hooded figure it had slipped his mind with all of the teenage problems he d been provided with now it was as clear as ever ginny harry ordered we need to go inside he led her almost solemnly back to the hall his enjoyment of the evening gradually draining away ginny harry stated holding her shoulders when they were back inside i saw a hooded figure in the forbidden forest the other day he d seen the hooded figure when he d been in his animagus form harry turned his head and shifted his gaze to the forest almost itching to change back into a stag and hunt down the intruder it seemed ginny had something on her mind to as he spotted her picking at the stitching on her dress that doesnthave to mean anything ginny said unconvincingly the last time there was a hooded figure in the forest it was voldemort harry stated almost shaking with adrenalin we cantrisk this well what do you suggest we do ginny asked looking suddenly young and innocent we tell dumbledore harry said leaning towards the teachers table the old man eyes were glittering at him but if we tell dumbledore now ginny began we ll have to tell him the whole story then the chances are that he ll send us all home maybe even before you get to meet your parents harry stood paralyzed for a moment well that a risk i just going to have to take harry insisted i wont let you ginny said looking tearful you ve always wanted to meet them more then anything i not letting you throw this all away because of something i think i saw i always seeing things that arentthere since the war happened i always on guard suspecting everything and my imagination goes into overload but i saw it too harry murmured please ginny begged a tear escaping her eye just let it go we re here and we re safe there no dark lord and no worries just you and me harry looked sadly at ginny and her anxious eyes and suddenly felt guilty the crystal drops swimming down her face were genuine and cold her once optimistic bright orbs had deepened to dark spheres he was reminded directly of how ginny was in his world troubled yet content content in his wake he lifted his hands and wiped the tears silently from her face there was no need for words he left his hand cupping her left cheek and felt her smooth skin ripple beneath his touch her expression was priceless yet indescribable it just reflected the many years he d known her somewhere deep in her gaze he could even see the little girl in the chamber of secrets just dieing to get out she wanted a chance to prosper and not be replaced by maturity and solitude she wanted a chance to love harry saw his reflection in ginny eyes his watch was one of adoration and admiration and a familiar look he d seen her give him so many times he understood harry lent in with a spontaneous swoop and kissed her straight on the lips as simple as that it lasted only a second before he pulled away do you want to dance harry asked his voice deep this must be one of the last dances yeah she glowed and shyly let him lead her into the thicket they danced for a few minutes in silence their eyes barely meeting harry could feet his heart pounding faster then ever in his chest his lips felt like they were on fire ginny moved angelically her eyes lulling in content and her voice humming a soft warbling tune harry was entranced the pleasant music suddenly melted into a uniform waltz and ginny took the lead with a leap they surrounding pairs twirled and span and harry wasnttoo sure if he was moving or if they were it all made him so dizzy are you alright harry ginny asked as she gave his hand a squeeze he was holding her hand of course he was why dontyou sit down ginny suggested and she took harry effortlessly to the nearest table harry felt his knees go weak as he slumped into a chair you dontlook too well harry his head was pounding harry assumed that someone had spiked his butterbeer probably dean before ginny said 7 chilling words i going to go to madame pomfrey harry turned sharply to her cinnamon eyes what i ll be right back with something to help just sit there ginny said with concern i ll be right back harry knew she wouldn t no he shouted as she took her first step the memory came back dontgo but you look sick ginny said seeming hurt i ll just be a minute but you wont harry begged his vision fogging dontgo ginny you have to trust me i had a what ginny bleated harry head suddenly felt to big for his body and his stomach clamped every fiber of his body was telling him to keep her here yet his physical form was weakening his grasp on her hand unwinding harry ginny shivered are you ok talk to me harry stay he mumbled tightening his grip on her with all his might they stayed there for a moment harry trying to pull himself together before a great force pinched harry mind a wincing scream filled the bright and bold room of the great hall it was blood curdling and made the hairs on the back of harry back stand on end yet the voice wasntginny this time harry flicked his eyes open in an instant his reactions as perfect as before he stared through the dim hushed silence of the room until the door creaked open and a figure heaved unwelcomingly into the hall a n finally some action in the story sorry about the extra paragraph at the end of the last chapter bet you didnteven notice i put it there when i was writing to remind myself of what had happened i ve deleted it now but sorry if it caused any confusion harry didntfaint at the end of the last chapter i left it where the doors of the great hall opened and an unwelcome figure stood there i ve planned out the rest of this story if you re interested and it going to have exactly 50 chapters i hope you guys keep reading to the end and that we hit 1000 reviews i ve got a suprise planned for the 1000 reviewer thanks for all the reviews so far keep reading always angel chapter 35 a time to celebrate draco malfoy stood in the only passage of light a young maiden clutched in his shaking arms he shuddered distraughtly and fell to his knees under her weight the girl had long silver hair and noble features yet her dainty corpse looked as stiff as a board although the whole assembly was staring panicked at the scene nobody made an attempt to move except harry he ran forward without hesitation and crashed by the child side she s she dead draco stuttered his world braking who is this harry asked where did you find her she my sister draco sobbed she screamed i didntknow what to do she was outside the girls bathroom crying harry studied her body hoping to come to a different conclusion her limbs were stiff and cold to touch her midnight blue eyes were glued open her expression fixed she not dead harry knelled she just been petrified harry followed the victims gaze down to her shiny purple gray dress and fingered the crisp reflecting fabric he loomed over her skirt and was repaid with his own reflection she saw its reflection in her gown ginny bleated calmly from harry right that dress saved her life could all students please report back to their common rooms immediately dumbledore grave voice ordered you are to stay there until further notice prefects take your houses now students hurried past the small cluster and out of the doors fragile girls hung onto strong boys arms younger students cradled each other in groups the tension was like none harry had ever felt in this world it reminded him of home harry stood strongly and ran from the comfort of enclosure he raged across the entrance hall and charged in the opposite direction of all the other students yet no one questioned his intentions he wouldnthave heard them if they had alarm bells were sounding in his head once out of sight he transformed into a stag hoping for his animal senses to guide him he ran blindly round the upper floors blood surging through his body pulsing at every point his instinct was to slay his mind could not see how harry transformed back breathless and hasty he needed to get inside the head of the basilisk he wiped the beads of sweat from his forehead and brushed his scar unintentionally a spark ran through him testing his will power he cursed out load yet the words he raged didntenlighten his senses he spoke the words of the snake come out harry hissed menacingly come out to play i know you re here somewhere come out you great ugly beast do you want to live past tonight said a severe worried hiss which harry knew didntbelong to the basilisk harry turned round and was faced with a shady angel ginny he spoke in his own tongue the stress draining out of his features you can speak to snakes you surely dontthink i spent a year giving my soul to voldemort and didnttake anything back in return ginny almost snarled i thought you lost your whole connection with him in the chamber harry stated blankly i did ginny said calmly but neither of us will ever forget what we learnt come out my precious we have work to do harry watched ginny lips pronounce death so fluently harry had always considered his talent a curse yet ginny turned it into an art form come out my friend you know me ginny whispered with her eyes lightly closed i an old friend you may have forgotten my tone but i here you will remember a great unsettling hiss cascaded down the corridor in reply for harry a fight for his live with no plan or initiative was nothing out of the ordinary yet the prospect of a great snake appearing with ginny around was unbearable go harry shouted i can do this alone i did it once i can do it again dontbe stupid harry ginny stated i not leaving you go find a teacher what help will that do i not risking your life harry said extracting his wand from his pocket if you see it you ll die i have glasses i ll only get petrified then it ll eat you ginny stressed what a great plan look please just go harry begged taking one of her hands if anything happened to you another great atonal hiss sounded and ginny lifted her chin i over here my precious she hissed then turned to harry if you die here you know our world will never be fixed if i die it doesntmake any difference no harry challenged her if you die here our world will never be fixed how can i fix our world if mines already broken harry ginny persisted her glare unbelieving anyway who said anything about dieing harry sighed his eyes bright i dontintend to just please go and get dumbledore ginny rushed around the corner unhappily running an errand to safety harry poised himself ready for the battle his knuckles were white from holding his wand so tight and his eyes were cast open just a fraction the basilisk didntcome merlin where is it harry tempered before resulting back to snake basilisk come out harry ginny screamed possibly only a corridor away harry blood ran cold i coming harry called his legs running faster then his mind until he reached a shadow of a monster and dame in its pathway ginny keep your eyes closed no reply it was so silent harry could hear his heart beating in his chest what was she doing he couldntsee round the corner harry she gasped again ever so quietly sliding was evident harry assumed the beast was moving perhaps nearer to the little redhead the swish of a tail sounded and the ripping of cloth tore at harry heat strings then a thud he flung his head round the corner of the passage to find the basilisks tail slithering into a dark empty classroom ginny was gone harry flew into the room behind the monster to find ginny standing flat against the wall her hand was in her pocket and her eyes tight closed as she muttered something secret under her breath harry wished he had her whole attention it might have been helpful nevertheless he swiped his wand high into the air and stunned the beast with all his might it flinched and began to turn but harry was too fast he charmed its eyelids shut the basilisk let out a strangled cry and ginny eyes flew open she like harry had known what it had called blind the great snake thumped its tail in harry direction causing him to fly off his feet ginny ran to harry aid are you ok she asked lending him a hand fine he replied jumping back up again in truth he wasn t but he d have time to reflect on that later before the monster could issue a second swipe a gift levitated its way to ginny and she handed it to harry the sorting hat ginny stated shoving it roughly into harry hands i summoned it you used it before right harry chimed and the basilisks head looked straight at the pair harry slid the golden sword of godric gryffindor out of the hat as the snake drew nearer each breath harry or ginny took only gave the beast a better estimation of their whereabouts they held the air in their throats and closed their mouths for a moment no sudden movements came from either party before harry leapt forward his weapon at arms length and stabbed the snake right through the neck the brute swayed before collapsing with a grand thud harry drew his knife out of the animal and allowed it to hang bleeding from his limp arm ginny tiptoed to harry side dragging her torn dress as best she could both stared at the carcass before them as their wounds bruised and bled and a fraction of time dripped by my potter miss weasley the firm voice of mcgonagal roared harry and ginny turned around slowly and tamely until they faced a party of mcgonagal snape lupin sirius and of course dumbledore whatever happened she questioned her face in anger and disbelief what was that great bang you ought to be in your common rooms the monster that petrified draco sister was a basilisk harry explained his voice toneless we found it when we went to find ron and hermione they d been gone a while and professor dumbledore told prefects to watch their houses so that gave you permission to wander through the castle unattended sirius shouted seeming to miss the point about the snake you have no idea how worried we were it was a most foolish thing to do lupin added fatherly we may have to consider expulsion for both of you mcgonagal ranted i should assume mr potter wanted a chance to get in the limelight snape drawled and it seems he may have got it if you hadntnoticed theres a giant dead snake behind them and potter seems to have slayed it all attention was suddenly turned to the basilisk and the room was filled with shock mr potter mcgonagal asked her eyes threading from the monster to the sword how on earth it is time you two headed back to your common room dumbledore said unassumingly you can tell me the story on the way harry and ginny turned unsurely to each other before following the old man outside once they had reached the portrait of the fat lady dumbledore had heard an almost true version of the nights events they d cut out the part where they spoke to the basilisk added in the part where they read about the snake and sword in a book and ginny told the part where the basilisk had picked her up by her robes and thrown her into the classroom harry wasntready to tell the real story of how he knew he was too tired to deal with the consequences as was ginny inside the common room students huddled and grouped each clammy face paler then the next the party seemed to have been forgotten the butterbeer hadnteven been touched the only thing that brought comfort to the relations was dumbledore entering the common room with the smallest of smiles harry and ginny trailing behind him i have an announcement dumbledore cheered in light of mr potter and miss weasley great triumph they will both get special awards from the school and 100 points each to your house the feedback from the company was murmured gossip nobody had any idea what was being commended harry looked around the room wearily to ron who was hugging hermione tightly he gave harry a puzzled look and harry shook his head but of course allow me to explain dumbledore smiled mr potter and miss weasley came across the reason for isabel malfoy predicament isabel was petrified by a basilisk arentthey extinct misty a younger student asked that what we thought but it turns out that there was just one left dumbledore said and mr potter slayed it he is quite the hero we all need to be thankful for what these two students achieved tonight and i suggest you get this party going you have a true reason to celebrate now alright seamus hoorayed punching a fist in the air what about isabel brooke asked from her secluded spot by the entrance is she going to be ok of course dumbledore smiled warmly it just so happens that we can get just enough potion sent over from france to heal isabel she might even be well by christmas now start the celebrations i daresay you ve been searching for a reason for a party for months come miss capulet i will take you to mr and miss malfoy in the hospital wing brooke followed dumbledore solemnly out of the common room and as soon as they were out of earshot a bright commotion filled the room how did you do it harry what happened how big was the basilisk did it bite you were you scared how did you kill it i kicked it to its death harry half heartedly joked all those karate lessons paid off now if you ll excuse me harry stalked away from the group and found ginny surrounded by a similar ensemble can i have a word ginny harry asked over the unrelenting girls lavender gave him a scowl as ginny flounced away the torn net of her dress trailing behind her thought you might want some space harry stated resting his hands in his pockets with his eyes watching the ground well you thought right ginny sighed taking leave at the nearest seat we re telling dumbledore straight after christmas right harry nodded something has to be done about this ginny stressed before adding an after thought the funny thing is that the basilisk didnteven worry me for over a year now i ve been waiting for a gang of armed death eaters to jump out at me the basilisk almost seemed petty by comparison i know harry groaned we need to go home the pair watched the common room filled with glitter and lights music and laughter and somehow felt dispensed from the group seamus had lavender grinning under one arm and a bottle in his other hand dean and erin were downing butterbeers by the second daisy laughing at their antics ron and hermione had found a not so secluded corner and were enjoying each others company colin and dennis madly took pictures and sky mitzi and the rest of the gang along with the 6th year boys were singing christmas carols quite merrily out of tune harry snaked his hand to ginny and entwined their fingers his gaze never faltering from the fireplace her fingers were cold and reflected the bitter dread he felt at the pit of his stomach harry sighed he wasnttoo sure where they stood right now but he knew they had an impossible amount in common they both recognized they had something more then friendship they could both talk to snakes and neither of them felt tonight was a time to celebrate a n first chapter i ve loaded since my 16th birthday yay thank you for all your reviews and sorry for the wait i had 16th birthday things to do i did read all your reviews though and somebody yet again assumed im american i n not i live in england i do have american spellcheck though which is probably where you guys have got it from so here we go another chapter it the day harry goes home for christmas not alot of drama i afraid i saving that for next chapter keep reading always angel chapter 36 rain on my parade harry watched the coal in the fireplace sizzle it was early morning obviously too early for the house elves to have done their rounds and harry was sitting alone in the dreary common room he spiked up his wand and shot a fireball of a charm at the grate which relit the blackened embers and awoke the whole room empty butterbeer bottles littered the floor and half eaten packets of jelly beans and chocolate frogs sat at every table and chair the banners and streamers still flashed red and gold but the glowing phantom adaptor which hermione had made to link to the speakers was gradually fading harry listened as soft tired footsteps trod their way down the girls staircase and a sleepy figure appeared clad in snuggly yellow pajamas oh morning harry erin said when she noticed his presence i thought it was too early for the house elves to have been yet they arentdue for about an hour erin took a seat next to harry right beside the hot licking flames i lit the fire it was getting cold harry mumbled putting his wand away why are you up so early anyway erin asked raising a familiar eyebrow no idea i wish i wasn t harry said with a smile he couldntstay in a bad mood with erin around she was so bright and filled with energy and fun leaving today erin stated i hope you ve packed yeah whatever harry said rolling his eyes mum and dad are going to be well chuffed when you tell them how you slaughtered that snake erin grinned i cantwait to see their faces you re bound to get that new broomstick now it not a big deal harry shrugged turning away from the conversation it not like it the first time i ve killed a basilisk i did it in my world too second year you re kidding erin exclaimed jumping in her seat how oh tell me it a long story harry said tonelessly folding his arms i ll tell you on the train erin took this as the end of the conversation and sort herself a book from the table she flicked boredly through the pages and harry watched as last nights curls fell hopelessly out of her hair did you have fun at the ball he asked after a while yeah erin answered still reading her book did dean keep his hands to himself harry pursued yeah erin replied then grinned did you keep your hands to yourself harry shook his head dismissively ginny he d kissed her he d kissed her outside he d tried to inside but ron had caught him what was he doing since when had the thought ever crossed his mind it hadn t ron was going to kill him i going to go and get dressed she said then trampled lazily back up the girls staircase erin didntimmerge again for perhaps half an hour harry sat going over scenes in his head kissing ginny dancing the door opening draco crying isabel lying so stiff and the basilisk the basilisk lightened a new beginning for this world the beginning of the end ginny was the least of his problems he needed to save this world and his own erin sat herself down in her previous seat when she re entered her hair was straight and wet and she wore daytime clothes with her favorite boots harry hadntmoved the whole time he merely watched the clock above the fireplace wishing it would roll back 24 hours you still sitting here erin grinned no i sitting over there harry said sarcastically as another early riser descended the girls staircase good morning all hermione smiled as she hopped down the last few steps did we all sleep well no and no erin replied chancing a sideways glance at a very disgruntled harry did you yes kind of hermione replied hovering beside the sofa is ron up yet no erin laughed you re a bit hopeful arentyou i suppose hermione said shyly knotting her hands together i just we need to talk about last night i guessing erin smiled teasingly i thought for a moment the hermione and ron i know were back what happened with you two i told him i loved him and he kissed me hermione grinned blushing brightly is he a good kisser erin asked on the edge of her seat mmmm hermione sighed excuse me harry interrupted boy present i dontwant to hear about ron kissing anyone then close your ears erin said so is he romantic with you i ve heard that about my ron but this is your ron he sweet hermione said simply i like him a lot i just have no idea what he going to say today well you re his girlfriend now arentyou erin assumed not exactly good morning chorused ginny and daisy as they entered the common room run for cover ginny harry joked in a grumble they re talking about ron kissing skills gross ginny gagged as took a shifty seat next to harry why are you two up so early erin questioned sounding slightly put out thought we d get up and do some packing daisy replied i haventeven started dreadful harry sighed thinking humorously of his half empty trunk and i suppose you ve finished ginny asked raising an eyebrow yeah harry mumbled dusty erin exclaimed making everyone jump and an old gray house elf came shuffling out of the shadows dusty doesntusually have to hide in the shadows this time in the morning miss erin the house elf rambled dusty usually finds nobody is up it alright dusty erin giggled go about your work we wont disturb you but miss erin dusty stammered house elves arentsupposed to be seen we wont tell daisy grinned and dusty scampered away returning only a moment later with twenty or so other helpers lacey will have this tidied in no time another elf squeaked and they went about their work i will miss the house elves over christmas erin sighed they re great company lacey taught me to knit the other day pretty clever harry laughed under his breath as he pictured erin sitting down with a house elf knitting a bobbley green jumper wow a voice said from across the room i didntexpect all you lot to be up it was dean with seamus slumping down the last few stairs in warm winter sweaters could say the same for you daisy smiled and the boys grumbled in return you re lucky i didntcome down in my boxers seamus said that what i usually do when it this early made a second year jump out of her skin once taught her for leaving her homework till last minute erin and daisy shook their heads in dismay but the others didnteven make a sound what up with your guys this morning seamus raved why are you all so quiet because we want to be harry confirmed bowing his head hermione seamus questioned i have my reasons she answered primly swaying her weight from foot to foot who rained on her parade dean asked as an aside as him and seamus took the remaining seats around the fire any hangovers from the endless butterbeer daisy asked to amuse herself oh definitely seamus faked lolling his head to one side endless headaches can hardly move dean added and the girls all grinned good morning everyone came a friendly voice and the group turned to find ron at the bottom of the staircase he looked exactly how he usually looked messy haired wearing jeans a cannons t shit and a smile hermione paled morning ron erin cheered characteristically right mate hey padfoot what are you lot doing ron asked normally putting his hands into his pockets and padding towards his friends not a lot harry replied nobody seems able to go past these chairs they ve all come downstairs and stopped here there must be some sort of a curse or force field here of something why dontwe all head down for breakfast ron suggested conversationally i starving you would be daisy said rolling her eyes come on ron exclaimed last breakfast all together before christmas sounds like a great idea erin smiled i say full steam ahead the troop slowly stood up from their chairs shuffling and mumbling ron let them begin to saunter away but stopped hermione as she passed him by not even a good morning he asked with a lopsided grin sorry hermione said slightly her hands twitching at her sides that ok ron smiled before grabbing her waist kissing her passionately pulling away and then adding you ll just have to make it up to me later hermione face was a picture as ron took her hand and led her away as if nothing had happened harry chuckled to himself having seen the whole thing ron really was oblivious to the world breakfast was non descript just the gang hanging out eating and laughing harry didntcare much for their banter nor understood how his best friends could be so cheerful surely ron and hermione had realized what the release of the basilisk had meant and ginny she was chatting so normally were worries not floating through her mind too harry watched the emptiness of the great hall a few hufflepuffs littered their table and susan bones sat with a quidditch player at hers the slytherin table was in mourning not a single student sat there harry thought it was sad there was always at least one occupant at that table but today the early rising boy could surly be found in the hospital wing watching his frozen sister sleep immobiley i going for a walk harry announced and left without a reply he wandered towards the hospital wing wanting to check up on the monsters damage it was amazing that the basilisk had run so freely and somehow nobody had been killed harry couldnthelp but think about how lucky they d been harry took a few flights of stairs and wondered across a few hallways very much in a world of his own the hospital wing was his destination yet his thoughts deemed too consuming and before he knew it he was getting lost in the depths of the castle a secret passage the map showed harry led him out of trouble and he was thankful for the marauders help for now he found himself down a familiar corridor too familiar harry trod quickly and roughly on the stone level before quitting to face the portal to a room he was sure he d find empty riddle office harry curiosity got the better of him and he creaked open the wooden entrance to the tomb he dustily sank his foot into the dread taking a soundless step inside before a clear voice made him jump good morning harry harry flung the door open and found none other than albus dumbledore behind riddles desk good morning harry hesitated unsurely it seems our history of magic teacher has found himself a new situation dumbledore mused reading a curling piece of parchment and at a most unfortunate time i was hoping to take a holiday in paris this christmas but now it seems i shall have to spend my time replacing him harry took a few uneasy steps inside and dumbledore finished his reading he gone harry stated noticing that riddle thick travel cloak had disappeared and he set the basilisk free before he went now harry dumbledore began theres certainly no need to jump to conclusions but it true isntit harry questioned his temper flaring i suppose we ought to have seen it coming dumbledore sighed tiredly he d been speaking of a new disposition for quite some time but it was him harry continued searching for comfort you know it was i afraid i don t harry dumbledore said honestly and harry felt lost it certainly an odd coincidence that both incidents took place on the same evening but we have no proof and i can think of no reason why professor riddle would put the students in such danger i afraid it makes no sense harry backed cautiously away every fiber of him rejecting dumbldore words his old smile and his glittering eyes his half moon spectacles how couldnthe know dumbledore knew everything is something the matter mr potter he asked almost knowingly through his glasses is there something you d like to tell me no harry stunted what good would it do telling a man who knew nothing how could it help just answer me one question have you ever heard a prophecy i can honestly say that i have dumbledore answered harry froze for a moment a cold chill rising in him well think about it harry said before exiting the room think about it harry wandered back to the common room which was much busier then before students were streaming the edges of the place and only the marauder and other popular scholars gathered around in the middle prongs my friend dean shouted across the room him ron and seamus were sitting on a table surrounded by others erin was perched by ron side daisy nearby and the rest of the girls were to their left boys to their right hey err everyone harry said falsely as he pushed his way to the center important news mate seamus insisted shoving over to make room for harry to sit pushing erin off in the process we ve decided to cancel the end of year prank why harry asked all this bad stuff happening dean explained looking shiftily around that giant snake and riddle done a runner too if you hadntheard must ve shit a brick when he heard about that malfoy girl left in a hurry some people reckon he left before that snake thing though seamus explained one girl thinks she saw him run away in a hooded cloak he was limping and everything maybe the snake got him which girl harry asked curiously one over there ron said pointing to a girl with long strawberry blonde hair she an edgecomb marietta edgecomb cousin i think how d you know her dean asked never mind harry stated before calling out lavender can you get that edgecomb girl for me lavender smiled and with a flick of blonde hair disappeared to get the requested girl do you think it really could ve been riddle ron asked harry he couldntjust leave like that i ve been to his office he gone harry stated i just want to check where harry you wanted me a pretty girl said she twiddled her long straight hair and had her friend on her arm a girl misty whom harry recognized they were both perhaps fourth years what your name harry asked trying his best to act cool indiana edgecomb she said proudly straightening her fringe i heard you saw riddle go harry said what did you see oh not a lot indiana gossiped i was busy with my date all i saw was him rush away in that dreadful traveling cloak he d didnthave his bags or anything so i sure he ll be back where did he go harry questioned perching on the edge of his seat towards the forest i think indiana said vaguely in that general direction he was shuffling around the outskirts there a pathway there maybe he was looking for it thanks harry smiled as best he could glad to be of service misty giggled before dragging her friend away into the gathering harry turned to ron about to tell him what ginny had seen before he noticed that ron was already occupied so maybe you could spend an extra few days at mine this christmas ron was sweet talking he was still sitting on the table with his legs open and hermione was standing in the gap they both had their arms around each other and seemed to be in their own little bubble ron hermione harry exclaimed swiping his hand between their faces did you just hear that sorry harry hermione asked her eyes glazed over never mind harry huffed before storming away to find ginny she was standing with a group of bright giggly girls lavender parvati mitzi skye and brooke among others her hair was up in a messy working bun and she looked most unamused ginny harry breathed can i have a work several girls huffed as ginny escaped the gossip what up harry ginny asked in a friendly way how was it that all weasleys acted like nothing had changed i ve been talking to indiana edgecombe harry explained feeling unsettled by ginny ease she said she saw riddle too so i heard ginny smiled unfortunately and harry felt his cheeks redden oh sorry to disturb you then harry mumbled scratching the back on his head no problem ginny chuckled i needed to escape anyway i ve not even started packing yet well if you want i could help you pack harry suggested for no apparent reason i ve got nothing else to do sure ginny grinned widely that d be great thanks well let go harry smiled uneasily and the pair trooped off to do ginny careful neat packing only appearing when they d finished folding everything perfectly leaving harry just enough time to throw his own things in his trunk before they left the marauders boarded the train loudly choosing themselves the biggest and best compartment seamus dean and erin sat opposite harry daisy and ginny ron and hermione disappeared to do prefect duties i cantwait to get home daisy beamed mum and dad are taking me and neville out ice skating then we re going to see a west end show lucky you dean replied when i get home i doing absolutely nothing i going to lock myself in my bedroom and ignore my brothers and sisters all christmas christmas is a time for family dean erin warned which is why harry and i are going to go out and do our annual christmas break flying arentwe harry harry oh oh yeah harry mumbled taking his gaze away from the window are you alright harry ginny asked childishly just the way she would at home i fine harry lied do you want to talk ginny asked timidly we could go for a walk harry nodded his head and they both began to leave oi where are you two going dean called as they opened the compartment door we re going to make out in a spare compartment ginny said sarcastically ok have fun seamus joked if you see ron and hermione snogging remind them to breathe the duo stepped outside and ginny slid close the icy door what the matter harry she asked looking rather nervous and pale is it about ginny didntfinish her sentence she was too busy watching harry shiny eyes as they littered the ground i just thinking about going home harry said unable to find the right words that all ginny distanced herself a little looking rather confused and put out harry wanted to tell her how he was feeling he really did but he didntwant to worry her dumbledore was harry security blanket and now dumbledore was useless harry felt all his hope run down the gutter dumbledore wasnteven suspicious of riddle even after the basilisks release and hearing the prophecy the prophecy harry should have known if trelawny was hired then of course the prophecy had been made in this world riddle wasntevil before but it was only a matter of time harry ginny whispered and he turned his attention to her if there something you want to say no harry stated leaning against the wall i just need some space fine ginny huffed looking almost hurt then i going back inside ginny abandoned harry something which he hadntbeen expecting harry felt every little bit of comfort she gave his disappear and let himself into a cold empty compartment somewhere down the other end of the train harry sat quite alone fiddling with the pattern of his jumper he could see the snow falling again out of the window and wondered how many more times it would care to call this winter harry a little voice questioned and harry turned his head what are you doing here all by yourself i wanted some space erin harry humped erin wandered purposefully inside in silence and took a seat opposite harry ginny looked pretty upset when she came back inside erin toyed snuggling her knees up to her chest what did you say to her i didntsay anything harry said thoughtfully i guess maybe that why erin said and was met with no response are you thinking about ginny no harry replied bluntly i can honestly say ginny is the last thing on my mind at the moment i guess that fair erin said simply i d be thinking about mum and dad too if i was in your position harry mind suddenly paused he d been so wrapped up in the future that he d somehow forgotten about the present this train ride today didntlead to a holiday of ignorant relatives and cleaning he was really going home i ll leave you alone erin smiled kissing her brother on the head then walking away just remember not to eat too many sweets dinner will be ready when we get home home erin left the room in silence and harry turned away from the window where did he live where would he have grown up if he d led the life he should have led would it be a big house would there be a big garden where they could play quidditch a tree house they stayed in as kids could this be the chance for harry to live a family life he d always dreamed of eating a sunday roast dinner surrounded by his relatives maybe he d even get to meet his grandparents after his mum and dad of course the famous lily and james potter he wondered how he d recognize them when the train stopped if he d spot them in a crowd his mother wearing the same smile she wore on her wedding day his father holding her hand the train jolted in an instant hours melting into only snippets of thoughts and this moment living up to years of dreams harry scampered franticly out of his compartment and stole a look in the busy hallway window hundreds of people jumbled outside the train fidgeting in circles and clumps winter jackets lead to bright ruddy faces grandparents aunts and uncles younger siblings all smiling harry turned to run and retrieve his trunk but found that someone had already done it erin she lugged it to his side and signaled in the direction of the frenzied crowd this was it harry chugged out of the train and trailed his trunk across the wet stone he searched couple after couple face after face with no avail until a giggle caught his attention a young couple stood on the outskirts of the platform huddled under an umbrella the man wore a business like muggle composition while the woman was clad in a fashionable green winter jacket she giggled as her husband wiped her snowy red hair away from her face before something caught her eye harry she called out with glee he smiled hi

almost too surreal for harry everything began to move in slow motion his mother embracing him tightly and giving him a kiss on the head his father holding him in a fatherly hug harry simply stood immobiley his mouth wide open in disbelief and an invisible force playing on his heart strings it took a moment for his senses to keep up and all he managed to say feebly was i missed you lily looked sadly at harry with his eyes and tipped her head adoringly to one side come here she said angelically and pulled her only son into a hug once more harry clung onto his mother like a child aching for reassurance and love he snuggled up to her small frame and allowed her to stroke the back of his head comfortingly he clasped his eyes tightly down not allowing a single tear to escape before he pulled away unwillingly are you alright lily asked and harry broke i fine he croaked his eyes wet and alert just glad i going home well we re glad to have you home james said grandly a twinkle of mischief in his eyes it makes a nice change harry faced the man he d been told of so often and it was like looking in a mirror his father was boyish and impish his mop of raven hair was identical to harry s and he had a definite playful streak harry could tell this just by looking at the expression on his face it was the one erin wore constantly mum a bright red head cheered and harry smiled at her timing dad erin flung her trunk into the floor and hugged each parent in turn have a good journey lily asked erin i hope there were no problems with the snow snow harry took a wide look around at the station which was covered with winter flakes it really was perfect no everything was fine erin chimed glee etching into her features james cupped erin rosy face into his weathered hands and smiled i glad you re in a good mood princess he cooed then turned to harry maybe in too much of a good mood what are you implying erin teased her father your brother told me all about your little boyfriend dean james toyed and his wife rolled her eyes and i ve also heard about yourself and miss weasley at the ball son has she finally given in donttease the kids lily said playfully slapping james on the shoulder i ll tell you all about it later dad harry grinned the next few hours were quite a blur to harry the family flued home to the potter mansion lily and james went to check on dinner and erin tugged harry up to his bedroom where he exhaustedly fell asleep it was morning when harry awoke and the sun was smiling through a large shiny window dressed with rich red curtains he rolled slumberly out of bed with a smile on his face and slipped on what he assumed to be his silk dressing gown and slippers before admiring his bedroom properly the walls were predictably red and the decorations gold posters and pictures were everywhere the marauders first year to the current day him and erin through the ages a large family portrait also took up a large amount of space harry was glad to see yet not as much as ginny pictures of ginny were left right and center some from before ginny could have even been at hogwarts had he loved her for that long harry took a steady step towards his collection and peeled a muggle polaroid photo off the wall ginny was sitting angelically on a swing which had been cleverly fixed to a tree vines holding beautiful flowers grew down the ropes and ginny smiled in her innocent white dungarees and shiny golden hair which barley reached her shoulders harry turned the picture over to read the caption ginevra looking like an angel summer before the year i make her mine harry chuckled this was the little girl he d fallen in love with ginny barely 11 years old now she was a lot different yet in some ways just the same harry put the photo in his pocket and surveyed the trinkets and compilations that he kept a shelf of books and quidditch magazines a box of chocolate frogs and a couple of magical gadgets on his bedside cabinet beside a plate of what looked like last nights dinner everything else was packed away well he had always liked to keep things simple harry skipped merrily out of his bedroom worrying for a moment that he wouldntbe able to find his way down before a large set of stairs unfolded themselves before him he pranced down them daintily like he had the time of day then followed the noise of the morning until he found his family lily and erin were giggling around the worktop in their bright and sunny kitchen wearing pastel house dresses and flowery aprons good morning harry grinned in the doorway good morning sunshine morning harry did you sleep well lily asked putting pasty bowels into the sink you dontlook as peaky as you did yesterday well he slept for long enough erin giggled you missed dinner i was just tired from the train journey harry smiled watching his mother flutter about her kitchen i sure they re working you too hard lily sighed they never gave us the amount of homework you get when your dad and i were at hogwarts of course they did dear james grinned from the backdoor we just never did it james potter smiled his way inside from the cold and put a large bunch of yellow roses in the vase on the kitchen table harry wondered for a moment how he could have picked fresh roses on a snowy winter day before he decided to ponder on it later speak for yourself lily frowned taking a steaming tray of cupcakes out of the large toasty oven i did all my homework but there are certain way of getting out of it james cheekily told his children especially if you re a prefect or of course a marauder but i not a marauder dad erin pouted at her father as she sadly picked up a wooden spoon of course you are princess james replied you re a little marauder angel your mother was ours back in my time we found we needed a little feminine influence someone to talk us out of some of the crazy things we planned to do but erin doesntdo that harry mocked she usually talks us into them breakfast was as pleasant as it could have been and after five slices of warm buttered toast harry sat watching his mother and sister absentmindedly with a smile lily and erin were making chocolate chip fairy cakes they smelled like the sweetest vanilla and were topped with thick coats of green or purple icing harry thought they were wonderful what do you reckon harry erin asked brightly silver or gold sprinkles gold he replied definitely the gold good choice when it reached about midday harry excused himself from the kitchen and returned to his bedroom the place where his mind had been lingering the photos on the wall were just as haunting as before and even more enchanting harry came across a favorable picture of himself and erin who could be barely 3 and 4 years old harry wore a t shirt with a duck on it and erin had a black ribbon in her wisps of thick red hair cute werentwe erin chuckled as she let herself inside quite the pair people used to think we were twins harry looked from erin hazel oval eyes to his green oval eyes they both looked so much like their mother s bet you haventfound the best photo yet though erin grinned in a tease as she danced to harry cupboard opened the door and pulled out a life size picture of ginny you have to be joking harry laughed as his sister lent ginny up against the wall nope erin replied you had this made and behind our parents ginny and the marauder backs i the only other person who knows about it harry eyed the large picture wearily before shoving it under his bed and sitting down he reached slowly inside his trouser pocket and extracted the crumpled picture of ginny on the swing he examined it why do i have so many pictures of her harry stressed fingering the creases am i some sort of a stalker in this world no erin laughed you re just in love if you like you can blame your weird obsession on me i started it how harry asked by taking your very first picture of her erin explained it was your first day at hogwarts and i came to the station with my camera ginny was in the background of one of the pictures i took of course when you saw her it was love at first sight the first letter i got from you from hogwarts you demanded all the photos so you could check if she was in any that madness harry stated that you erin smiled harry put the picture on his bedside cabinet and laid down do you think your harry will ever get her harry asked distantly i dontknow erin said sitting down beside him i would have said no until i met you and your ginny what do we have to do with it harry questioned you re the same people you know erin smiled just from different worlds and you and your ginny seem so perfect for each other so i dontsee why my harry and ginny shouldntbe harry shifted in his bed uncomfortably you kissed her didntyou erin stated that night at the ball how d you know harry asked sitting slowly up i could just feel it erin said looking thoughtfully out of the window and see it harry thought back to what erin had told him some weeks ago about auras and wondered in that was what she meant what should i do about ginny harry asked lightly erin was so easy to talk to and harry suddenly had no problems opening up do you like her i dontknow well until then there not a lot you can do erin shrugged swinging her legs maybe you should go over there see how she doing she wasnta happy bunny on the train as you know harry grimaced at the memory of ginny flouncing away after he d shunted her he hadntmeant to he just didntwant to worry her yet now all thoughts of voldemort seemed to have floated away maybe i will pop by harry said it canthurt that the spirit erin cheered as she jumped up from harry bed and wandered towards an open box of honeydukes candy may i you know how i love sweets harry chuckled be my guest it was perhaps an hour later when harry was finally washed and dressed he was wearing smart jeans and trainers with a clean shirt and green sweater vest erin had picked it out for him reminding him of how ginny loved them whilst he d gelled his hair the two children charged down the stairs and into the kitchen to find their parents rushing about franticly in work robes we ve got to go out kids james explained as he threw on his clock the ministry have just called very important it nothing to worry about though lily insisted as she clipped her hair back just a little task the ministry just wants as many aurors out as possible i thought you booked christmas off erin said slumping disappointedly into a kitchen chair i sorry baby lily sighed but it important we wont be long james reminded them as he picked up his case order in some dinner and make sure you get to bed at a reasonable time we will erin droned i so sorry we have to work lily apologized as she picked up the floo powder we ll make it up to you we promise james added as his wife kissed each child in turn goodbye lily said and they were gone well that that erin sighed slipping off her trademark black boots i going to go and do some crystal gazing i dontfeel like going out now have fun at the weasleys harry watched erin grimly slum away into the shadows before picking up the floo powder after a whirl and rush of soot harry arrived at the burrow at least that where he hoped he was as the room he d arrived in was quite different from the one he remembered there was no clutter or mess in the room and the furniture wasntworn or mismatched there were no knitting needles around either or chess pieces and that burnt spot where fred had dropped an exploding tea cake on the rug had vanished in fact so had the rug this room was clean and grand on the floor was a rich burgundy carpet the ceiling a chandelier and the walls paintings around the edges of the room were neat cream couches with tassels and a glass coffee table to each on the left a sculpture of a lion the right a black family tapestry the only reason harry knew he was in the burrow was because the family clock still hung on the wall and because ron was running down the stairs harry his redheaded friend yelled excitedly what are you doing here just thought i d come by harry smiled at ron grin thought i d see how you were doing now bad ron said opening his arms out to his sides i live in a palace i d have to agree harry chuckled as they flopped into large cream couches how your house ron asked placing his feet up on a matching cream foot stall it a mansion thank you very much harry declared and it not too shabby good ron nodded before whispering and your parents great harry assured him i couldntbe happier of course harry knew that was a lie he could certainly could be happier and would be once he d talked with a certain someone harry was sure he d find the redhead in question tucked away in her room yet asking for her would only bring up the subject harry was most avoiding so how erin ron asked scratching for a conversation i surprised she didnttag along she was going to but then mum and dad had to go to work harry explained she got a bit upset and went to her room i suppose she doesntget to see them often more the you do ron said and harry grabbed the opportunity to casually ask so where ginny ron chuckled ah yeah she in her room he explained been up there since we got back you really put her in a bad mood on the train what did i do harry asked shaking his head i dead serious i dontunderstand erin said she was mad with me but i dontsee why she should be if she has a problem she should just come out with it and calm it mate ron said seriously kicking his footstall away i dontknow why she mad at you from the way you were at the ball i figured you d be her favorite person in the world by now harry turned his head away look if you want to talk about it i all ears ron said as comfortingly as he could be i was a bit mad at first but then hermione talked to me and now i all for it i d rather it be you then anyone else i dontknow harry sighed picking at his jeans the large lounge door slid noisily open and the youngest weasley appeared round the edge she wore tight straight jeans a pretty white blouse and wavy wet red hair mum tea parties running over ginny stated lazily taking no notice of harry she said we ve got to get the house elves to sort out our dinner ourselves they re waiting in the parlor she slipped effortlessly back into the other room and slammed the door shut once more great harry cursed she isnteven speaking to me oh come on mate ron encouraged nudging harry in the shoulder just talk to her if you asked her out she wouldntsay no but i dontknow if that what i want harry stressed as he left his chair and began pacing around what do you mean ron asked you like her dontyou of course i like her harry grumbled as more then a friend kind of do you love her i dontknow do you find her attractive very harry said before stopping where hermione when you need her i ve been asking myself the very same thing ron mused taking an ornament off the table and shining it she at home she wontbe coming over until christmas eve great harry mumbled kicking at the fireplace just when i need her nagging advice she not here well dontask me what to do ron insisted replacing the china piece i ve got the emotional capacity of a teaspoon or whatever i surprised hermione even puts up with me i surprised you two even figured out you liked each other harry moaned you re both impossibly stubborn and entirely blind when it comes to each other you cantsee what right in front of your nose neither can you ron chuckled and harry face went blank you really dontsee it do you you re just as bad as i am how w what harry stuttered ginny ron grinned you love her ginny harry thought aloud as the living room door opened again ginny hurry up ron ginny insisted as she flew across the room some of us would like to eat today it not my fault mum has these stupid tea parties and forgets to feed her children ron shouted after her as she began to climb the stairs harry started to follow her ginny could we dontyou even start the fiery red head cursed at him pointing accusingly donttalk to harry like that ron raged take your anger out on someone else he our guest i aware or that ronald ginny said spitefully digging her nails into the rail and i ll treat him with some decency when he treats me with some decency ginny bolted up the remaining stairs then charged to her bedroom slamming her door so loudly that you must have been able to here it at least 10 houses away what just happened here ron simpered falling back into his chair it felt like a slap in the face harry said sadly except a slap in the face doesnthurt on the inside ron exhaled loudly and harry ran a shivered hand through his hair ginny never spoken to me like that before harry said to himself well get used to it ron stated ordinarily climbing up from his couch you think i ve got a temper well now you re seen it i going to go and sort out dinner what do you want ginny harry sighed remember to review the lucky

either way they are everywhere in future chapters so dontfret as i ve put up two chapters i need 35 reviews before i update hehehe chapter 4 laying low harry woke up to the light autumn breeze blowing across his face and the sound of birds singing he smiled a yawn and rolled out of bed then strolled to the familiar window the sky was a clear blue and the sun was a distant figure the air was cool and the breeze comforting it was the perfect day for quidditch harry took a relaxed shower and put on a set of clothes from his wardrobe today he chose some ripped jeans a black t shirt and a plain black robe he ran some gel through his hair before getting his broom out from under his bed he walked over to the window and without any notice jumped straight out of it he kicked his leg over the broom and floated in mid air a few feet above the ground he took a breath of fresh air before zooming through the heavens again he flew around the towers and over the gardens he skimmed the top of the trees in the forbidden forest and flew around the quidditch pitch he flew down over the lake low enough for him to reach the water and he let his fingers skim the surface he stopped when he reached the ground and stepped off of his broom over the other side of the lake he saw a beautiful figure she wore a long white dress and robe and had long wavy golden hair before harry had a good look at her she was gone she flew off over the forbidden forest and into its dark depths harry returned back to his dorm room he laid his broom gently down and collapsed onto his bed this world was weird first he popular then he has a sister and now he was sure he had just seen an angel harry thought back to his sister he really had a sister he d always wanted a sibling but it never seemed possible harry walked over to his desk and picked up the picture of himself and his father he had a family just that moment the dormitory room door swung open and in strolled the missing marauders they were carrying plates of cakes tubs of ice cream and bottles of drinks you re finally up then sleeping beauty seamus grinned harry nearly told seamus that he was up before them but thought the better of it we just thought we d stock up dead said from seeing the look on harry face fair enough harry said and raised his eyebrows harry gasped he waked over to the mirror and raised his eyebrows again he now knew why his sister looked familiar when she raised her eyebrows he did the exact same thing the thought sent shivers down harry spine you alright mate ron asked showing a little concern i brought you up a plate of brekkie if you want it thanks ron harry said and grinned so what the plan for today prongsie seamus asked while opening a tub of lime ice cream no plan harry said as he tucked into his breakfast i thinking we should lay low for a bit after the whole filch monster girly snape incident you may have a good point there dean said at the moment they have no proof it was us exactly harry agreed i say we leave it till at least lunch give us time to catch up on the ladies seamus said slyly yea you haventseen your bird since friday have you paddy dean added i dontthink so ron said hesitantly well ron can see her later because first we have something we have to do harry announced see you later wormtail moony harry and ron left the dormitory climbed down the stairs and made their way swiftly through the common room harry kept an eye out for his sister but she was nowhere to be seen once they were out of ear shot harry explained what he had on his mind i want to find my sister again harry said purposefully i dontknow anything about her i donteven know her name sure we can look for her ron said i dontthink she was in the common room no harry said she wasn t and she wasntoutside yesterday she must be inside the castle somewhere talking of sisters you haventseen mine have you ron asked no harry said shaking his head but i wouldntworry she ll turn up so have you got the map ron asked of course harry said and took the marauders map out of his pocket he rolled out the scruffy old map and after a few well chosen words pictures started to appear on it harry read through every name on the map yet the only potter inside hogwarts was himself he reread all the names which was difficult as they all kept moving finally he gave up it just doesntmake any sense harry said sitting down on the steps outside the great hall where could she be maybe we should go and tell dumbledore she missing ron suggested we can t harry sighed i might have misheard maybe i donthave a sister we cantboth have misheard ron said she must be your sister she looks just like you well i guess we might as well head back to the common room harry sighed standing up yea ron said looking at the map well look on the bright side at least i found ginny harry took the map from ron and found a little dot labeled ginevra weasley in the library lets go then harry said despondently you re not going anywhere a cranky voice said it was filch he was holding a dirty bucket of water and some cloths you have detention filch grinned menacingly at the boys or had you forgotten they looked down at their feet they had forgotten you ll be cleaning out the trophies in the trophy room filch said handing ron and harry the equipment and you had better do a thorough job i wouldntwant a reason to give you another detention now would i boys harry and ron shook their heads before leaving swiftly for the trophy room when the boys got there the glass doors to the trophy cupboards were already open they put down their buckets took out their cloths and started work an hour later they were almost finished they had worked great as a team and had got through the work faster than they had expected now all that was left was a few of the largest trophies at the far end of the room i think filch is going soft ron smiled as he chose a large silver trophy to clean i know harry grinned this hasntbeen nearly as bad as i thought it would be harry looked in the middle of the trophies and found the large quidditch cup it shiny and gold and by far the largest trophy he walked up to his large familiar friend and began to clean the surface he read the engravings to himself as he cleaned gryffindor harry grinned reading his house name on the winning trophy harry potter ronald weasley seamus finnigan dean thomas katie bell ginevra weasley and erin potter harry dropped his cloth on the floor ron harry said in a soft voice i think i ve found my sister remember as i ve put up two chapters i need 35 reviews before i update hehehe a n here the full chapter yes it been ages i suck i still carrying on with this story even though it doesntmake sense with hbp but i will adapt it as best i can thank you for all your lovely reviews or perhaps your not so lovely reviews i cantbring myself to read them i feel too guilty about taking so long to update but still thank you ma x chapter 41 merry christmas erin a strong ray of winter sunshine shone through harry window and woke him from his unsettled slumber the ruffled boy stirred a little rolling over to hide the light before something hit him it was christmas day harry rammed on his warmest slippers grabbed his red flannel dressing gown and headed straight to erin room the little redhead was sleeping tangled on top of her duvet her body was shaken and clammy her hair fell in thick blood red bangs over her face and her fairy sleeved pyjamas laid smoothly over her body she mumbled darkly in her sleep and squinted her eyes a little as harry entered take me away please i scared the potter brother took a seat on the edge of the bed and wiped her hair away wake up erin he smiled it morning they ve all gone the little girl wrestled in her dreams for a moment kicking in her shiny black quidditch boots harry laughed she always seemed to be wearing those w what harry erin said wiping her eyes why are you laughing do you always sleep in your boots harry asked ignoring her question oh erin smiled looking admiringly at her feet no but i think i might do in future they have kept my feet nice and warm harry hit erin round the head with a pillow as she sat wiggling harry would imagine her toes i bet you wore those under your dress robes didntyou harry mocked as feathers flew over head as a matter of fact i did erin replied indignantly now would you mind telling me why you re bothering me at this unearthly hour first of all it not an unearthly hour it past noon harry explained and secondly it christmas day so i thought you d like to christmas erin squealed leaping out of her nest where are my slippers we need to get downstairs why in hogwarts did i sleep in today i usually up bright and early erin hopped across her room untying the laces on her shoes before something dawned on her and her face dropped where are mum and dad she ordered her complexion paling are they ok i think so harry said sitting his immobile sister down and tending to her boots i heard them come in last night so they must be well enough otherwise they d be at st mungo s i guess neither sibling spoke for a moment harry slipped fluffy rabbit slippers onto erin feet and she sat motionless harry had never seen her to be so still he wondered if she was even breathing do you do you know what they are erin asked unsteadily not meeting her brothers eyes what death eaters she knelled is it another name for dementors it did feel cold when the lights went out no harry chimed climbing uncomfortably to his feet dementors werentcoming last night not dementors and who is bellatrix harry stood startled that she d remembered the name she s draco malfoy aunt harry was expecting another string of questions as erin wobbled to her feet but they didntcome she seemed to except harry answer and began gliding towards the door come on then erin said finally turning with a smile as she reached for the doorknob we need to get mum and dad up we ve got presents to open within minutes harry was shoved into his parents large suite lily and james slept soundlessly peacefully harry had hardly seen a scene so tranquil before their room was a warm peach colour somewhat matching erin pyjamas they slept in the largest most comfortable looking bed james with his arms warmly around his wife wake up erin yelled like a child climbing onto their cocoon wake up it christmas day james smiled sleepily get up dad mum she pleaded again before turning to her brother come on harry i need your help harry hesitated before kneeling on the end of the bed looking wistfully at his parents this would be a christmas he d never forget the only christmas he d ever have with his family come on harry erin smiled feigning defeat they can meet us downstairs within an hour all the potter children presents had been opened which harry found almost impossible to comprehend as they d gotten so many harry had received new red dress robes muggle attire books red and gold quidditch robes with potter on the back quidditch shirts and shoes socks with wiggly broomsticks masses of hair gel and a shiny red practise snitch among other things erin opened identical quidditch robes to harry a pot of glittery purple ink a fancy quill a new crystal ball a whole quidditch ensemble including a pleated skirt vest top and pe knickers and some extra squeaky shoe polish for her boots of course their favourite presents were their broomsticks harry was greatly surprised when he unwrapped the spangled lemon paper to reveal a handsome new phoenix 500 it was top of the range erin had told him along with her raven 260 would you mind if me and harry go for a fly erin asked as harry slipped a chocolate frog into his mouth of course not lily smiled motherly just be back in time for dinner harry and erin looked wickedly at each other before starting an unspoken race for the door the winter air was chilling against their faces and made their skin crawl the sky was a crispy grey and the sun a mismatching yellow it looked like a dandelion misplaced in a black and white movie it was an accident a mistake the rest of the garden took on a fresh but unpleasant graveness which made harry glad to get up in the air harry and erin flew for what seemed like an eternity neither took responsibility for the time everything was easier up in the air so free erin was a great partner for flying it was like her second nature she flew so gallantly so gladly and so sure harry could only think of one other girl who flew as well as erin and that was ginny with ginny it was different though she always looked so carefree like she wasnteven trying harry figured she probably wasn t the children took rough landings after a race around the tree tops and flopped onto the garden bench well that was brilliant erin grinned reminding harry somewhat of ron definitely harry replied running his fingers down the spine of his new racing broom it wasnthalf bad though he did prefer the control of his firebolt should we head back in erin asked squelching her soggy slippers i got a cool new chess set i d like to try out yeah but in a minute harry replied with a flick of his wand and the murmur of an overused spell the potter boy summoned a small roughly wrapped package it floated meekly out of the nearest bedroom window and straight into harry hands for you he smiled presenting it to erin she ripped off the paper with skill and produced a shiny gold necklace the chain was thin and delicate and upon the chain was a locket on the locket a bolt of lightening dontyou think you should be giving this kind of thing to ginny erin asked raising an eyebrow i mean it beautiful so beautiful i bought it for you harry said simply i never had a sister until a few weeks ago and i guess that makes me see how special you are merry christmas erin the redhead hugged her brother tightly thank you she sighed opening the locket to see a picture of the two of them that not all harry continued i placed a charm on this locket a safety charm so you can contact me anytime you re in danger all you have to do is tap it with your wand and say obscura then my necklace will heat up and i ll know erin looked up at her brother with an unreadable expression there are going to be times when i ll need this necklace arentthere she asked seriously suddenly looking cold and frail you ve not bought this just incase no harry replied looking straight ahead not being able to meet her eyes i ve bought this for when not if i leaving one for your other brother too come on it getting cold let go inside after changing for dinner into a clean shirt and trousers harry took an invisible seat in the potter kitchen lily stewed over pots and trays sounding more exasperated by the moment before james lent a helping hand let me do this he insisted leaning over her to stir the gravy why dontyou go and have a rest go have a bath with that smelly stuff i got you lady behind the counter at bonnie bounty bubbles said it fantastic the foam changes colour and everything lily smiled gratefully at her husband before slipping from his grasp and exiting the kitchen so how has your christmas been so far harry james asked broadly tending to the feast do you like your new broom oh err yeah harry stuttered having not been sure his father had noticed him there it great really fast a step up from your old firebolt eh james joked when you wrote to me saying you didntwant a new broom i thought you d turned ill i was wondering who you were and what you d done with my son i not just all about broomsticks dad harry snapped there is more to me then that more to me then flying and fun james potter turned to face his son with wide hazel eyes i know that he said i ve always known from the moment you were born i knew there was something special about you already you ve made me more proud then i ever thought i d be and you re only 17 years old you ve got so much ahead of you 17 years is a long time harry argued a lot can happen in 17 years 17 years can be a lifetime what if i donthave the world ahead of me then i ll always be proud of what you ve achieved james smiled honestly you re quidditch captain you made seeker in your first year your grades are some of the highest in hogwarts you fought off a basilisk harry i hear you re an animagus too though i dare ask you to transform while your mothers around she d kill me she never liked the idea of you learning before harry could notice james had returned to his cooking again dad he croaked in the back of his throat his father stopped still merry christmas erin appeared in a flurry of excitement only minutes later soon followed by lily they both wore tartan pleated skirts warm woolly tights and cardigans harry had always thought that erin and lily were near on identical but putting them side by side harry noticed that erin looked more like their father she shared harry and james nose only a smaller version it was mainly her sleek red hair which made her look so much like lily merry christmas all a jolly voice barked from the hallway sirius erin ran and gave the grinning man a large bear hug and how is my favourite goddaughter he asked with a rather charming grin sirius erin said with her hands on her hips i your only goddaughter so much like her mother sirius commented to james who smiled both men joined in a festive embrace then sirius hugged lily too food smells great lils he said taking a seat been out flying yet harry yeah just been he replied so how does the phoenix go i ve heard it pretty slick remus lily hugged the new arrival who smiled at her gently james joined them how are you moony the potter grinned leading him to the table you look pretty rough well after last night lupin replied i guess it to be expected two pairs of young eyes stuck blankly on remus and silence filled the room harry erin james began wearily maybe you should go to his voice led off as he looked at the serious expressions on his children faces james lily said somewhat worriedly how about you and the boys go to the front room dinners nearly ready go on harry harry followed the men who situated themselves around the table in the largest room of the house sirius solemnly sparked up the fire so have you heard anything else james asked remus and sirius not yet lupin sighed apparently death eaters do celebrate christmas doubtful sirius barked picking at the table cloth i at least know some of them don t a thick silence fell over the marauders none bearing to meet the others eyes what happened last night asked harry just at that moment lily chose to enter the front room levitating steaming pots and trays everything ready the red headed woman smiled setting down the food expertly erin bringing in the plates harry dear would you fetch the crackers they re on top of the cabinet harry looked mistily around the room for a moment before he spiked up his wand accido christmas crackers 12 crimson ribbon tied treats flew from across the room and rocketed into harry arms resourceful always been a clever one sirius remarked looking at harry with the fondest grin and always a lazy one too james added as his son scrambled to pick up the crackers which had darted into the gravy pitcher lily and erin took seats either side of harry and the glasses before them simultaneously filled with what looked suspiciously like wine i d like to make a toast said james raising his drink to family and friends the people that mean the most to us lets make the most of our company as dark times may lie ahead let us never forget what it is to live carefree and remember not to be so carefree that we forget to live to love and life sirius concluded following james to love and life they chorused each companion drunk to their hearts content before breaking into hearty conversation sirius bellowed a joke about a warlock and a hinkeypunk remus and lily pulled a cracker of fluttering stars james put a kings crown lopsidedly into his head wiping a bout of magenta glitter onto the floor jousting at erin as she tried to catch a yellow pigmy puff in her bare hands harry felt oddly dispensed from the group picking at his food with a cold knife each jolly voice swam into another and as the family filled their plates with sweet meats and jam harry felt oddly cold without his weasley jumper after the desserts had been cleaned away erin excused her from the table insisting that she needed some time to try out her new crystal ball the ones at school are so dirty she d exclaimed it a miracle that i manage to see anything in them at all i reckon it a miracle that anyone sees anything in those glass balls james had replied as she d left i dontsee the fun in them a short but fairly interesting conversation had followed erin departure james and lily had taken great pride in recalling all the times erin had made correct premonitions before moving onto harry flying talents this was when harry had excused himself too after asking his mother if she needed any help cleaning up oh dontbe silly harry had taken a seat at the far end of the living room in a rather comfortable arm chair after a moments careful consideration he extracted a royal blue diary from his pocket i ve only been back at school for a month and it somehow feels like a lifetime harry read in lily voice i have a feeling that my final year at hogwarts is going to fly by it a shame as i enjoying myself more then ever the marauders have tamed down somewhat and i think it mainly due to james he changed somehow yet i cantreally place it he still himself but i cantseem to find anything to be mad at him for i think he turned over a new leaf oh merlin i really shouldntspeak too soon i bet i ll end up eating my words now i hope he stays this way though but i wont keep my hopes up we ve only been at school a month there still plenty of time for him to disappoint me harry took a digesting breath as he turned over the page and found the next entry to be written in a slanted scrawl which wasnthis mothers dontworry lily i wontdisappoint you that is if you dontcount me reading your diary as disappointing you it not my fault after all as you have left it in the middle of the common room you ought to be more careful lils you never know who could come across it snivellus and tell all your secrets about how gorgeous you think i am and dontroll your eyes at me miss evans it rude but on a serious note dontworry about this year lily it going to be the best one yet padfoot says hi love always james harry chuckled a little as he ran his index finger down the margin wondering what on earth his mother would have had to say about that harry couldntimagine what ginny would do if she found that harry had etched a lengthy entry in her diary it would but bad though as diary were obviously a sore point with ginny james potter i appreciate the sentiment i assure you but reading my private property was it was it made me feel comforted oh my i was just about to give you a piece of my mind in my diary of all places but now i not so sure that i mad at you i should be you know that right the thing is i suddenly not how do you know that this years going to be the best one yet i have an odd feeling about this year perhaps i just at ill ease over your sudden kindness have you noticed anything i just have this gut feeling that something isntright oh and potter you ll find no love notes and poems about yourself in here if you want to read a diary from a girl who pining over you try marlene mckinnon i believe she refers to you as that brown eyed angel you wouldntbelieve the amount of times i ve had to tell her your eyes are hazel harry smiled as he closed the slightly rumpled pages of lily diary and inclined his head to the other side of the front room only sirius james and remus remained at the table lily had since disappeared and erin had made no reappearance there was only a candle dim hue of light living in the room which hovered around the men like it was attracted to their heat and skimmed the butter beer with a clean shine there was no clock on the mantle or the wall but harry was sure it was late in the evening as he made his way over to the gathering and i told prewett sirius laughed i told him that they were off the back of a broomstick that mundungus had done a dirty deal i warned him they were inbred with kneazles well what did he say james asked chucking at his mince pie he said sirius continued that it didntbother him one bit a puffskein a punskein and his niece wouldntknow the difference it was only a week later when the creature ate her pyjamas that he decided to take it back the three marauders drunk to their mirth as harry pulled out a seat beside them smiling at half a joke the secluded cold feeling he d felt earlier had some how elapsed and a seldom feeling of warmth now filled his stomach he such a simple man lupin said fondly but i ve always liked gideon prewett the warmth died away in an instant harry looked from beaming face to beaming face longing for a sign of sadness or anything similar he groped for something he could relate to gideon prewett was dead so what brings up to our table son james asked with a ruddy face erm the butterbeer mostly harry said masked but also your fine hospitality good answer sirius replied conjuring an opener reckon he can have a bottle right a whole bottle remus joked now you ve been known for your generosity james laughed he can drink what he wants if you dontmind sharing james told sirius he is of age after all i keep forgetting sirius admitted clipping off a cap it seems like only yesterday you were just starting hogwarts oh shut up sirius harry barked ice melting again well it true sirius grinned handing him his drink and now you re in your last year you re an animagus merlin james cut in slapping his forehead so his spectacles jumped i never asked you harry what is your animagus form a stag he grinned shyly as his fathers face lit up like a christmas tree is it really james asked looking from harry to remus it is lupin replied grandly he a true prongs and he picked the other marauders well too your padfoot ron weasley his patronus is a dog isntit yeah harry said yeah it is well there you have it sirius barked taking a hearty swig i say we have another toast the other scrambled for their bottles fiercely and raised them to the marauders past and present sirius cheered to prongs harry and james grinned mooney remus nodded padfoot and wormtail who is no longer with us may wormtail rest in peace lupin added sensitively yes james added strongly to peter pettigrew may he be happy wherever his mischief has taken him harry lowered his bottle before the toast could be made feeling poisoned by how fondly they had spoken of such a traitor he was hurt at how pure his fathers voice had sounded as he had whispered peter name if only they knew the only comfort harry had was that the slimy man was dead he drank to that the sour feeling harry had on the inside must have leaked through onto his face for at that moment remus turned almost sullenly to him is something wrong harry the boy froze no he replied i just i was just thinking lupin obviously saw this as a dangerous lead for he turned to sirius swiftly we should probably go now lupin said rising from the table nymph will be wondering where i ve gotten to and i sure marlene would like her husband back at some point sirius chuckled you re right he said putting his beer down marey should be back form her parents house by now so i should go and see the missis harry almost missed his mouth as he tried to take another sip of his drink the idea of sirius married jammed into his head why did it seem such an odd idea are you leaving lily asked perfectly as she poked her head around the door harry found her timing uncanny yeah sorry lils sirius said pulling a winter fleece over his head the old ball and chain beckons that alright lily smiled joining her husband by the arm tell marlene i ll see her at lunch next week and remus send nymphadora my love i will lily lupin smiled the four adults drew healthily towards the fireplace a jolly ending threatening to prevail before a silver face snapped into the fireplace good evening dumbledore said his tone serious i hate to interrupt your festivities but i afraid your party must end here there has been another attack we need you now a panicked graveness swept over the pack as they all jolted into action james shot robes out of the closet sirius and remus grabbed their wands and lily fastened her hair back where the outburst james growled tossing clothes just outside hogsmeade and the women sirius and remus froze half dressed mrs black and mrs lupin are on their way there dumbledore said they will meet with you and the others by hogsmeade station what about the children albus lily asked throwing on her cloak harry and erin will need to leave now godric hollow is no longer safe dumbledore knelled they must take leave away from here perhaps at mr and mrs weasley house you will find the longbottom are not home harry rose carefully from his chair as the others rushed around his eyes never leaving dumbledore face is he here harry asked unnoticed i mean there dumbledore looked though his half moon spectacles and surveyed harry with mild interest he is here harry the old man replied before lily pulled harry out of the room the potter boy ran madly up the old staircase and took a left before jogging away to erin bedroom he opened the door swiftly knocking an ink bottle to the ground before turning to his sister who stood stiffly in the centre of her bedroom eyes hollow crystal ball forgotten erin you d better grab a jacket we ve got to go to erin calmly scooped up a neat pile of pyjamas off her dresser before leaving the room without a word she was wearing winter robes her wand a arms length and harry found it odd that she d reached the door before he d finished his sentence chapter 5 reunion harry sat at the dinner table half listening to the conversations around him he couldntconcentrate properly his mind weaved in and out of daydreams daydreams of his family at the beach and playing games in the back garden every now and again he would poke his head out and look down the table for erin she hadntturned up for lunch harry was just about to leave when a flick of red hair made him jump hey bro erin called as she walked by him wearing what harry would imagine was her usual smile hey harry called back before turning with a smile to ron you alright potter dean asked yea harry smiled i was just worried about her earlier i was using the marauders map and i couldntfind her name on it oi erin dean called down the table hmmm came his reply where were you earlier dean questioned that private business erin said tapping her nose why did you miss me hardly dean said and added to harry she was probably at hogsmeade yea seamus agreed ever since you showed her that passage to honeydukes it the only place she goes she does love her sweets our erin dean grinned and continued with his lunch well i going for a walk harry declared and left the table for the rest of the daytime harry spent his time outside he wandered around alone at first but was soon joined by many admirers harry had never liked attention before but was finding that he didntmind it anymore these people liked him for him and not because he had a scar on his forehead after socializing harry spent the rest of his time before dinner flying he had a friendly game with some ravenclaws and a few slytherins too harry expected the slytherins to play dirty but they actually played a very clean game harry was surprised to find that they were really very nice and he even managed to have a friendly conversation with derrick about keeping after that he did a few laps of the field to keep the girls happy they applauded after harry did a sharp dive and made harry feel really special he even tried to help a few of them to fly and took hannah abbot for a ride by the time it came to dinner harry was thoroughly worn out he slouched in his chair and rested his head on his shoulder until ron poked him what harry groaned look ron whispered it hermione ron was right it was hermione but not the one they remembered hermione wore a pleated denim skirt which was far too short to be anything that hermione would usually have worn she wore a powder pink gypsy top which flashed her stomach and powder pink sandals her hair was almost the same as usual the only change was that it looked a lot neater and shinier another shocking thing was that she wore make up she wondered down the gap between the two tables and appeared to be looking for somebody shall i call her over harry asked ron no it probably not a good idea ron said thinking back to what hermione had said about them not being friends it fine ron dean said honestly hey hermione hermione noticed the group of boys and made her way over to them choosing a seat next to ron hey she smiled prettily hiya bookworm seamus grinned you alright hermie dean asked casually never been better she smiled sweetly and picked up a roll what have you been up to then ron asked just wondering around with lav and pav hermione said simply enjoying the good weather we should all make the most of it ron said nodding winter will be here quicker than you think tell me about it hermione sighed ron was about to cut in with something witty when he noticed some girls staring daggers at hermione have you fallen out with them or something ron asked pointing down to the girls hermione shook her head confused they keep giving you evil looks harry elaborated oh hermione said and turned round to look well they look ok now dinner gradually cleared away and was replaced with dessert there was apple pie strawberry cheese cake chocolate gateau and more the marauders helped themselves to pie while hermione chose a chocolate clair that a tiny clair ron said looking at hermione bowl arentyou hungry i on a diet hermione said shrugging her shoulders you dontneed to go on a diet ron said outraged oh no seamus and dean chorused making it clear that this was a regular argument in this world well i like to watch my weight hermione said plainly but you really dontneed to ron argued but i like to you ll make yourself sick of you donteat enough what right do you have to tell me what i eat i just looking out for you well don t let me get you a bigger clair no and without warning hermione stuffed the whole chocolate clair into her mouth and swallowed it it was amazing how she managed to do it in such a ladylike manner any other person would have got it everywhere the only mess she made was a tiny bit of cream which was sitting on the tip of her nose ron chuckled when he saw the cream and wiped it off the end of hermione angry little nose with his finger she saw what he was doing and smiled he smiled too dean and seamus were rolling their eyes over the other side of the table harry didntunderstand why after dinner was finished the group headed back to gryffindor common room they all slouched in chairs around the fire and made lazy conversation they played games and read magazines without a care in the world harry wished that it would stay like this forever he was just about to fall asleep when he heard dean making a suggestion as we have nothing better to do dean said i propose we have a game or truth or dare many heads around the fire nodded make it double dare ron said unsurely but recovered by adding i not in the mood to spill my guts out double dare it is then dean grinned evilly so who up first i ll start seamus volunteered harry i dare you to flash the next group of girls who enter the common room hey harry objected i dontshow just anyone the good stuff a few people laughed ok dean said just moon someone then excepting the compromise harry chose a group of girls and regretfully did the deed he ran back to the fireplace and was surprised to find that one of the girls he had mooned had fainted he laughed it off but was highly embarrassed ok dean harry chose your dare is to go and burp in parvati face dean jumped up with no hesitation ran to parvati and did his business he then finished off by doing a large bow now i choose dean grinned hermione hermione bit her lip and slid down in her chair hermione you must let me and seamus choose you and outfit to wear then parade around the common room in it like a muggle model dean explained oh no hermione protested oh no oh no oh no oh yes seamus said as he dragged her from her seat with dean and took her up to her dorm ron and harry exchanged amused glances unsure if the hermione in this world would go along with the joke they knew the old hermione wouldnthave do you think she ll do it harry whispered to ron no ron said this hermione a lot more up for it but i still dontthink so how wrong ron was dean and seamus emerged from the girls staircase grinning from ear to ear ladies and gentlemen dean announced i would like to introduce you to sexy hermy hermione stepped out from the stairs and the crowd went wild she was wearing red hot pants with black fishnet tights on her bottom half on her top she wore a black boob tube with a sort of net cardigan on top her hair was hanging wildly and she wore deep red lipstick and black heels the boys all wooed as she strolled looking rather relaxed to the fire place so what do you think she asked the marauders seamus wolf whistled dean cheered and harry gave her the thumbs up what do you think ron she asked standing right in front of him he looked her up and down his face still in shock wow he said simply and all the boys cheered again well i going to go and finish my dare by parading my new outfit hermione said and left the group she went over and talked with a group of 6th year boys dean and seamus looked at hermione then at ron meaningfully ron just shrugged his shoulders and went back to his magazine but not before taking another peek at hermione the hours passed by and people started to head to bed harry and ron were in the middle of a game of chess so were naturally last to leave as they packed away the pieces they heard someone head down the stairs it was hermione still wearing her dare outfit she skipped over to a chair and picked up the book that was laying on it hi she smiled i didntrealize you were still down here yep ron said just packing up well you d better hurry it getting late hermione advised i bet you haventeven done your potions essay yet everyone froze hermione put her hand over her mouth her face in shock i mean she stammered not potions essay we donthave one i was never mind i dontknow what i talking about i do harry cut in your talking about the potions essay which is due in tomorrow hermione looked round suspiciously harry ron hermione said thinking do you know who the dark lord is v voldemort ron stuttered and harry lifted his hair to show his scar oh it really you two hermione exclaimed before pulling them both into a tight hug i didntrealize i thought i was the only one i was getting so worried no need to worry ron reassured her we re both here now i so relieved and look at me hermione laughed i would never have done this if i knew it was you hermione turned red we didntknow it was you either harry explained we never really thought you would do such a thing as that ron grinned in admiration well the hermione in this world is a lot more relaxed from what i can gather hermione said sitting down i thought i ought to play along it was kind of fun as well so you ve been playing a part since you go here ron asked we have too i noticed hermione said looking from their hair to their sports shoes i wish you didnthave to see me with all this make up on too i must look dreadful no you look nice ron said honestly what gave you the sudden change of heart lav and pav hermione sighed with a smile apparently the hermione in this world lets them do her hair and make up and choose her clothes the boys grinned well they have good taste harry said to cheer her up you looked good this morning thanks hermione grinned talking of mornings we d better go to bed yea ron yawned good night night harry said and began to climb the stairs hermione turned to ron you know what you said about my dare outfit she asked him biting her lip yea he answered unsurely did you mean it she asked in a small voice or were you just playing along ron looked hermione up and down then answered her oh i meant it he charmed with a cheeky grin then followed harry up the stairs chapter 6 monday harry sat in the great hall mindlessly watching his sister while eating his breakfast she looked so real her features were perfect like those of a china doll but her face was bright and full of life harry loved to watch her as she was so energetic she made him feel tired just looking at her ron and hermione marched into the hall side by side people gave them nasty looks as they joined harry at gryffindor table neither hermione nor ron had noticed so harry thought it would be best not to tell them you alright prongs ron said as he took a seat beside harry fine harry replied what do we have first lesson potions hermione groaned but before then i think we need to talk the boys looked at hermione and both nodded their heads after a swift breakfast they headed up to the owlery for some privacy so what is it ron sulked because he had been pulled away from his food we need to talk about how to get home she said emotionlessly how to get home ron asked do we have to of course we do hermione shrieked we cantjust stay in this other world forever why not ron asked kicking some hay with his foot it a lot nicer here we re popular i rich i have a girlfriend who hermione asked quickly i dontknow but i have one ron said it great here what do you think harry hermione asked with her arms crossed obviously expecting backup i with ron harry said plainly it perfect here and i think we deserve a break from the war a break is that what you think this is hermione exclaimed no i just harry mumbled before a silence filled the room i have a family here hermione i have parents a sister i dontwant to leave just yet hermione looked from harry pleading face to ron s she caved ok she said but we cantstay here forever we wont harry smiled dontworry i not running away from the war just taking a break from it i ve been under too much pressure and here here i can have fun carefree fun talking of fun did you see that prank we did ron grinned with excitement of course hermione said rolling her eyes i have to admit it was good thank you harry grinned and did a small bow now before we head to lessons i think there a few things you should know hermione stated i know since you got here you two have been pulling pranks and all sorts i on the other hand have been looking up history trust you to spend the whole time in the library ron said rolling his eyes i haventspent the whole time in the library hermione said defensively i just looked up some basic history i bet you didntknow that although there is no dark lord here there are death eaters death eaters harry questioned why why not she replied the death eaters are the same here as they were there the only difference is that here they can do very little because they have no master lucius malfoy became their leader 13 years ago for a short period of time before being murdered lucius is dead ron said that must be how i rich i know dad got promoted loads at the ministry he probably got promoted because there was no malfoy to put in a bad word for him exactly hermione grinned now i suggest we head to potions the trio strolled to potions but were met with a peculiar occurrence as they approached the door is that laughing ron asked they walked into the room to find the whole class laughing and joking over here seamus called we saved you some space the trio weaved through the hectic crowd and pulled seats around seamus and dean table where were you guys this morning dean asked owlery ron said coolly and no more questions were asked they chatted loudly for a few more minutes until a loud voice silenced them hey everyone it was sirius he wore a deep red robe and his hair tied back in a ponytail the smile he wore was genuine and his face looked young and pure many of the girls sighed as he entered the room much to the boys dismay today we are supposed to be doing a test sirius explained to the class sitting on top of his desk holding a pile of parchment but i dontlike tests if you ask me they suck the fun out of learning i can give you estimated newt grades without you lot having to do a test so here what i going to do sirius levitated the exam papers before blowing them to smithereens the whole class cheered and sirius laughed so instead i have set a potion for us to do sirius explained it quite a difficult one but i think you ll enjoy it sirius waved his wand and a set on instructions appeared on the board the potion we are going to complete today is the giddy potion it a potion which when taken makes the drinker giddy and dare i say it giggly sirius grinned at a group of girls who giggled it a potion usually given to people when they get depressed but i think i will do quite fine for today so lets get this party started harry ron and hermione skipped out of the class room two hours later with high spirits they had just had the best potions lesson imaginable sirius had put on some music while they worked and everybody had been singing and laughing non stop surprisingly nobody made a single mistake and every potion was perfect sirius was so proud that he dished out some chocolate frogs at the end of the lesson next lesson was care of magical creatures the trio were looking forward to seeing hagrid as they hadntseen him at all in this world which was strange considering his size they strolled comfortably towards hagrid cabin as the giddy potion wore off and took a place at the back of the crowd good morning class said a familiar voice but it wasnthagrid s good morning professor lupin chirped a blond hufflepuff boy at the front of the crowd the trio stood on tiptoe to see lupin over the crowd everyone sit down lupin smiled and the class sat down on the grass that better now today we are going to study unicorns i know we have briefly covered them before but this year we are going to actually feed and maybe ride them an approving murmur hung over the crowd that enough lupin warned now i would like the girls to come and see the unicorns first followed by the boys i have two silvery white ones which are nearly fully grown and three younger gold ones now girls follow me the lesson turned out to be possibly the best they had ever had the unicorns disliked the boys but were beautiful to watch from a distance anyway the only boy one unicorn did like was the blond hufflepuff who was at the front of the group earlier the unicorn let him feed her at the end of the lesson nobody wanted to leave they wanted to stay longer but lupin insisted he let the unicorns go back to the forbidden forest lavender and parvati asked if they could help walk them back but lupin declined their offer insisting that everyone should head to lunch the trio wandered back to the castle discussing the days events when harry noticed something hey isntthat neville harry asked pointing to the blond hufflepuff boy yea that is ron said in a hushed but surprised voice why isnthe in gryffindor maybe in this world he doesntfeel like he has to prove himself hermione suggested knowingly remember in our world he grew up with his gran who puts him down a lot she tells him he has to live up to the family name in this world he has parents who i sure love him no matter what then that settles it harry said this world is miles better then our world hermione went quiet for a moment i was thinking about maybe telling dumbledore hermione whispered you can t ron begged just give us a little longer the trio entered the great hall and sat themselves with the two missing marauders they were just enjoying a peaceful lunch when erin ran over hey bro she grinned i just booked us a quidditch practice for friday as you seem incapable of booking them is that ok fine he said looking at his fellow marauders great ok i ll go tell the others erin smiled then skipped away bonkers that one dean sighed bonkers but bloody gorgeous seamus admitted moony harry whined that my sister you re talking about like you re one to talk seamus said rolling his eyes harry didntcomment he wasntsure what seamus meant and decided to momentarily discard it the afternoon lessons for the trio were charms and transfiguration which were practically the same as before the only difference was that when the trio arrived all the girls looked dreamily at ron and harry and stared daggers at hermione also the boys all gawked at hermione harry could understand why he had never thought of hermione romantically but it was hard to miss her long legs with her short skirts ron waited until after school to comment on hermione clothes the trio were on their way to the kitchens to meet the other marauders when ron popped the question why are you dressing like that he asked almost too nicely what ever do you mean hermione asked playing dumb i mean your skirts are shorter than before ron blushed and your shirts are err smaller and you roll the sleeves up i never knew you were so observant hermione mused i just trying to keep in character unlike the two of you the other ron would have his shirt fully untucked and the other harry hair would be messier the boys adjusted themselves before tickling the pear and entering inside were seamus and dean surrounded by about 20 house elves we need 50 cream pies dean bellowed over the group and hurry up with them seamus ordered you cantjust order the house elves around like that hermione called angrily since when did you care dean asked since now hermione gulped then looked at ron and harry they both gave her meaningful looks never mind what re the pies for harry asked seamus who was reading a piece of parchment just another prank he said simply we re going to throw them at the slytherin quidditch team dean grinned that is once we get the flying catapults i ve got them a friendly voice called harry was surprised to see that it was erin she was wearing a denim skirt a yellow t shirt and her trademark boots and smile she levitated the catapults into the room and dropped them in front of dean who gave her a high five now all we need is the pies ron smiled hopefully elves dean bellowed how long till we get those pies just a few minutes i think a house elf with grey eyes said pinky will go check them now good seamus grinned then called you house elf hermione was ready to kill get me a drink would you seamus said some butter beer unless you got something stronger right away the house elf cried loopy will be right back in just a few minutes the pies were ready 25 house elves brought them out one in each hand they passed their pies to erin who counted them and passed them to the marauders 44 pies thanks lacey erin said towards the end 46 pies cheers blinky 48 pies pass them here browny and 50 including dandys how do you remember all their names ron asked pointing to the house elves dumbstruck and how do you know who is who they all look the same if you ask me you know i come to see the house elves a lot erin told ron how could i not know all their names he got a point erin dean agreed with ron there like a hundred of them but they all have their own personalities and feelings hermione cut in exactly erin sighed they re people too a large smile crept onto hermione face there was someone else who felt the same way as her she looked like christmas had come early some people just dontunderstand do they hermione asked erin no she said shaking her head well less about that seamus said rolling his eyes lets get this show on the road just as they were about to leave the kitchen door swung open and in strolled sirius well well well he grinned a look of pure amusement on his face what do we have here not 50 pies and 4 catapults erin grinned like a five year old dontyou try that with me he grinned at erin fluttering your eye lashes may work with your father but not with me i afraid erin shrugged her shoulders and walked away so what are you planning sirius asked whilst examining the catapults we were just going to fling some pies at the slytherin quidditch team professor black dean answered as you do fair enough sirius said nodding his head he poked his finger in the nearest pie and brought it out cream next time use cherry pies they make a bigger mess we ll keep that in mind ron said smiling well i d better be off sirius said picking up a mug of butterbeer i only came down for a drink if anyone asks i wasnthere you mean you arentgoing to stop us harry asked confused nah sirius said infact i think i might go and watch and you arentgoing to give us detention ron asked confused you ready think i would give the marauder jrs detention sirius asked and my own god children you ought to really hermione said crossing her arms probably sirius mused but i won t i just going to pretend i didntsee you if that ok sirius left the room chuckling to himself that man is a god dean grinned i know harry smiled they pie prank went brilliantly the slytherin got completely covered in pie and the whole school was laughing it was a prank which would go down in history a prank people would be talking about for years after dinner the marauders with the addition of erin and hermione lazed by the fire in the common room what a day erin sighed yea harry grinned i dontthink the slytherin are ever going to forgive us seamus mused our next quidditch match is definitely going to be interesting dean laughed i dread to think ron yawned well i going up to bed hermione announced me too erin said so i can get some peace and quiet and do some homework you re such a square dean exclaimed and erin poked her tongue out the girls headed off to bed leaving the boys in silence do you think we ought to do some homework seamus asked innocently we have an essay due in tomorrow for history of magic nah dean said closing his eyes history of magic is last lesson we still have time chapter 7 tuesday blues the trio wandered mindlessly towards the great hall it was a beautiful bright day and it seemed that nothing could change their good mood hermione hadntmentioned once about getting home infact she seemed to have forgotten all about it the great hall was full of smiling faces and gentle morning conversation the trio found seats away from everyone else and started happily on their breakfast after a few minutes the post arrived owls flew in from every direction giving letters to their owners harry was surprised to see that hedwig had brought him a letter he took it from her and read it to himself dear harry i glad to hear you are having fun at school and arentgetting too many detentions i sorry i haventwritten to you sooner but your father and i are very busy at the moment with work as you know i received an owl from your sister yesterday telling me about a certain prank on a certain professor i disappointed in you you really ought to respect him more he is your professor and i know your father has told you stories about him but he isntas awful as your father makes out as you can tell i displeased with your behavior unlike your father who found the incident rather amusing the real reason i am writing to you is to invite you home for christmas i know i told you your father and i would be working but i think you and erin are old enough to take care of yourselves even if we cantbe home the whole time i d also like you to think of what you would like for christmas your father tells me there are some new broomsticks in quality quidditch supplies that he thinks you would like write back soon love mum harry lifted his head to face hermione and ron mum wants me to come home this christmas harry whispered disbelieving he grinned like a five year old and rolled up the letter that great mate ron smiled great i cantbelieve it harry said i going to meet my parents the trio sauntered towards defence against the dark arts each with a smile on their face even though they had had umbridge last year for dada it was still their favorite subject to harry it was special because it was the one lesson he was better than hermione in which was saying something they ambled into the classroom to find the class already seated silently and to their great dislike snape standing at the front so you ve finally decided to bless us with your presence have you snape scowled and was met with three confused faces you re late he elaborated in a stern voice no we re not ron argued the bell hasn t the bell rang load and clear sit down snape scowled and 30 points from gryffindor i dontallow lateness or rudeness they took the only remaining seats right at the front of the class now as i was saying snape said harshly your attempt last lesson was abysmal and i expect some better work this lesson snape paused for a moment and you could have cut the tension with a knife this lesson we will be working on patronus s snape said in a tone of utter loathing i doubt any of you will grasp them but i have been asked by the headmaster to cover them snape them went on to explain what they were and harry just grinned to himself this was one thing harry could do with ease now get up and show me how appalling i know you all are snape ordered the class rose from their chairs and started chanting the spell hesitantly most people managed to get some silver smoke to issue from their wands but not very much and it definitely didntresemble an animal daydreaming are we mr potter snape sneered over harry shoulder or is the work too easy for the likes of you of course you must be some kind of genius as you never usually feel compelled to turn up for lessons let alone work harry just shook his head at snape i ll be seeing your progress at the end of the lesson mr potter snape said simply and swept away at the end of the lesson snape brought in a boggart in the form of a dementor and put it at the front of the class everybody stared at it miss bones would you care to try first snape stated rather than asked susan bones walked slowly forward and said the incantation but only a little silvery smoke emerged from her wand she tried again and again until she was sick and shaking that ll do snape muttered with little concern in his voice i didntexpect any better miss granger care to dazzle us with your excellency you are supposed to be the brightest student at hogwarts though i honestly cantsee how hermione walked forward her body shaking angrily she placed herself in front of the boggart and took a large breath she shouted the incantation and a jet of smoke floated from her wand her patronus wasntas good as harry had seen it before it was a thin dusty outline of an otter and didnteven make the boggart flinch sit down miss granger snape said that was better than i expected from anyone in this class but it was still rather awful hermione took her seat and harry and ron gave her concerned looks i just cantdo it today hermione muttered angrily i just too angry with snape just ignore him harry soothed feel the need to talk in my lesson do you mr potter snape asked i trust you ve mastered this spell then why dontyou come up here and surprise us all harry strolled to the front of the class determined his wand in his hand he stood bang in front of the dementor and raised his wand expecto patronum harry yelled a large silvery galloping stag emerged from harry wand it glided around the boggart until the boggart disappeared the stag then did a victory lap of the class room before harry called it to him harry gave the stag a small bow and the stag nodded his head before disappearing the whole class was in shock wow prongs dean whispered from the second row i never knew you could do that prongs eh snape said with deep dislike class dismissed that was really something harry ron grinned after class yea you really showed snape seamus said he couldntmake one bad comment about it how did you do it dean asked you hardly ever turn up to dada where did you learn that out of a book harry lied looking at his feet why seamus asked you never study i wasntstudying i was harry stuttered i i have a fear of dementors yea they erm really give me the creeps so i learnt that spell incase i ever came across one good idea seamus grinned do you know a spell ron could use to scare off spiders very funny ron muttered rolling his eyes just a minute harry said searching his pockets i ve lost my wand i must have dropped it last lesson i d better go back i ll catch up with you later harry rushed off in the opposite direction until he reached the dada classroom he found his wand under a desk and quickly departed the room before snape found him in there and had an excuse to gave him detention he ran until he reached the end of the dark passage which lead to one of the main busy corridors he would be safe there he was just about to turn the corner when someone caught his eye it was a girl she had long fiery hair and deep amber eyes she had a thin but curvy figure which harry couldnthelp but admire her face was bright and cheerful and her mouth formed a friendly smile harry thought she was beautiful the girl passed him with a group of her friends she had confidence in her stride and a look which suggested that she knew something you didn t she was entrancing and it was as if everything went in slow motion as she walked by harry watched her walk past and admired everything from her long creamy legs to her long brown eye lashes it wasntuntil she rounded the corner that harry realized who she was he followed her and her group of friends and saw them stop outside a charms room he snatched the marauders map quickly out of his pocket and said the magic words he skimmed the map until he found himself he looked just across the map and there it was a dot labeled ginevra weasley chapter 8 predictions harry spent the next few lessons in a daze he was having trouble getting used to the fact that he was attracted to ginny little ginny weasley not that she was so little anymore she was curvier than most girls he knew and a lot prettier of course harry hadnttold ron that nor hermione for that matter harry new found thoughts kept him thinking all through to lunch when his brain finally started to kick in well i have arithmancy said hermione checking her timetable so you two much have divination great ron moaned you didnthave to take divination you know hermione said yea ron answered but me and harry got e on our owls in it apparently examiners are very gullible you still didnthave to take it hermione argued you know it a load of rubbish but if i can get a newt in it who cares ron exclaimed you ought to care what it to you shut up both of you harry bellowed you sound like an old married couple we do not ron and hermione chorused lets talk about me harry said do you reckon trelawney will predict my death in this world only one way to find out ron said steering harry off towards the north tower they emerged in the classroom about 10 minutes later they chose a table to sit at and were soon in deep conversation good day trelawney said in her usual mystical tones i glad to see you are all well as i knew you would be it a shame you wontbe for long as i afraid a nasty batch of flu will cause most of you to fall sick by the end of the month but dontworry it ll be gone by christmas lavender and parvati pulled their scarves up over their faces trying to block out unwanted germs now let us begin trelawney smiled today we will be continuing our work on crystal balls divide into pairs and tell each other what you can see i suggest we all work hard today as i afraid our lesson will be interrupted towards the end and we will have to evacuate the room harry and ron exchanged confused looks before getting a crystal ball and beginning i can see ron began staring into the ball and rubbing his temples i see fog no smoke yea smoke i sure ron harry said i hate to burst your bubble but the whole ball is filled with smoke you try then ron said pushing the ball in front of harry i not in the mood harry yawned the warm fire and darkness of the room was making him drowsy go on ron encouraged i tried harry stared into the smoky ball and before he knew it his mind started to wander he saw images floating across his mind images of ginny first he saw her with molly showing him through the entrance to platform 9 3 4 on his first day of school the next image was of the chamber of secrets ginny almost lifeless body lying on the floor then she was happily flying on a broom in a quidditch match then he saw her giving him a hug like she had last summer the next image was of her dancing dancing with him they waltzed across his mind or was it in his mind he wasntso sure anymore was it even ginny and him they were dancing so fast harry a voice asked huh harry said and started to notice his surroundings still looking in front of him he was surprised to see the image was not in his mind but in the crystal ball harry jumped and lost focus the image was gone what do you want harry asked ron trelawney was right about the disturbance in the class ron explained someone dungbombed the place if you hadntnoticed for the first time harry noticed that the room around him was filled with smelly smoke and dungbombs littered the ground they quickly evacuated and ran outside for some fresh air that better ron smiled as he took in the fresh cool air and you thought i was mad when i predicted smoke i was right there was tones of smoke everywhere in there i just made my first prediction wait until i tell hermione harry laughed half heartedly hey chorused two friendly voices hey moony wormtail ron grinned guess what i made a prediction in divination oh my goodness seamus mocked in a voice strangely like trelawney s you have the markings of a true seer funny ron moaned wait a minute what are you two doing out here oh we were the ones who dungbombed your class seamus explained you can thank us later that was you ron grinned lav and pav are going kill you when they find out they were midway through predicting themselves getting the flu when the dungbombs appeared what the matter with you prongsie dean asked just divination harry muttered and was given three bemused faces in return lets just say you werentthe only one to have a prediction ron ohhhhhh dean and seamus said looking strangely like lavender and parvati it doesntmatter harry mumbled now we d better head back to class history of magic now isntit the others muttered a reply and the marauders headed up to the castle they met hermione outside the classroom and started discussing dung bombing divination harry let his mind wander he d never predicted anything in divination before and he couldntquite get his head round it harry thoughts were interrupted when he heard two hushed voices i dontknow what happened do you think they ve broken up it was lavender and parvati no parvati said scrunching up her nose they re still talking to each other have you asked her about it lavender asked no parvati said they re just acting so normal maybe it just a mid relationship break or something that what hannah thinks it is lavender gossiped but most people seem to think they re just going through a rough patch harry rolled his eyes at the girls gossiping he wished they d be quiet and let him have some thinking time to himself just then the teacher called for them to enter harry cleared his mind before following his class inside the classroom was different to how harry remembered in the old world the classroom was dusty and unwelcoming but this room was formal and clean it looked like a room you could do lots of work in harry chose a seat between hermione and ron and took his book out before taking a look at his teacher he looked to be in about his sixties by appearance yet the way he wrote vigorously showed that he still had it left in him he looked like quite a respectable and powerful person yet there was something harry disliked about him he wasntsure if it was his graying hair or his pointed nose he just couldntplace it harry also knew recognized him from somewhere harry looked to the suit case which was laid on the desk to the right of the new teacher and dropped his ink pot in shock across the top of the suit case printed in clear silver letters were the words tom m riddle chapter 9 hospital wing hermione quickly cleared up harry spilt ink and gave him a meaningful look harry turned to see ron with his hands over his mouth in shock and harry gave him a nudge good afternoon class riddle smiled good afternoon they repeated back like they were in primary school harry watched tom rise from his chair and walk around his table to the front of the class for today lesson we are going to continue our discussion on witch hunting riddle announced what happened what the witches did and most importantly why riddle left an effective pause and smiled to his intrigued class harry would have thought riddle was a good teacher but all he could think was that the man before him was a murderer now which famous witch let herself get burnt 47 times miss granger riddle quizzed wendelin the weird hermione stated without her usual confidence right that 10 points to gryffindor neville riddle grinned what is the charm used to stop you from getting burnt the flame freezing charm neville guessed correct riddle announced 10 points to hufflepuff now get into groups and continue your discussions make them good too as your homework is to write up what you ve discussed harry watched riddle smile as he swept back behind his table it wasnta menacing smirk or an evil grin it was a happy carefree smile he looked as if he was about to open his mouth and laugh riddle met harry eyes are you ok mr potter riddle asked looking concerned yes i i just feeling a little bit sick harry lied looking at his feet would you like some chocolate riddle asked with a small smile it always helps no harry said quickly no i d rather get some fresh air that what i need very well riddle said if you re sure go get some fresh air and if you still feel sick then go to the hospital wing thank you harry mumbled as he stuffed his book back in his bag then left the room he ran as fast as he could to the entrance hall then ran outside he lent over holding his stomach and breathing fast he couldnttake it in how could someone like that be a murderer in one world and a teacher in another i wish voldemort never went bad the words hung in harry mind harry rushed inside worried by his own thoughts he made his way slowly to the hospital wing and pushed the door open inside harry could see madame pomfrey was tending to someone who was hidden from his view by the bed curtain harry walked inside and found that the hidden person was ginny hi harry jumped in surprise hi ginny replied coolly with a smile i think that ok miss weasley madame pomfrey told ginny in a motherly manor just rest it for a minute then you may return to your lesson and next time do be more careful wontyou i will ginny smiled honestly good madame pomfrey smiled fondly now what can i do for you mr potter i feel sick harry muttered lamely his hand scratching behind his head ginny giggled sick madame pomfrey questioned well you look quite fine to me but i not harry moaned dramatically playing up to ginny my stomach hurts maybe it was something i ate at lunch what did you eat at lunch madame pomfrey asked with a raised eyebrow i had three cheese sandwiches two ham sandwiches 6 plates of chips 4 cream cakes 2 glasses of pumpkin juice and a current bun harry said conversationally dontyou think that a lot madame pomfrey asked sternly i a growing boy harry exclaimed and ginny fell into fits of giggles well if you re not careful madame pomfrey warned you ll start growing outwards instead of upwards i know harry said rubbing his tummy affectionately i ll be more careful of what i eat next time very well madame pomfrey sighed as she marched off take a seat harry jumped sideways onto the bed next to ginny s landing on his side resting his head on his left hand hey harry charmed he felt incredibly confident with ginny she wasntlike other girls in the new world she was genuine harry wasntsure how he could tell but he knew she was hey she grinned in reply what re you here for harry asked whilst poking the bed sheets oh i was in care of magical creatures ginny explained and we re revising nifflers well this one niffler thought it would be funny to steal my watch i chased it everywhere then tripped up a rock and messed up me knee harry took a look at her bandaged knee but soon regretted it he couldnthelp but look from her knee to her legs he had never noticed in the other world how long they were yea nasty harry muttered clearing his throat harry wasntsure if she had noticed him looking at her legs because she went red in the face yet didntmove harry was sure ginny skirt in this world was twice as short as in the old world infact harry decided it looked more like a belt so why are you here ginny asked forcing harry to meet her large amber eyes just couldntbe bothered to do work really harry lied shrugging his shoulders i just not in the mood i blame trelawney i had divination last lesson and the room is so hot it makes me drowsy fair enough ginny said satisfied with her answer did you see anything today in divination have a premonition no harry said sharply it a load of rubbish you know it isn t ginny said sweetly wrapping a lock of hair around her finger your sister predicts stuff all the time and it comes true trelawney thinks she might be a seer maybe harry smiled picturing erin with a crystal ball there was an awkward silence and ginny rose from her bed well i d better head back she said plainly i need to find that niffler and get my watch back harry laughed would you like me to walk you back he asked hopefully no thank you ginny replied cheerfully i ok i ll see you around and with that she was gone harry fell back onto his bed buried his face and fell into a dreamless sleep
