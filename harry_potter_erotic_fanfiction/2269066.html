 disclaimer i dontown anything you recognize it belongs to jkr chapter 1 bad choices i happy well just about as happy as a girl could get in my situation my mum is really nice but my dad hasntalways been well too fatherly nothing too big but i hate him all the same and i stay away from him as much as possible when i look back i feel that my life could have been a lot better if he would have just gone away turns out i was the one that would leave it started with the first letter i had ever received in my life muggle borns stories start like this all the time of course at the time i had no idea what a muggle born even was the letter you cantguess what the letter was my hogwarts letter i can still remember to this day how confused and hope filled i felt when i read that letter after getting the mail for the family it was probably a joke but i couldnthelp but wonder if it was real the small hope that came from that letter was a feeling i would never forget ever since the first time i was hit by my father i ve been doing weird things i remember the day he had been yelling at me for some reason or another and raised his arm to hit me or not i was about to take the blow when his hand just stopped i remember being scared to death and thinking he was going to take mercy but when i looked up i realized his hand stopping in place he looked like he was struggling to move his arm and couldn t i took the opportunity to run to the park the farthest away place i could think of at that age i know now it was the first sparks of magic in me small questionable things happened to me after that too almost breaking a vase and having it stop tipping back to the letter my dad thought it was crazy and told me it was some prank my mum on the other hand didntthink it would hurt to write back and it didnthurt at all in fact it helped because someone came to out house to prove it to us hagrid which i came to know better later arrived at our house by request of dumbledore to explain and prove it to us a bit even though he wasntsuppose to can you imagine a half giant banging on your door at 4 00 pm i know i can because i experienced it my dad suddenly wasntso brave as he walked into the backyard ran more like when hagrid entered out house actually i was the one who let him in how was i supposed to know it would make me scream and run to the back of the room well eventually he got us to trust him i was the first to trust him i guess i never got the donttalk to strangers talk and he fascinated me so after working things out and ignoring my dad my story starts here at hogwarts at the beginning of my first year so there i sat all alone just like at my old school in one of the train compartments to a train called the hogwarts express i looked around the compartment a bit before figuring i should change into the spiffy robes i had gotten in diagon alley awesome place that is i lie there in my robes at the beginning of our train ride waiting to arrive at hogwarts and start my new life but i got company before we arrived some girl named bianca callaway she opened the compartment door after knocking not allowing me to answer could i sit here she sat down and examined me before waiting for me to answer yes i said confused was it custom for witches to not wait for an answer are you a pure blood she asked with a raised eyebrow uh you dontneed to answer i can tell you re a pure blood arentyou she smiled what house do you think you ll go to um i already know slytherin right i will too the best house there is my whole family has been for generations oh i cantwait to arrive and yes i could do with some candy she said as she got up and bought some candy from the cart i decided to buy exactly what she bought figuring it would have to be ok if she liked it so we sat there eating through things i had never heard of of course i didnttell her that to embarrass my self she tilted her head as i jumped when the chocolate frog leaped out of my hands and out of the compartment smart she said sarcastically uhhhhh not very talkative are you what your name anyways autumn vilcent i replied figuring she should know my last name just incase she decided she didntwant to my friend and call me by my surname bianca callaway she said pausing and mocking me i nodded and went back to the best set of jellybeans i had ever had in my life until i got one that tasted like sardine bleh i exclaimed wanting to spit it out but having nowhere to spit it and wanting to be civilized i swallowed it fast what flavour she asked i think it was sardine i said trying to get the taste out with a chocolate frog making sure it didntjump off this time you haventgotten the worst yet then i ve had a puke flavoured one once horrid couldntget the taste out for hours she said twisting her face as she remembered the taste at this i decided to stop eating all these candies i admit it i was scared of them now that when she told me we still had a while to go till we got there she was a little off because the train stopped right when she said that so it wasnt soon my heart started pounding in my chest this was it i walked out of the train with my stuff and headed towards hagrid the only familiar face there other than bianca and we clamored into boats and headed off towards the most beautiful castle and only castle i had ever seen in my life it gleamed in the moonlight i was so amazed that i didntsee everyone put their hoods up and i didntfeel the heavy rain that was beginning to fall out of the sky i just gawked forward at hogwarts getting soaking wet someone poked me from behind it was a boy with sandy brown hair looking just as nervous as her you might want to put your hood on he said in a shy but kind manner huh i looked around then snapped back to my senses oh i said bashfully realizing how dumb i must have looked thanks we all got off the boats and i looked around for bianca who i had lost in the crowd after we got off the boats i didntfind her so i just walked with the rest of the first years up to the castle entrance a very stern looking woman met us inside the door as we were all taking off out hoods me revealing very damp long black hair although i had always thought i looked better when my hair was wet than dry but still i shifted uncomfortably looking around at my fellow classmates they all looked just as nervous as i did the lady who introduced herself as professor mcgonagall told us something about 4 houses but the only one i could pick out was slytherin as i had heard bianca talk about it i decided i wanted to be in slytherin as it was probably my only chance to having a friend in the same house she then told us to stand together in a group waiting for the sorting now i was really lost was i the only one who had no idea what was going on was i supposed to take some sort of test i remember thinking i going to fail and then be kicked out for sure i didntknow we were supposed to study for anything i heard the first name be called black sirius i couldnthelp but think what kind of parent would name their kid serious poor kid but he looked pretty confident to me he had black hair that was comparably long for a boy and he was pretty tall too he strutted to the stool that was placed in front of the whole school we had to take a test in front of the whole bloody school great the serious kid had a hat put on his head a hat and the hat yelled yelled gryffindor the boy jumped off the seat and to a table to the far right of where he was sitting then mcgonagall cleared her throat and called callaway bianca there she was bianca walked up with her shoulder length blonde hair bouncing to sit on the stool the ragged hat was placed on her head and it yelled slytherin what if i dontmake slytherin i thought about it and figured the kids went up alphabetically by last name which calmed me down a bit as i was probably going last i completely zoned everybody out until i realized there was only one person besides me left to be sorted i gave him a friendly nod and he was called up and put into hufflepuff i didntcatch his name because i was too busy standing all alone waiting for my name to be called what if my name isntcalled maybe she will just put down the list and ignore me mcgonagall paused that it vilcent autumn i sighed relieved i walked up to the stool concentrating all my energy on not tripping in front of the whole school the whole bloody school i repeated in my head i sat on the stool feeling stupid and waited until the hat was placed on my head then i heard voices inside my head i ve gone mad so where to put you hmmm well you are very honest maybe hufflepuff no but gryffindor sounds good very brave brave yes that what i said brave yes gryffindor sounds good then he stopped to shout of his answer no what i d like to be in slytherin or else i ll have no friends i only know someone in slytherin are you sure you arenta very built slytherin although you may just posses qualities of a slytherin but i ve never put a muggle born in slytherin hmmm if you re sure yes i sure i thought desperately ok ok if you really think yes slytherin yes it true i changed ch 1 i hated the old version and i thought it was time for a change plusi was bored and had a writers block moonlightwitch ya i donthave aim anymore i got rid of it cause it was slowing my comp down but i do have yahoo now xangelxgirlx yey i feel happy and i shooting for 100 000 words at least maybe the story will never end or go on till i like 96 years old who knows but i not stopping disclaimer familiar stuffs not mine stuff that is mine is mine not making money off this stuff just for fun short and simple chapter 10 awkward shocks it was a week from the end of summer and the beginning of our third year i couldnthave been happier i was now walking side by side with three friends in diagon alley browsing for random stuff to buy on top of school supplies zonko anyone sirius grinned james and remus both yelled yeah and they bolted towards the store well um bye meet you at oh never mind i said as they disappeared into the store they d better not get anything too stupid i doubted they wouldnt so i decided to go christmas shopping never too late to go christmas shopping by the end i had a present for no one oh well it hard to shop for guys that you know little about at least i got all my school supplies and it had all only taken two hours seeing as i was finished i walked back to zonko s who knows maybe they re still in there and they were but they were coming out you spent two hours in a joke shop they all nodded what did you get confidential james muttered they seemed to all be distracted with what was hidden in the beautifully coloured zonko shopping bags riiiight they all nodded again you guys are dumber than a troll with its tiny brain gouged out i waited they nodded and i laughed we started walking down the street towards who knows what they finally stopped drooling over their supplies and stopped all at once i stopped with them where are we going remus asked i dunno james replied ooo ooo let go to he looked around get butterbeer they all grinned and i raised my eyebrow are you allowed to have beer at this age they looked like they were holding back guffaws well that all depends how old are you sirius asked well i just turned 13 just remus asked well not just my birthday was in may may what sirius asked may 15th they all though for a moment then sirius said ha we re all older than you you arentold enough we re all about to turn 14 and you have to be 13 and a half i scrunched my nose at him well when your guy birthday september 21st sirius said october 16th james added october 30th remus finished off for them your birthday sure are close to each other s they shrugged so how bout peter um december 13th james said after thinking for a second yeah i think that right ok so then butterbeer they all shouted finishing my sentence incorrectly they all bolted towards a small pub what is it with you guys and sprinting places after a nice butterbeer the liars it non alcoholic we all went back to james home and lounged looking at our new supplies i didnteven bother with looking at the pranks the marauder boys were planning with their new joke products eventually i got up and sat on a chair and shifted and shifted i was bored like hec i grabbed a pillow and threw it at them hitting james in the back of the head he didnteven turn around in fact none of them did i gave an exasperated sigh and got up headed for upstairs i hadntread a good textbook in a while and i needed to get a head start on 3rd year i lay there already halfway though a book i a fast reader well it took a few hours but whatever i laughed rita leopold killed a troll by accidentally shooting a spell in the wrong direction making a tree uproot and hit the troll on the head i find that funny it is funny right right uh huh what so funny i gave a suspicious glare at the three marauders at my door they just got prank products they d be testing it nothing i said still glaring what sirius asked eyeing my glare oh nothing i said smiling losing the glare soooo james said and came over and sat on the bed i sat up stiff sirius and remus came over and sat also bye i said not waiting to find out i got up and started for the door wait why are you leaving sirius asked i turned and put my hands on my hips well let see you guys just bought some zonko products and haventtested it out yet i think that a good enough reason to run dontyou think none of them said anything until sirius blinked stupidly and muttered damn she smart why thank you good bye i said and with that i walked out the door splat yes i know i should have seen it coming a barf y looking substance was all over my head now and when i finally was able to wipe my eyes off and look up i couldntsee anything no bucket stupid zonko s no even better stupid boys i cleaned myself off and i ran back into the room they seemed to be frantically searching for something when i walked in they all froze i was glaring at them for two reasons now what are you guys doing searching for panties james managed a giggle and boy did i shoot him a deathly glare but remus and sirius were silent no just bye remus said as they all dashed off i took my wand and flew after them i paused when i entered a silent kitchen i held my wand up thinking of different spells that would work about now you guys are sooooo dead hmm well i know how i walked over to the fireplace and took down the floo powder bag i grabbed a bit and stepped into the fireplace i held my nose and yelled diagon alley next thing i knew i was shopping who would have known i decided to get a present for all the marauders for being so dare i even think it kind i settled for a magical camera for remus a mini quidditch pitch for james and a hovering mini broom on a platform for sirius i was happy who needs peter d so i decided after a few hours to go back i walked up to my room and there i magically wrapped the presents satisfied i hid them and lay down on my back what were they looking for then i remembered it that cloak i looked under the mattress it was still there what was so important about this stupid cloak i draped it around myself and twirled i looked down to see the color and gasped it whoa it an invisibility cloak ha another marauder secret uncovered now i know how they pull all those pranks at night without getting caught oh crap i had just then remembered the hogsmead permission form we were suppose to get signed i ran downstairs and looked around for the boys leaving the cloak under my mattress then i saw remus chasing james closely followed by sirius they all stopped oh we thought you had died sirius said bluntly that nice of you i said sarcastically sirius shrugged right well i leaving if i dontcome back to school assume my dad murdered me they all nodded wait what remus asked finally getting it did one of us make you mad james asked murder i rolled my eyes no you guys didntget me mad but i need to get home to get the hogsmead form signed and yes sirius murder i not exactly supposed to be here remember oh yeah sirius thought well you could just go back for a day and then come back right wrong first off if i live my dad will have me locked in chains and good luck to me getting to hogwarts anyways then why leave remus questioned i d like to go to hogsmead i guess it sounded sort of stupid but i needed a break from marauders anyways ooooooook james raised his eyebrows looking at me like i was crazy i nodded and turned to go pack i was all packed with the invisibility cloak included then i grabbed the presents and went and set it on the bed of each separate boy i sighed i really didntwant to leave this place oh well i walked downstairs and sighed again the three marauders met me at the foot of the stairs looking oddly gloom i smiled weakly hey i figured out what you should name your owl sirius grinned what retiues retiues what the hec does that mean it is r e for remus t for peter i u for muah and e s for james why does peter only get one letter because he not here and he cantyell at me for it i grinned it perfect a n you pronounce retiues ret e ous you didnthappen to find a blue silver cloak anywhere did you james asked nervously you mean an invisibility cloak nope all of their eyes went wide where is it sirius asked i have a small mischievous smile and started towards the door quickly oho not so fast sirius ran after me and grabbed my around the waist he pulled me so i fell on the floor and started tickling me i ll let you know i very ticklish so you can imagine how hard i was laughing o ok ok but he didntstop i think he enjoyed causing me pain well i guess it isntreally pain but whatever sirius i managed to giggle he stopped for a few seconds letting my catch my breath i realized the other two marauders were searching my bags hey i got cut off because sirius started tickling me again n n no i said laughing i heard found it sirius stopped tickling me to say k go hide it upstairs when they left he turned back to me still on the floor with the post tickle giggles thought you could steal the cloak you know wayyyy too much now i afraid i ll have to perform surgery this may hurt a little i raised and eyebrow but he just started tickling me again this time harder than before i tried to flip over but my abdomen hurt too much and i as laughing much too hard he finally stopped and i took deep breaths what was that for i said giggling he smiled then he slowly stopped smiling i did too i was worried a bit to tell you the truth then he did the unthinkable he leaned down and kissed me softly when we parted we both turned beet red that was so cheesy and yet so cute we both heard the other two boys stomp through the halls so we both stood up and brushed ourselves off james was the first to notice why are you two so red i turned a darker red we um it just a bit warm down here isntit sirius asked me i nodded james raised an eyebrow right well you should get going huh ya i should then i realized i wasntgoing through the front door so i wheeled my stuff to the fireplace i stood in front of the fireplace and turned right well bye i guess could i go with you sirius asked we all gawked at him mouths wide why both remus and james asked just so she doesntdie bye right bye donttake forever shagging james smirked james both sirius and i yelled and then blushed a bit but before he could notice we had turned and flooed out yey for fluff heh i dunno i thought

could talk to her for the first time in weeks thanks again chapter 11 of redheaded girls right well bye i guess could i go with you sirius asked we all gawked at him mouths wide why both remus and james asked just so she doesntdie bye right bye donttake forever shagging james smirked james both sirius and i yelled and then blushed a bit but before he could notice we had turned and flooed out i ran up to my room in the potter mansion slammed the door and flopped on the bed my face in the pillow i should have never gone back it was a joke to think i would get the permission slip signed it was a bigger joke to think i wouldntbe yelled at at least i didntget beaten i think he was afraid sirius would tell someone about it or something i sat up looking out the window while clutching the pillow and having my tear dampened chin rest on my knee still crying i reached for my wand and tried shakily to lock the door because i knew sirius was going to come up eventually because he saw the whole thing after failing a few times to perform the lock charm i angrily threw my wand at the door luckily it didntsnap in two sirius knocked and opened the door after i didntanswer he walked over to me and i mumbled something about him going away please dontsay anything i said still shaky ok then he just looked at me compassionately what i asked feeling uncomfortable under his gaze you look like crap thanks i mumbled then i looked at him he was actually looking kind of worried so i giggled into my pillow what i ve never seen you look so serious i always sirius he smiled i rolled my eyes i ll give you your wand back if you promise not to curse me i looked over at him i guess he had picked up my wand on his way in not making any promises i stuck my tongue out at him fine no wand hey i was joking he stood up and strutted out the door uhg sirius i hate you i said jokingly and stood up running after him i ran back downstairs this time with my trunk sirius did you get the map james yelled from up the stairs ya i walked up to him with a smug expression what he asked map eh nice you guys are so full of random secrets who said anything about a map i rolled my eyes and went to do a last check before we left for king cross ready to go guys almost i put my hair in a high ponytail and ran downstairs and grabbed my trunk to drag it out the door there was a honk and we all scrambled out the door to meet mr and mrs potter who was taking us to king cross station i sighed the marauders were all sprinting towards the last compartment i figured they were used to having just four people in the compartment so i followed them in hope of finding a compartment near them come on james yelled back at me i blinked ooookkk i raised an eyebrow was there enough room oh well i ran after them the door clicked behind us one two three where was the fourth marauder where was peter where peter i asked erm he owled us and told us he needed to talk to someone about something or another anyhow how shall we entertain ourselves this beautiful day they all shrugged and i grinned let play truth or dare their blank expressions told me they had no idea what i was talking about never mind no what is it erm it this game that um ok this is how it goes one person asks truth or dare and the other person has to choose one if they pick truth they get one question asked that they have to answer truthfully if they pick dare they have to do something that the other person says to and after that they get to ask truth or dare and i conveniently forgot to mention that it was mostly a girl game sure that sounds life ruining let give it a shot sirius exclaimed happily i chuckled boys can be so dumb sometimes although so can girls so then who goes first james asked i ll go first because i know how to play i said sure ok james truth or dare um truth wimp sirius muttered grinning james sneered ok this was easy what map are you guys working on and what if i dontanswer truthfully what could be so secret that you canttell someone who already knows you guys have done like four illegal things four whatever fine it just a map of the school were working on that shows where people are that not illegal is it dontthink so then it ok right you still canttell another rule in truth or dare what is told here stays here got it yeah they all muttered right james your turn sirius truth or dare dare course i snickered hm i dare you to kiss fall girl over here no both of us yelled in unison hey i didntmake up the rules i saw a shine in sirius eye he turned to me took my hand and kissed it there you didntsay where sirius looked very satisfied with himself fall girl i asked still lingering on that comment well like autumn fall get it i laughed i like it he smiled ha now we all have stupid nicknames hey i like prongs james protested i didntsay i didntlike it i just said it was stupid i grinned ya but hey i stuck my tongue at him and then smiled sirius your turn k fall girl he chuckled at his own joke truth or dare truth do you think i unbearably hot and irresistible he grinned smugly i laughed yes a loud chorus of ooooooooooooooooo could be heard through the train then we all started laughing sidesplitting laugher more like soon we were all either on the floor laughing or sprawled out on a seat cracking up when we all finally calmed down james asked it wasnt that funny was it no not really just good timing i giggled so were you serious sirius asked seriously a n sorry couldnthelp it no that you i laughed sirius sneered no really you d like to think so wouldntyou yes oooooooooooooooooooo we all started laughing again but not as long this time now i was sitting on the floor sirius was sprawled where i used to be sitting and remus and james were sprawled on different ends of the seat we all calmed down anything off the trolley dears the marauders jumped up excitedly and went for the candy on the way james stepped on me i slapped him lazily and then used his shirt to get up bertie bott beans are fun i ate the whole pack minus a few half eaten nasty flavours the marauders were now practically bouncing off the walls of the compartment no more candy for them i put my feet up on my previous seat and leaned against where james was sitting hey fall could you stop leaning on my legs please i looked up grunted and rolled over so i fell on the floor completely tired sirius asked i spent all last night reading our textbooks and i couldntfinish them pity james said mockingly i stuck my tongue at him i grabbed my wand flicked it i now had my school uniform on robes and all woah how d you do that remus asked well there are advantages to reading textbooks i said glaring at james uh huh james said i smiled these guys were so weird then i grinned remembering how many friends i had in first year what up with you sirius asked eyeing my grin nothing sirius rolled his eyes i slowly turned around so my head was leaning against where i use to be sitting and soon all of their words turned into a foreign language and i dozed off you think we should wake her up naw let let her stay on the train fine i ll wake her up hey fall girl i felt myself being shaken awake uh we re there where i opened my eyes to find remus standing over me and me lying on the floor where i had fallen asleep your school ya i know i awake now thanks no problem i stood up and brushed my self off and quickly fixed my hair and followed the rest of the students out of the train and to the carriages right bye then i said solemnly to the griffindor boys as we split up to go to out different common rooms the slytherin common room was and would always be a constant reminder of that dreaded decision i made on the first say of school i had the chance to be in griffindor i was this close holds up two fingers showing a small amount but this year i was hoping on spending as little time as possible inside my stupid common room and more time outside and in the library anywhere where different houses could mingle a n it 11 24 pm and the word mingle sounds so funny right now mingle mingle mingle wingle ok i done since when do you read about remodeling since i realized my common room was too dark to handle i looked up from my book and saw sirius ah and what are you going to do about it i going to build a window there was a pause but isntthe slytherin common room underground i put my book down and looked at him questioningly as if to ask how the hec he knew about where the slytherin common room was map the marauders map actually creative name thanks i thought so too i rolled my eyes yes the common room is underground i trying to build an artificial window riiiight good luck with that i ll just be over there having a life sirius said slowly backing away as if i were made of germs i grabbed a book i had already read and chucked it at him hitting him square in the head ow he muttered rubbing the back of his head and reaching down to pick up the book find your inner remodeling skills he said reading the title out loud oh shut up i sneered playfully make me i chucked a heavier book at him this time hitting him in the shoulder violent little girl arentwe i held back another book threatening to throw it at him if he didntshut up ok ok i going already sheesh he turned only to have the book thrown at the back of his head when he wheeled around i was pretending to be deep into my researching he glared at me and turned back around i giggled and hid my face with my book i heard him mutter something obviously some rude name for me and i said hey could i have my books back i put the book down grinning he wheeled back around and then gave a fake grin sure he reached down grabbed all three books and threw them one by one at me of course i tried to catch them but didntdo that well i stuck my tongue at him and went back to reading as sirius finally walked over to the rest of the marauders a while later i looked up to make sure the marauders werentplanning some prank against me what i found definitely wasnta prank there was a redheaded girl sitting by them talking to them i tilted my head oh i remember her she that evans girl i thought remembering the teacher calling out her name during potions was she flirting with them oh well it none of my business i went back to researching letting the matter go ignoring the small knot

during potions was she flirting with them oh well it none of my business i went back to researching letting the matter go ignoring the small knot forming in my stomach oooooooooo it y new separator its mad eye moody do you see it oo i worked on a table near the back of the library thinking to myself is it safe to look around these shelves lately evans had been spending a whole lot of time with the marauders and it didntexactly look like the marauders meant to ignore me it seems more like they couldntfind me maybe because i d been hiding from them see i didntreally want to take the chances i didntwant to see if the marauders would accept me back maybe it was all just a game maybe every year they picked up a girl and pretended to be their friend until they got bored of them was i boring them what if i a stupid my thoughts got cut off with a slam i jumped and fell out of my seat pathetic i know i looked up expecting to see sirius with his stupid grin but instead it was callaway hello mudblood she said casually what do you want i mumbled trying to act confident it wasntworking she sat across from me well i really shouldntbe talking to you but i was wondering why you were placed into slytherin during the sorting it was a mistake i said coldly waiting for her to take the hint and leave she didn t right just to let you know us slytherins dontall approve of muggles and their mudblood children i sneered why are you talking about this to me now you know i did get sorted a few years ago yes i know but things have come up she paused looking like she was thinking of how to put it like what well i got a letter and it was directed um i was told to give this to a mudblood would you quit that i said knowing that the term mudblood was nothing nice quit what calling me that what mudblood well that what you are isntit mudblood whatever i stopped so she wouldntthink i cared right as i was saying i was suppose to give this to someone like you she corrected and so here she handed me a letter then stood up quickly and left as if she didntwant to see me read it i sighed as she left and pocketed the letter suddenly forgetting about what i was reading i still hadntfigured out how to create a fake window in our common room and stood up walking towards the great hall it was dinner time i was rather disappointed that none of the marauders had done anything about me still sitting alone in my 3rd year of course evans could sit by them she was a bloody griffindor what am i thinking i d kill to be a griffindor i ate my food quickly for some reason i didntfeel like moping over my food i felt like eating so i could just sit at the table waiting for who knows what when i was finished i sat and waited not realizing i was fingering the letter in my robe pocket i pulled it out there was nothing on the front but there was something odd about this particular letter i thought about it for a while fiddling with the corners of the letter it looks like a muggle letter i realized

different tables ya well i dontthink i cut sirius off no no she right i really probably shouldntbe here sorry i said a bit colder than i intended i got up abruptly and left the great hall leaving the marauders speechless for a moment autumn i ignored the calls from whom i thought to be sirius and kept walking fast through the corridors after feeling followed long enough i finally swiveled around saying what but found no one there i blinked a few times stupidly and then slowly turned back around maybe i was just very paranoid then again i gave the faintest of a smile then started walking in a corridor that led away from the library where i was headed at the start i walked for what seemed like an hour hoping my gut feeling was right until i had circled around the school at least 5 times and headed for the entrance i walked out the doors and straight to the bench my bench that is and sat i scratched the back of my neck and said you can come out now nothing happened i felt really stupid now aw come on i serious i said a little less confidently i nooo i sirius sirius appeared right next to me i jumped i hadntexpected someone to appear right next to me do you carry around that cloak all the time one of us always carries it just in case uh huh was all i said before i stopped talking beautiful weather huh it the middle of fall well it depends on what you consider beautiful doesntit i looked at him questionably and forgot about what he said i didntknow what he really meant at the time but i sure do now so why d you stomp off like that i had homework it saturday there nothing wrong with doing homework on a saturday yes there is there a million things wrong with doing homework before you have to no there isn t i cut in yes there is nope yes no there isn t we both went dead silent i said it a bit harsher than i actually meant it i stuttered to say something but he crossed his arms and said sternly ok there isn t so why arentyou in the library or your slytherin common room making sure to point out the word slytherin because i felt that someone was following me nice guess ya it was wasntit we re not getting anywhere there nowhere to get i not married to you hec i not even in the same house as you you re right i opened my mouth to argue with him but was shocked oh well um i said in my loss for words just then i heard a pounding of feet coming from the entrance it was james looking angry and flustered once he reached us he glanced at sirius who stood up then immediately yelled what the hell is this i was taken aback what did i do huh dont huh me you dropped this he said flinging a letter into my hands i fumbled for it and finally got a grasp on it i flipped it around it the i already know what it is i took the liberty of reading it that that cantbe legal james blinked what do you care about legal now he was really pissing me off what the hell are you talking about i haventeven opened it well then by all means open it i glared at him and then flipped the letter out of its envelope i opened the muggle paper and read it quickly ms vilcent a dear friend of yours suggested that you might be interested in joining our group as i argued that you are a mudblood they insisted you may be of some help answer as soon as possible patience is not a quality i posses the dark lord i gaped at the letter this cantbe real he wouldntbe so straight forward i sirius snatched it from me and read it after reading it he looked up at me with an expression with a million mixed feelings sorrow anger worry and many many more what sirius stumbled well we all know now why you arenta griffindor huh i was completely lost for words i mean what was i suppose to say some girl from my house came up to me and handed me the letter well yes i suppose i could but they wouldntbelieve it damnit vilcent you re a really good actor i felt my eyes start to water this was way too soap operaish for me to comprehend but shut up sirius said i had never heard anyone not even my dad say something so cold he handed me the letter there was a long silence where my eyes were welling up with tears as much as i was trying to hold it back then i just stood up and swiftly walked towards the entrance and then straight to the library once finally at the back of the library at my little table i sunk low into the chair covering my face and started crying pitiful really i could have just told them the truth but it felt like they wouldntbelieve it if i told it to them anyways i spent the rest of my saturday in the back of the library sobbing oooooooooooooooooooo i sat in one of the only unused classrooms that had a fireplace after lighting it i slowly ripped the corner of the letter off and crumpled it up and threw it into the fire watching the small ashes left of the letter float up and flutter back down i kept ripping up the letter into tiny pieces and burning them until the bottom left corner was all i had left when i had finally tore that piece into even smaller pieces and sprinkled them unto the fire i just sat there and thought the letter couldnthave been real callaway probably made the letter up and gave it to me to scare me into leaving slytherin or something like i wouldntgive anything anyways to be in a different house or maybe she knew one of the marauders would find it or maybe she made it so james found it it very possible just to make me miserable and back to having no friends but what if it is real then would i be in danger what if i dontreply i spend the remainder of sunday thinking to myself about all the possibilities by night i had decided it was a fake letter and that i wasntgoing to write back although it didntstop me from worrying ooooooooooooo when i woke up with bags under my eyes the next morning i wasntreally looking forward to that day at all seeing as it was a monday we had classes today and i would have to face the marauders and their fellow griffindors i had hoped that i may get a chance to talk to them if i ever built up my courage that is what i didntexpect happened in potions that day nothing absolutely nothing that what shocked me i mean i had expected them to at the least glare at me or throw a wad of something at me but they were dead silent apparently paying attention to the teacher so if that how they were going to play it so was i i was tiredly is that a word staring at the teacher and pretending to take notes i probably already knew the information anyways and that the last step we will experiment next class you are dismissed i just barely heard these last words as i gathered my stuff and got up i glanced at sirius and the crew before leaving they werenteven looking at me i was now mentally begging for them to hex me or something giving me the cold shoulder was just well cold in my next few classes i thought of how to get them to believe me to believe that i not some death eater slytherin i was completely zoned out in my thoughts when i heard miss vilcent miss vilcent i snapped out of it y yes would you say that you agree um yes so you agree that all muggle borns will fail in life i blushed sorry i wasntlistening detention i blinked detention no no no no no dangit the rest of the period i was listening it wasntabout muggle borns at all oooooooooo i bolted through the halls ripped around the corner and dodged students i was late for class big time i lost track of time in the library and the most predictable thing in the world happened smack luckily everything was tightly in my book bag so papers didntgo flying everywhere like they do on tv i rubbed a soon to be lump bruise on my head and stood up falling back down dizzily ow sorr he stopped through a blur i could see sirius sitting attempting to get up i waited still with my hand on my forehead until i decided to say sorry formally and then stood up and hurried to my next class that i was late for he never even said sorry well not completely by the end of the day my forehead had a little bruise that was slowly forming i wondered if there was some potion to get rid of bruises or cover up yup that works fine right after breakfast about a week later i decided to take a walk why am i telling you this

later i decided to take a walk why am i telling you this suddenly well it was a very eventful walk what kind of events you ask i sure you d like to know wouldntyou i walked around the lake swinging my arms like a little girl i could walk around the whole lake if i wanted as it was saturday morning and i had nothing better to do after walking for a while i decided to stop and sit on a dry rock i stared out at the lake it looked pretty dull this morning dreary dull mind numbing boring hey vilcent i twitched and didntturn around you going to answer me mudblood crap not if i can help it did you read our letter i didntanswer again did potter read the letter your letter well you didnthonestly think someone like the dark lord would actually take the time to talk to someone like you did you did you we didntlike the idea that slytherins and griffindors were mingling no matter what the circumstances were so we decided to make that letter and have one of the marauders read it you i cut myself off thinking i was right i sighed but honestly i didntthink it would work i stood up and turned around callaway and two boys and another girl i didntrecognize by name were all smiling congratulations i muttered and headed back in the direction of the castle hey hey hey hey the boy said quickly where are you going back to the castle why in such a hurry i turned back around abruptly because there are too many of you against one of me that why i crossed my arms it not like we re going to hurt you callaway said not unless you want us to the boy smirked i kept walking not answering him you cantpossibly be scared of us can you the boy said i turned around with a determined expression no i glared at him really did you ever once think that we re a ways away from the school and if anything happened to you no one would know for a loooong time i glared at him trying to hide the fact that his trying to scare me was working maybe uh huh he whipped out his wand come on you donthave to resort to that i said getting a little more scared he smiled actually i do he muttered something and i whipped out my wand blocking whatever curse he just tried to send at me i glared at him get away from me i said venomously and with a blink of the eye he darted forward and punched me in the eye i screamed and held my eye doubled over he didnthave to hit me that hard when i finally looked up with the one eye i could use they were gone in every direction i looked they were gone weird so then i started the long painful journey back to hogwarts oooooooooo i walked quickly through the library ignoring people looking at me probably thinking why the hec is she walking around with her hand clutched to her eye i walked to the back of the library a few bookcases in where i knew the health related books were i picked up the first that looked useful and brought it to the back table i flipped through the book until i found a spell that could conjure something close to an ice pack so i relaxed a bit closing my unusable eye and had with the ice pack pressed to my hurt eye what was their problem haventthey made me suffer enough hey i jumped and opened my eye remus sat in the chair across from me what i said in a neither cold nor nice tone what happened to your eye what happened to make you care he shrugged just wondering oh ok well i accepted voldemort well written note apparated to his secret base under a really big rock with his monkey minions and decided to join his death eater group along with all my beloved slytherins and i tripped on a tree stump on my way out and hit my eye on a magical mushroom that lets voldemort see whatever he wants when he pokes a spot on the stem i said rather coldly remus smiled what monkey minions i smiled too and beloved slytherins we both chuckled but really what happened the beloved slytherins they did that yep and they told me all about that note too and i was right about it to start with what did you say to start with well in the letter it was signed the dark lord volde stop saying his name right you know who may be evil but he isntdumb if he were dumb he wouldnthave been able to brainwash so many idiot slytherins also he said a dear friend of yours suggested that you might be interested and i donthave any death eater dear friends and why would he want a muggle born death eater to start with ya i think you re all really thick ya wait hey i smiled i mean come on ms i hate the house i got sorted in become a death eater honestly well it was possible i mean we all wondered why you were placed in slytherin and it just seemed to fit i to smart to follow some stupid guy around and get brainwashed into being his monkey minion we both laughed sorry donttell the rest of the marauders about this i want them to figure it out themselves but no just donttell them kay so i guess you ll have a black eye to go with that bump on your forehead i felt up with the hand that wasntholding an icepack i had completely forgotten that i got a bump from running into sirius where d you get that i ran into sirius in the corridor did he hit you no i mean i literally ran into sirius in the corridor he laughed i smiled you know you should probably go to the hospital wing but i dontwa go or i ll tell the boys the truth blackmail i grumbled as i got up and headed towards the hospital wing he laughed but as i was about to leave i turned back around hey thanks no problem oooooooooo the following is in 3rd person point of view remus stood up after autumn had left and sighed it was going to be had for him to not tell the rest of the marauders he still didntreally understand why autumn didntwant him to tell that the letter from you know who was a fake but well he said he would keep it a secret remus walked up to the griffindor common room at a slow pace and when he entered he found sirius and james playing wizard chess and peter watching hey moony have a good time in the library ya remus muttered got something on your mind james said as sirius moved a few pieces around on the chessboard no common moony for the 3 years i ve known you one thing we ve learned is how you act when you have something on your mind sirius said looking up as james stared at the chessboard hey you switched something didntyou james declared looking up at sirius no now why would i do that sirius exclaimed in defense you remus zoned them out as he took the opportunity to walk up to the dormitory he sat on his bed should he have told them he didntlike keeping this secret at all the next day autumn was in sitting in the back of the class again it felt like everything went back to the way it was in 1st year they sat in potions listening to the drone of the teacher go on about end of year tests autumn and remus secretly knew they were going to pass peter was nervous and james and sirius didntreally care one way or the other james whispered something to sirius and sirius glared back at autumn autumn glared back miss vilcent autumn sighed and looked forward yes sir could you repeat what i just said um no sorry sir detention see me after class james elbowed sirius and sirius sniggered can you repeat what i just said mr black sirius grin faded into a smile not really no sir well then i ll see both you and autumn to give detention times both autumn and sirius groaned so as i was saying the class cleared out and sirius and autumn walked to the front of the class do you two know why you re here autumn nodded while sirius said well not really sir could you explain to me mr black i think you know very well why you are here sirius shrugged you two will be serving detention tonight at 7 to clean and sort the school cauldrons both of the teenagers groaned you are dismissed ooooooo sirius showed up for detention ten minutes late while autumn had already started glad you decided to join us mr black the potions teachers said now i think you two can take care of yourselves behave and with that he left the room yes mother autumn mumbled but loud enough for sirius to hear i can behave can you behave sirius asked standing straight voldemort taught me to behave along with his monkey minions monkey minions forget it just grab a cauldron autumn said coldly bossy bossy ok i ll get right to it ma am autumn saluted him sarcastically and went back to cleaning the cauldron after about 10 minutes sirius looked up you werentserious about the voldemort thing right if i said i wasn t you wouldntbelieve me autumn said you re cold today you know that it a cold day hilarious sirius went back to scrubbing and autumn rolled her eyes and did the same um remus hasntsaid anything right autumn said nervous about what nothing never mind autumn stopped talking sirius smiled and chuckled what nothing autumn sneered in his direction hey could you hand me that brush thing a ma bob sirius looked up to see in what direction she was pointing then reached over and grabbed the brush and chucked it at her it hit her in the head and she fumbled for it ow autumn stood up brushed herself off and walked over to a bookcase looking at the spines of the books hmmm all of these about potions how boring we are in a potions class room mmm hmm autumn mumbled pretending to be deep in thought what are you doing this looks heavy enough and yet not so heavy perfect then autumn pulled out a book and threw it at sirius aiming at his head it ended up hitting him below the shoulder ah you still have bad aim he rubbed the spot he was hit he stood up to rinse out the cauldron at least i trust people what that suppose to mean well let see i haventtold a single person about the marauders i was a good friend to all of you i made it clear i didntwant to be in slytherin and yet you still accuse me of being a follower of voldemort because of some stupid letter than wasnteven real autumn was starting to get angry for those of you that are dumb and couldnttell sirius didntanswer he just walked over to autumn with the cauldron in his hands they stood face to face for a while exchanging glares when he lifted the cauldron above her head and dumped it out there was a very awkward and cold silence as autumn stood there soaking wet and sirius glaring at her all the anger that had been building up inside autumn for a long time finally came out and she snapped autumn darted forward and tackled sirius to the ground she pinned him to the ground and glared at him sirius flipped her around and they switched places sirius now had autumn pinned to the floor autumn struggled beneath him and after much effort was able to flip him around and they switched places again a n i know this all sounds wrong just dontthink about it like that sirius flipped her back on the floor without much effort what are you doing sirius yelled at her i dontknow taking it out on you i guess fine sirius pushed his hands down harder on her shoulders ow autumn noticed he didnthave her legs pinned so she kicked him where it counts a n i just love saying that sirius grimaced and cupped his hands around where it hurt a n it all sounds so hilarious to me at 11 00 pm autumn took the opportunity to tackle him to the floor again regaining her position now that just mean sirius ignoring the pain flipped her around again this time pinning her legs and her shoulders twice as hard ow that not fair life not fair get used to it autumn grumbled something and then struggled as best she could against him autumn sighed i give up and you re bruising me too bad you started this fight well i cantreally do anything right now still your fault autumn struggled again stop it no i feel stupid and helpless autumn felt sirius hold loosen so was the letter real no are you sure i happened to run into the makers which were a few stupid slytherins if it were real would you have accepted it what do you honestly think well if i knew i wouldntask you of course i wouldnthave good but why didntyou tell us sooner i did well i tried to but you guys either shunned me or didntlisten to me or were rambling and yelling um ya they were silent for a moment until sirius leaned down and kissed her this time slightly longer than the time before when they broke apart autumn said we haventfinished with the cauldrons and you ve bruised me sorry ok um do the others know about the letter being a fake autumn thought about telling sirius about remus knowing but decided against it nope just you oh ok you might want to dry off ya autumn dried herself off using her wand any bruises probably tomorrow i ll have these huge bruises on my shoulders and thighs i ll tell people i got attacked by voldemort monkey minions i dontget it sirius exclaimed frustrated with the joke forget it sirius grumbled you know we re only 13 right 14 whatever yes why dunno just weird um ok the rest of the night was spent with an awkward silence in the room while autumn and sirius scrubbed their detention away and another footnote and i proud to say you just read my longest and perhaps faveorite story i hate the whole flirty thing cause they are only 13 that how old i am btw but i also think it really cute but they arentboyfriend girlfriend now that was just a lil spark d ok

chapter say it aintso i will not go turn the lights off carry me home keep your head still i ll be your thrill the night will go on my little windmill all the small things blink 182 read with a dracula accent hello my name is yourboss i have some special news for you you may want to sit down in case of a sudden seizure muahahahahahahaha guahahahahahaha fuahahahahahaha cough i sorry that was random but i turned it in as an assignment one day and i thought it was funny never mind the actual chapter the relationship between autumn and the marauders only changed slightly since detention night sirius and remus no longer pestered autumn but neither of them told the other marauders about talking to autumn so peter and james remained ignorant of the situation autumn still sat alone the marauders still ate together but the slight changes in the two marauders brightened up autumn year just enough and that just about how it stayed for the rest of the year end of year tests were approaching and autumn was more prepared than ever as her 3rd year tests approached autumn worried as she did just about every year before the tests and yet she was always prepared but the thing autumn worried about most wasnther tests as it looked like but it was her having to leave hogwarts and enter the muggle world again with her not so loving father but she didntwant the marauders to know they might accidentally pity her it was early morning june 12th and tests were that day a n no idea when hogwarts gets out so lets just say it the 16th one month before hp6 her birthday had passed without event in fact autumn had forgotten about her birthday until the next day but she didntcare and life went on autumn woke with a jolt she wondered what had awoken her and she rubbed her eyes and flipped over onto her side to look out the window yes she finally succeeded in making a window and it worked with access to outside amazing no there was a barn owl outside her window tapping incessantly autumn moaned and got out of bed leaving her bed a mess she threw open a window hoping not to wake the slytherin girls she had to dorm with the bird flew in and dropped a letter on her bed autumn eyed the letter suspiciously then tiptoed over to retiues cage her owl and she couldntget rid of the name as it would only respond to that and grabbed an owl treat from a little container near her cage retiues looked angry but it looked like retiues realized it was not a time to be loud autumn tiptoed back over to the barn owl and gave it the treat it cooed in thanks and autumn shushed it the owl flew back out the window autumn walked over to her bed and quietly sat down on it she set the letter on the nightstand promising herself to read it in the morning when she got a proper rest she fell asleep autumn woke up shortly after falling asleep she had had a weird dream she was walking on the sidewalk to some very busy city when suddenly water started pouring into the streets slowly rising but when autumn woke up she found herself still in water she shot up and looked around the room was rapidly filling up with water and her dorm mates were starting to stir then squeal the water was already up past her bed and her pajama pants were already soaking wet autumn immediately ran for the door she twisted the knob and pulled it wouldntbudge she panicked the cold water was up past her stomach and still rising she swam for the window and attempted to open that too but it wouldntbudge either the other slytherin girls were frantically trying to get the door by shooting blasts from their wand at the door the water went past her shoulders and autumn pulled out her wand trying every spell she could think of on the window the water was quickly making the girls rise until there was only about two feet of air left autumn sucked in as much air as her lungs could hold and swam down under the surface looking for some way to get out before they all drowned she looked around frantically forgetting she is a human being and canthold her breath forever she swam up to the window and in desperation kicked the window as hard as she could under water at least she kicked the window again and finally realized that she needed to get air right then she swam upwards as fast as she could but before she could reach air she blacked out oooooooooooo think anyone will suspect us naw we arentworld famous yet sirius grinned we didnt hurt anyone did we besides anyone innocent would have been cleared out what in the bloody hell are you talking about padfoot james questioned nothing never mind sirius smiled so who wants to see our beautiful project all four marauders took the cue and bolted through the corridor towards the dungeons there was a certain way to get into the slytherin common room without being seen one part was a certain invisibility cloak and the other part was a small passage that led from a corridor straight into the slytherin common room a n i clueless here dontlook at me once invisibly there or however you explain them being somewhere and invisible the marauders quietly sneaked to the door of the girls dorm all four of them pressed their ears to the door hey you think she faking it a girl said from inside probably hey vilcent get up there was a scuffing sound like someone kicking the ground they kicked her she probably just passed out from pure terror let go dry off the marauders were completely silent as if they heard someone had just died until sirius and remus simultaneously said crap remus pointed to the door and muttered a spell that opened the door and allowed the boys in yes the boys into a girls dorm they learned how to do that a while ago the perverts after checking to make sure all the slytherin girls were in the bathroom drying off and getting ready for the day the four boys rushed over to autumn who was lying on the floor unconscious they started talking quietly we didntmean to james started what do we peter added sirius and remus were still dead silent she breathing sirius said calmly what remus asked she breathing the spell must have worn off right after she passed out and she got air in time so she ll wake up on her own james asked probably sirius answered probably ok fine yes well probably sirius said do we do cpr peter asked no it ll have no use she already breathing oh so what do we do remus asked they sat in silence for a moment canttake her to the hospital wing because they will figure we did something bad well we sorta did not helping peter sirius mumbled more to himself sorry ok lets just try to get her out of here first sirius hoisted autumn up and motioned for the other boys to get the invisibility cloak and put on them all it a tight fit it a good thing none of us have gotten a major growth spurt yet i guess ya remus said unsure of why sirius was joking around even a little so they took a soaking wet cold and unconscious autumn all the way into the griffindor common room and lay her by the fire doing everything they could think of to get her to wake up hey remus go conjure up an ice pack for us will you remus ran up to his dorm to grab a book on his way back lily stopped him what going on n nothing w we just um icepack lily blinked lupin what going on nothing remus said defensively and ran back over to where the rest of the marauders were lily followed she peered over james shoulder and saw autumn unconscious oh my gosh what happened to her all three of the other marauders turned their heads she hit her head ya lily raised an eyebrow you should take her to the hospital wing uh we should but see we cantand well james stuttered as lily sat down by him taking the icepack remus had conjured don t it ll only make it worse black go get a blanket potter go get a glass of water lily said suddenly very protective of autumn the boys all sat there and watched her help autumn well go sirius and james immediately shot up and ran to get the stuff and together they helped bring autumn back to consciousness autumn stirred for a while while the marauders and lily held their breath did i where am i autumn mumbled weakly as she looked around and struggled to sit up they all grinned relieved welcome to the griffindor common room lily said smiling you what happened did you read the letter sirius asked peter and james looked at him questioningly um oh no i was too tired i fell asleep why it told you to get out of the room it did james looked at sirius glaring so sirius glared back playfully autumn took her opportunity to move closer to the fireplace and wrap the gold and maroon blanket around herself tightly james laughed you re so obvious what sirius asked james chuckled nothing autumn meanwhile was taking in every bit of her surroundings she had so long wanted to be in that common room sitting where she was she brought the blanket up and covering her face and inhaled deeply taking in the scent of griffindor a n ha sirius and james kept arguing about something or another and autumn looked over to lily who was just sitting there watching james and sirius fight hey guys autumn said getting their attention ya sirius said thanks for saving me from drowning again no problem james said and sirius remus and peter nodded drowning lily asked well james started drowning in the pool of unconsciousness i mean autumn corrected and lily looked at her slightly suspicious but let it go so so sirius said so so the rest of them said simultaneously they all laughed griffindor autumn looked around again yep you guys are so lucky to come here everyday autumn sighed ya pretty lucky sirius said ya autumn sighed again hey what happened to our sworn rivalry with all slytherins james asked just wondering he said innocently sirius and remus looked down at the same time and amazingly autumn grinned ya what did happen to that boys sirius looked up and gave a quick glare to autumn they all waited for someone to say something mmmm looks like someone changed their mind huh autumn teased hey i have the weird feeling that i missed something james said a little sirius mumbled really do tell james said mischievously uh i think i ll go finish up my homework lily said taking a hint she got up and went to the girls dorm how can she do homework it 4 am on a sunday james asked and sirius rolled his eyes who knows james maybe she remembered a huge essay you think shut up prongs and it seemed like james may have finally gotten it so what did i miss james asked back to the original question autumn sirius and remus looked at him and peter prodded the fire clueless to what was going on autumn and sirius exchanged glances and autumn started well see about that letter ya i remember that letter well i was right about to begin with slytherins made it and um i met up with them at the lake you met up with them not on purpose well anyways they told me about the letter how would you let me finish already honestly so they told me about the letter and how they framed me then one guy punched me for who knows what reasons just to bug me i guess then i went to the library to find a book on medicines and stuff to make an icepack and remus saw me and came to check on me and i told him about how the letter was a fake and i got him to promise not to tell you guys so you could figure it out on your own it was sirius turn to interrupt he knew first remus nodded happy with himself and he did keep it a secret so that why you were all freaky that one day moony remus looked at james bashfully and autumn started talking again anyways in class a while later well you were there and sirius and i got detentions then that was a funny day james said and all four of the others said shut up ok ok james said so during detention sirius looked slightly worried i had time to tell sirius about it and he promised not to tell the others either and so he did sirius let out a slight sigh and that was that so i guessing that was your prank down in the slytherin dorm yeah james said and i sent you a letter telling you to get out but noooo you were too tired to read it right then well sorry i didntexpect the dorm would start filling up with water a few hours later excuse me for being so dumb you re excused sirius said smiling autumn stuck her tongue out at him and he just grinned back so you re not a slytherin james said looking at autumn autumn smiled not a drop of slytherin blood in me well then welcome to griffindor sirius grinned ok then my loooongest chapter yet go me i liked this chapter a lot and it shows that lily isntreally evil at all just happens to be in griffindor very very happy with the ending although the whole drowing again thing damsel in distress is a bit cheesy oh well i needed it there and hec autumn is a damsel in

drop of slytherin blood in me well then welcome to gryffindor sirius grinned autumn was just about as happy as a 14 year old could get her friends no longer thought she was an evil monkey minion and well that alone made her happy at around 4 am on the day of their final tests autumn was sitting around the gryffindor fireplace with the marauders at around 5 am autumn had found her way to the couch and fallen asleep on it minutes later the boys fell asleep where they were 8 am was panic time autumn had woken up from someone shaking her awake autumn moaned and turned over i thought you might want some time to cram sirius whispered autumn turned back over and opened her eyes while recalling everything that happened the last few hours hm cram for the exams today sirius said after he stopped shaking her exams shhhh autumn bolted upright ran to the common room entrance and stopped turning back to face sirius she whispered i dontknow the way to the library room from here i ll show you he whispered back why are we whispering sirius pointed to the area next to the fireplace autumn saw three figured curled up the marauders had fallen asleep near the fireplace aw look at the little kiddies falling asleep by the fire so tempting to wake their little widdle selves up sirius shocked by the sudden baby talk paused for a second then said i wouldn t why not james would curse you peter would probably turn over and smack you and remus would start yelling along with james fun i think i ll pass this time good idea she smiled will you escort a lady yes ma am sirius walked over to autumn and all formal like linked his arm with hers autumn mind flashed back to when she was talking to remus why thank you young man will you escort a lady no autumn looked up at sirius to her left and smiled oooooooooooo it done autumn flung her arms in the air after the last exam of the year finally huh sirius came out of the classroom right after her yey autumn said and threw her arms in the air about to hug sirius out of pure joy uh ya just a little caught up there autumn said as she dropped her arms to her sides s ok we re all happy sirius said and autumn smiled we need to celebrate we could or we could go cheer james on for what he trying out for quidditch he hoping for chaser really that great celebration enough for me autumn smiled and sirius led the way out to the quidditch pitch they ran quickly over to the stands before the try outs could start do you think he has a good chance of making it i know he going to make it his father taught him how to fly when he was little i cantpicture james little autumn looked over to sirius i cantpicture any of the marauders little actually i ve got an album i can show you later guys keep albums actually james mum made it for him as a christmas present last year it only has pictures of james and i how long have you two known each other forever i suppose well i think we met at the ministry as toddlers aw then there wouldntbe pictures of you as a wittle baby dontworry she added those in anyways autumn giggled shhh try outs are starting the captain of the gryffindor team talked about what they were going to do he explained and autumn had been wondering why they were trying out at the end of the year it because one of the chasers was expelled and they still had one match before the end of the year a n aka a sorry excuse i made to have the try outs here the people tried out and the captain excused them come on let go meet him outside of the locker rooms kay oooooooooooo sirius yelled as james came out autumn jumped at the sudden outburst sirius clapped james on the back new chaser of the quidditch team coming through that was so bloody awesome autumn snorted softly amused at the amount of enthusiasm sirius had calm down mate i haventmade it yet come on yes you did he right you probably did autumn said as they started walking through the corridor since when did you know anything about quidditch james asked i dontreally but i could tell by the team faces it was obvious who they favored autumn smiled really really autumn said seriously sirius said seriously a n hahaha seriously sirius said seriously i couldnthelp myself ok now we celebrate james exclaimed pumped up how sirius asked i dunno well we haventgone swimming in a while swimming you mean in the lake with the giant squid wonthurt you unless

interrupted autumn stuck her tongue out at both of them then dontwe need to get swimsuits nope i wearing white sirius grinned mischievously but didntanswer pervert sirius laughed i just kidding did you not notice that we re heading towards the slytherin common room oh sirius laughed again they reached her common room ok go in and we ll go to our common room and get dressed but in 10 minutes we ll be back and come in whether you are fully dressed or not autumn stood there with her hands on her hips until sirius said 9 and a half minutes and autumn took him seriously and ran in luckily she was able to find a swimsuit and change under the 10 minute limit and put shorts and a t shirt over it along with her robes so she wouldntbe looked at weird walking through the halls she came out of the common room and sirius and james were waiting damn sirius said and only 30 seconds left too autumn smacked him in the back of the head playfully and they all headed outside once outside and by the lake they all threw their robes under a tree and autumn sat down under the tree and held her legs and put her forehead on her knees sirius and james pulled their shirts off and sirius eyed autumn you re not backing out now are you they heard a muttered maybe you re such a wimp so autumn mumbled fine sirius reached down and picked autumn up like he would a baby and walked her over to the lake while she was saying no no no no no no no he walked into the lake until he was up to his calves and threw her in she surfaced immediately and grabbed his arm to pull him in he didntmove she pulled harder not fair you re heavier than me he grinned james came up behind sirius and signaled to autumn to be quiet autumn tried not to smile james came up and pushed sirius in the water right as autumn jumped out of the way james gave autumn a high five and they both started laughing sirius surfaced and spat water at james through his teeth that disgusting james exclaimed i know sirius said as he quickly reached out grabbed both of their arms and pulled them both in at the same time once james and autumn both emerged sirius pumped a fist in the air cheering at his victory two at the same time whooo shut up james said ruffling his hair autumn laughed what james asked you look so much different with your hair flat down on your head and surprisingly he smiled autumn smiled back then turned to sirius and waded through the water to him then reached up and ruffled his hair what that for sirius asked you look better with your hair messed up fashion advice from you sirius asked i look good all the time he said grinning well then you definitely need fashion advice from me james laughed at this and sirius scowled and then splashed autumn autumn stood there for a second then splashed him back sirius splashed james and that set off a classic water fight some time passed like that and they were all soaking wet when autumn said the sun set so sirius said lightly splashing her so it getting cold and we re all going to catch out death out here autumn said lightly splashing him back nah if we get really cold then we ll go inside besides it summer sirius said splashing james but the giant squid always attacks at night james smiled holy freaking crap a n holy freaking crap is sort of an inside joke autumn said rushing to get out of the water woa i just kidding james said pulling her back in not funny autumn said breathing hard from trying to get out so fast very funny sirius said mocking autumn autumn turned to sirius to say something when something grabbed her ankle autumn screamed and lunged to grab hold of sirius as james emerged cracking up james looked at autumn hanging from sirius neck and just laughed harder a n ok guys picture scooby doo jumping onto and clinging to shaggy neck when he scared see it now she out of the water completely hanging onto his neck autumn let go and blushed sorry ya sirius said ignoring james cracking up that wasntfunny autumn suddenly

mouth slightly open after a few seconds of doing this sirius waved a hand in front of her trying to snap her out of her trance hello sirius said while waving his hand autumn grabbed his wrist mid wave and whispered he came what look autumn said motioning towards an area in the crowd and let go of his wrist sirius followed her gaze and fell upon a familiar looking man crap sirius said and

he came what look autumn said motioning towards an area in the crowd and let go of his wrist sirius followed her gaze and fell upon a familiar looking man crap sirius said and involuntarily grabbed and intertwined hands with autumn 8888888888 um well i guess my dad decided to pick me up huh autumn said nervously ya i guess so sirius replied with equal nervousness nervousness is a funny word it was then that autumn noticed she was holding hands with sirius and james was grinning they immediately let go and stepped two feet away from each other they both blushed but autumn had more important things to worry about she walked over to her dad and he finally spotted her autumn h hi dad then suddenly mr vilcent lifted both his arms and sirius automatically lurched forward slightly but amazingly her father just bend down and hugged her autumn looked shocked and just stood there sirius walked up with very good posture and cleared his throat mr vilcent let go of his daughter to see sirius good afternoon mr vilcent you ve got a great daughter there autumn gave sirius an amused look yes i do donti sirius and autumn exchanged glances well i ll be keeping in contact with her to make sure everything is ok autumn finally understood what sirius was doing great mr vilcent said as james walked up to sirius mocking his posture and slapped sirius on the back we ll all be keeping in contact with her yup mr vilcent smiled well be best get going see you boys bye sir bye autumn sirius smiled bye mr vilcent bye fall girl james grinned as mr vilcent was confused at the name they called her bye autumn said smiling nervously and the two of them turned to go to her father car james and sirius exchanged nervous glances 8888888888888 autumn sat on her bed still not quite over the shock of her father hugging her he hadntyelled at all that day and she was confused as to why he was suddenly so nice to her maybe because he finally realized he had a great daughter naw that just not possible autumn sighed changed into her pajamas and brushed her teeth then she went back and sat on her bed grabbing a book as a hard surface to write on she pulled out a piece of parchment a quill and ink to write a letter to sirius she wrote sirius i saw you guys only hours ago and i already feel lonely it nice to have friends i remember how long i had no friends and then i was placed in slytherin to make things worse i still wonder why i was put in slytherin i mean i told the sorting hat to put me in slytherin because i had thought i made a friend that was put in slytherin but the hat doesntalways listen to the person if he thinks their choice was wrong and i was wrong wasnti there had to be some reason i was placed in slytherin what is it well i came home and my father treated me the same way he treated me at king cross it awkward being around him but he hasntyelled at my or slapped me at all do you think he changed maybe i should take advantage of this and get my hogsmead permission form signed how are you getting along with your family it must be horrible to be trapped with your family and not have james to go to when things get rough i guess life is hard sometimes huh always here for you fall girl p s thanks for what you did at king cross autumn send the letter off with retiues her owl name remember i had to look for it i so ashamed of myself turned out the lights and fell asleep 888888888 a couple of weeks passed and autumn father was still acting awkwardly nice to her and autumn just went along with it she got her hogsmead permission slip signed finally and she didntquestion him being nice at all but she still waited for a letter from sirius to help her out she finally got it she was at the park leaning against a tree when retiues found her and dropped a letter at her feet then immediately flew to hunt for food autumn smiled at the parchment and then opened it season girl i have no idea why you were placed in slytherin there had to be some reason i sure i would be careful around your father donttrust him if there one thing i ve ever learned it that you cantalways trust your family he probably wants something that you have just be careful ok i doing fine i guess i ve been avoiding my family as much as possible although avoiding people who live in the same house as you is pretty hard i have to eat and sometimes it has to be with the rest of my family it always ends in someone yelling and usually me leaving to house to cool off for a while but then i always have to come back you have no idea how relieving it is to see retiues and then read your letter i cantwait till september when we all get back together oh ya like the new name season girl hah i crack myself up sometimes your crazy friend sirius autumn smiled at the last note and hauled herself up to get home to write back clearly it was going to be a very letter filled summer 8888888888 autumn i need to talk to you mr vilcent yelled from the first floor of the house coming autumn answered and came down the stairs she found her father sitting at the table waiting for her sit down she did so what mr vilcent got straight to the point well a few months ago you got a letter in the mail now see your mother always had her own bank account that she never combined with mine when she passed away the bank said she had wanted to money to go to you he waved a letter and this is the document that makes it official but as you are still a minor you cannot use the money at all but you could tell the bank to deposit the money into my account and you bastard autumn yelled the only reason you ve been nice to me these few months was because you wanted my mother money how could you be so selfish damnit there no way i giving you that money autumn quickly swiped the envelope and stormed into her room slamming the door she quickly started to throw things she needed into her hogwarts trunk autumn heard the refrigerator open and close about 10 minutes later she heard her door open and her father enter get out now autumn warned her father you know you have to give me that money no i don t it written to me i donthave to give you anything autumn said bitterly her father walked up to her and quickly slapped her across the face with the back of his hand it was silent for a few seconds as autumn abruptly stopped packing and froze she wasntabout to give her father the satisfaction of knowing it hurt her so with tears stinging her eyes she glared at her father he grabbed her shoulders and slammed her against the wall hard she gasped as he started yelling about something but she was too scared to make out anything all she knew was that he was slamming her into the wall repetitively until she couldnttake it anymore and cried he slapped her again to get her attention are you listening to me he said slapping her again and she nodded quickly he then threw her to the floor took the letter that she had dropped and left a very frightened autumn to cry a few minutes later autumn was able to regain composure and stand up she packed the rest of her stuff and left the house through the bathroom window she had learned in past years that this window had the easiest route to the ground than any other window on the second floor the sun had just set and autumn had no idea where to go she decided to first go to the ever familiar park to sit and write a letter to sirius briefly describing what was going on and how she was now sitting in the park with no idea what to do and then waited for retiues to come back when her owl finally came back she sent the letter with her and thought to herself what am i getting myself into she stood up and walked into the small forest towards the back of the park where was she supposed to go home was just about out of the question and that about the only place she knew she sighed and trudged up a small hill and sat next to a tree she d learn to love this forest and she leaned against a tree trunk and fell asleep with many worries on her mind 888888888888 autumn a voice said softly autumn autumn was nudged awake autumn slowly opened her eyes to find her knight in shining armor she blinked her sleep away then stood up quickly and hugged him hard sirius you have no idea how happy i am to see you autumn said honestly sirius hugged her back same here autumn autumn finally let go of sirius slightly smiling how how did you get all the way out here and find me here autumn asked sirius i ve got my ways sirius smiled yes but dontthink about it i here thank you so much i owe you one sure do he smiled jokingly autumn smiled she couldntbe happier in her situation so how your family do you really want to know sirius answered i suppose i already know the answer huh ya let talk about why i really here sirius said his smile turning to a more nervous smile i suppose so autumn said reluctantly then went over and sat under the tree she had slept against sirius followed well he i think he was drunk autumn said what do you mean you think well he open and closed the refrigerator and then around 10 minutes later he came up all red faced and yelling she sighed i not used to this kind of thing no one should be used to it it a big deal yes but he didntactually beat me or anything doesntmatter it shouldnthave happened in the first place right i suppose so where are you planning on staying i would invite you over but my parents wouldntbe too keen on having a muggle born living under the same roof ya i guess not autumn smiled you could go over to remus place i sure they d be happy to have you there maybe or peter s i get the feeling he doesntlike me much nonsence peter loves everyone he just sorta shy ok there was a period of silence then i feel oddly safe right now same here i dunno why ya there was a few minutes of silence again where both teenagers stared off into the forest so did he get the document sirius asked ya he did but it doesntmean anything without my signature oh ok good yup silence i not used to you being quiet hey what you re not i can be can t can let see who can be quiet the longest why you lose see hey i wasntready too bad autumn found herself grinning sirius chuckled and autumn joined in after laughing for a while autumn said that felt good what laughing yeah it did so how does it feel to be sitting in the middle of a forest with the king of hotness sirius said playfully scooting closer to autumn and leaning in towards her really oh my gosh where is he oh hilarious sirius said backing off autumn giggled dontworry you re still the hottest guy in this forest autumn said with a smile sirius grinned then let his grin fade with realization but i the only guy in this forest exactly autumn smiled you re so mean to me sirius said with a playful grin i know so um how did you really get here autumn asked sirius chuckled well i ve got that broom over there he said gesturing towards a broom leaning against a tree near them oh didntsee that and then sirius pointed upwards there a gap in the forest so it was easy to find you sitting here oh but now that i here i dontfeel as heroic as i did when i decided to come find you you know your owl is really fast ya retiues is like that oh i remember her name now we named it yes you did i like the name and yet you couldntremember it hey it a hard name to remember sure it is sirius i sure it is autumn autumn sighed in defeat and it was silent for a moment again what are we suppose to do now i mean we cantsit here forever we could try autumn glared at him well i dontknow i only had it planned up to finding you good going autumn said sarcastically thank you no problem this is pointless isntit sirius asked what is pointless sitting here talking no i mean it calms us i guess so it pointless yeah i guess boys are so dull ha boys are dull how many pranks have you pulled in the past year sirius laughed um exactly dull psh autumn stuck her tongue out at him and then stood up and brushed herself off where are you going sirius asked i dontknow but this is getting dull she answered putting emphasis on the word dull would it be ok for me to come along maybe maybe sure ok then we re doing it again doing what talking pointlessly yes i remember it dull she said in mock anger and stormed off into the forest wait i confused sirius said more to himself then ran and caught up with autumn after grabbing his broom you know what autumn asked sirius chicken butt ha remind me to laugh when i think you re funny ok what i fulfilled one of my mother hopes which was to make friends you have friends where but to sirius surprise autumn just smiled with small tears in her eyes and looked up at him what sirius asked concerned are you mad at me no i just miss her oh you know what i did what i forgot about my girlfriend from second year what how can you just forget about a girlfriend oh she was a slutty 12 year old she went from one boyfriend to another every week still i never broke up with her autumn laughed really really really flashback guess what sirius said looking happy chicken butt autumn suggested darn you got it really really really oh autumn said dumbfounded guess what james asked chicken butt autumn and sirius yelled in unison no actually end autumn laughed staring off into space what sirius asked waving a hand in front of her face dontyou just hate it when people do that when you were thinking so hard about something and they make you snap out of it evil people oh nothing i just remembered something funny from the past did it have me in it of course how could something be so funny without your face autumn grinned yes i kn wait that an insult isntit sure is and you just agreed with it so anyways i found out that my girlfriend forgot about me too because i saw her snogging some random guy in the corridor autumn guffawed that what you get what did i do well you are just about the biggest guy slut in the school guy slut wait no i not what a guy slut well it not that hard to figure out autumn said suddenly looking stern i not a slut or a girly man i never said you were a girly man but if you really want me to think that no ok girly man autumn said a smile playing on her lips not oh whatever i have no energy left for this then they were silent for a few minutes as they walked deeper into the woods then eventually a clearing appeared and they could see a city far in the distance civilization sirius yelled melodramatically and got on his broom and sped off to the city hey autumn yelled as he zoomed past her sirius turned back and landed next to her just kidding sure you were you forgot allll about me autumn said wiping a fake tear i sorry sirius put a hand on his heart i need heart surgery he said as if her were in a soap opera that ok she paused dramatically then put the back of her hand on her forehead as if looking faint before you go i have to tell you i pregnant with james baby ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ok a little to far there no really i am there was a moment in silence james is very rough and he prefers the lights on ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh too much information you you re not happy for me there was another pause are you serious then he eyed her telling her not to crack a joke about the whole sirius serious thing yes then she crumpled down on the floor with her face in her hands and shoulders shaking autumn he said started to believe it he kneeled down next to her and put a hand on her shoulder comfortingly at the same time autumn lifted her head to show that she was cracking up she laughed at the look on sirius face and then just stood up still laughing hey that was not funny yes it was you should have seen the look on your face i mean honestly can you imagine me being the type to get pregnant at this age and with james no less ha ha ha still dontthink it funny only because you were the victim to the joke my friend down in cali played the same joke on me on april fools day and i knew it was april fools day but she dragged it on for so long that i started to believe it i think i even got all teary but anyways a brownie for ande who can make someone believe a joke on april 1st anyways whatever sirius said smiling slightly come on gullible hey i resent that uh huh come on girly man i resent that even more too bad black autumn said playfully and pulled him out into the clearing there was a field about the size of a football field with all grass and it was especially pretty because it was summer this is where i come to think well during the day i go in the forest but then it gets creepy in the forest so i go here and you re rambling sorry it ok how bout i teach you how to fly he said raising his broom slightly i already know how autumn said stubbornly oh really then you would have no problem showing me then sirius said handing her the broom she stared at it then sighed ok fine teach me the ways of the almighty broom i thought so dontget a big head too late my head if full of brains or rocks either way it full of something right sure ok as i was saying you get on the broom obviously sirius cleared his throat then you kick off and point the broom where you want it to go simple enough um ok here sirius said handing her the broom now get on ok kick off autumn nervously kicked off from the ground and immediately panicked just lean it back down sirius yelled up to her and she tilted the broom down as far as she could and she zoomed back to the ground and fell off hard she moaned and rolled onto her back she could hear sirius laughing at her and she just ripped up a handful of grass and attempted to throw it at him but missing by far this just made him laugh harder she heard him walk over to her and with her eyes closed she kicked him she heard a yelp and then a thump next to her she opened her eyes to see sirius holding himself on the floor haha this has happened twice now now it was autumn turn to laugh sirius eventually got over the pain i a girl i have no idea how long it takes for the pain to go away or how much it hurts so bear with me and flipped over on his back also silence washed over them as they looked up at the stars there sirius said pointing up what it sirius sirius ya the constellation where sirius outlined it in the sky autumn took a few minutes to examine the sky this is relaxing autumn mumbled tired yeah it is dontyou wish every night could be like this just looking up at the sky with nothing to do autumn was silent autumn auuuuuttuuuuummmnn sirius looked over at her and saw her peacefully sleeping sirius smiled turned over and faced opposite of autumn and fell asleep himself arentyou proud of me it such a long chapter also i was kind of hesitant to post this chapter because i know someone is going to flame me for it oh well i

88888888888888888 sirius sirius come on wake up mmmup sirius grumbled opening his eyes and found autumn over him well finally autumn said trying to get him to stand up but failing what the rush there is no rush but i ve been waiting for an hour for you to wake up and it was getting all creepy being alone besides you snore i do not do don t whatever just please get up i up where are we supposed to go now autumn asked well how should i know i got away from my house you got away from yours i only planned it to getting you remember well we have to eventually plan on going somewhere yeah well we could go to remus or peter place we autumn they heard someone call in the distance immediately autumn thought it to be her father and exchanged glances with sirius just then someone walked into the clearing autumn recognized him as not her father but a neighbor that she hadnttalked to since forever eric autumn said running and hugging her neighbor tightly leaving sirius utterly confused autumn i haventseen you in years you ve grown autumn took a step back from him and scanned him he had the same dark blue eyes as always his dark brown hair had grown out a bit and he had gotten so much taller and more muscular he was now more than a head taller then her even though he was only slightly older then her well so have you wow eric you ve gotten huge huge as in fat or huge as in muscular autumn grinned and eric playfully flexed autumn laughed along with eric as sirius cleared his throat oh right eric this is sirius black sirius this is eric miller eric grinned and reached out to shake sirius hand sirius smiled and took it there now you ve met sirius i knew eric before first year he used to be a neighbor of ours up until he moved he was my best friend how did you know i d be here eric oh well we just moved back in and you moved back in that great eric smiled yeah and i went to ask your dad where you were and when he said he didntknow i figured you would be either in the park forest or here well i guess you were right i missed you so much well i missed you too eric said and they hugged again too much mushy stuff sirius exclaimed as they broke apart haha sorry sirius um eric isntexactly like us sirius raised an eyebrow and eric said confused not exactly like you guys how oh well you dontgo to our school sirius finally understood what autumn had meant eric was a muggle oh eric said not convinced but let it go so are you two you know autumn laughed nervously going out no we re just friends he came over because my dad hasntbeen that great recently eric mum died there was a rush of silence before eric said softly oh i sorry so am i i have to go help my parents unpack but i ll see you around ok ok autumn smiled as he turned and left wow eric is back in town yeahhhhh so that was weird is he a muggle yeah i pretty sure he is he moved away before i got my first hogwarts letter so who knows he could be a wizard himself but as he only moved a short distance away he would have probably gone to hogwarts mmm hmm sirius said not interested he was my only source of comfort when i was feeling down he was an awesome friend uh huh sirius are you jealous no why would i be well suddenly you are standing all stiff and cantsound happy that my long lost friend has just come back i just dontknow him that well is all right sirius whatever you say there was a tense silence between the two teenagers and autumn crossed her arms you know after eric moved away i was pretty much alone and then i came to hogwarts and there were a few boys who always just seemed to make it all worse hmmm hey we never held anything against you personally doesntmatter does it you still made my life a living hell why are you suddenly mad at me i should have been mad at you a long time ago yes but now i mean honestly i came all this way for you to yell at me about being a jerk in first year ug autumn said banging a knuckle against her forehead you re right of course i woah you just agreed with me dontpush it sirius put both hands up in defeat and autumn smiled at him i hungry yeah so am i summer over in a few days think you can battle out your hunger for a few days autumn gave him a skeptical look yeah neither can i a growing boy needs to eat you know uh huh what are we supposed to do eat each other limbs yes because your right arm looks so delicious but that my slinging arm your slinging arm yes see sirius said walking to the left side of autumn and slinging his arm around her neck oh autumn said lifting his arm off her well then i ll take your left arm only if i can have your ear my ear yes ears are the crunchy part autumn scrunched up her face and there was an awkward silence what i was kidding autumn grunted when the next full moon not soon the last one was about a week ago you think remus would take us in for a few days probably right then do you want to try sure but first i want to show you something cool autumn gave him a curious look watch sirius closed his eyes and within seconds transformed into a big shaggy black dog awwww you re a puppy autumn said dropping to her knees and scratching behind his ears and talking to him as if he were a baby wittle pwuppy and isha cute dwoggy were a few of the things autumn said while petting the dog then i like padfoot better than girly man the dog barked and autumn laughed and stood up sirius transformed back with his hands on his hips and a fake sad expression on his face autumn was still grinning did you mean it yes padfoot talks less than sirius hey well it true but you still love me right oh yes sirius i just adore you autumn said sarcastically i know you do take your hands off your hips it makes you look even more like a girl hey i am a very manly man autumn laughed 888888888888888888888 i dontlike the knight bus never again autumn thought to herself after getting off the bus and trying not to throw up was that your idea i dontknow sirius said leaning against a fence for support autumn sighed is this his house autumn said motioning towards the house they were closest to sirius nodded his head and she grabbed his hand impatiently and dragged him up towards the house chapter 2 dancing in the rain yey i finally got this chapter up i know i not that great of an author but dontwreck my confidence by being really mean in the reviews if you have constructive critisisim then thats great i neeeeed it but dontjust go and insult me it hurts me feeeelings hehe d marissa thank you you are my first real reviewer kerry you dontcount because i told you to review hehe yes funny is my middle name well no it not but whatever i think you ll like the little conversation between the sandy haired boy and autumn i started laughing while i wrote it it ll get more funny if she makes friends d on to chapter 2 i had a gut feeling when i was sitting on that stool to get sorted a gut feeling to follow what the hat said the hat seemed so i dunno knowledgeable but nope i stubborn and i was placed in slytherin instead of griffindor and there i was sitting at the very end of the slytherin table alone i guess i should be used to being alone but i thought just this once maybe i could make friends maybe this once i could be happy you can imagine the news of me being muggle born spread fast so the slytherins hated me for being muggle born and the rest of the school hated me for being a slytherin whoot this year i overheard there were more slytherin 7th years leaving than there were 1st years so luckily there was room at the end of the table for me to sit alone there that word again alone oh joy oh well i still a witch that has to count for something right right there i go answering my own questions again i going to stop rambling now i stared off into space secretly wondering what it would have been like to be a griffindor i looked over at the griffindor table three boys were yelling and laughing about something hilarious and there was a shy looking boy sitting next to them smiling at the joke i wondered how it would have been to been a part in that joke i snapped out of it and looked down at the rest of the slytherin table maybe they werentthat bad maybe they just prejudged me i sighed and looked at the schedule that was just given to me by a prefect potions with the griffindors i looked over at the griffindor side of the class they looked like they were enjoying themselves for the most part i was sitting in the back of the class all by my lonesome self but actually this time i kind of liked it the rest of the class seemed either to excited or boring i tilted my head at the four boys i saw earlier i remembered one of them to be black sirius because of the sorting and he went first that was just before i zoned everything out they didntlook to innocent to me they kept side glancing the slytherin side of the room although i not sure why he looked over at me more than the others did he like me i got my hopes up too fast at the end of the class i had successfully made some greenish potion i had just followed the instructions i didnteven know what it did i looked up at the board some potion that made your eyes sting real bad whatever i got full marks and that all that mattered i looked back over at sirius why did he keep glancing at me it was making me feel really paranoid then finally the messy haired boy next to sirius grabbed a goblet dipped it into the potion and handed it to sirius i looked up at the board is that what we were suppose to be doing i looked back over at sirius he pointed his wand at it muttered something did he know magic already and the potion came hurdling towards me smack the greenish potion hit me straight in the face and because i couldntclose my eyes fast enough it got me right in the eyes too i screamed and hit the floor after that i think i blacked out because i dontremember what happened between there and a room that looked like a hospital room i learned later that it was called the hospital wing i figured i d be going there a few times that year if the griffindors got their way what jerks i woke up to bright sunlight how long had i been there i sat up and felt a tingling in my eyes i blinked a few times and the feeling went away i looked around and found a rather chubby lady walking towards me oh my dear you are awake nasty potion that was dontwant to get off at a bad start on your first day do you i nodded oh my name is madame clark you ll be out of here in no time now drink this then relax a bit and you can go do you think you could make yourself cry dear it would make the process so much faster i dontmean to pressure you but if you could try i didnteven have to try i just turned my head into the pillow after she left and cried my troubles away i eventually fell asleep crying tires you out anyone who has ever cried a lot would know that when i woke up again my eyes felt completely normal i decided to stay there until the next morning therefore missing the rest of the first day of classes the next morning at breakfast i decided not to glare at the marauders which they now call themselves i decided to just give them a pitiful look you know the kind with the big puppy eyes pleading for mercy if that didntsend them on a guilt trip i dontknow what would but when i did this to sirius he just glared at me what had i ever done to them anyways didntthey see i wasntexactly the most involved slytherin motions towards loneliness ug stupid boys well it not just the guys it the whole damn school i thinking too much again i guess i ll go to yet another day of potions the rest of the say was just how it sounds boring and eventless except the fact the messy haired boy james i found out his name finally tripped me on my way to my first class of transfiguration my papers went everywhere and i was late for my first class i utterly despise that kid i ve decided to be a bit more optimistic in life it a good goal for me actually i going to eat more candy that doesntkill me jump away from me or make me want to throw up and then i ll be hyperer more hyper yey and i ll start reading comedy books or something and i ll study a whole bunch so i ll feel confident in class and i ll ignore the marauders it a long list of goals but what the hec i cantbelieve my goals are actually working i studying a lot in my free time forget the funny books i have to study and i the best student in almost all of my classes except maybe transfiguration professor mcgonagall still wontforgive me for being late that one day well i ve stayed out of trouble most of the time and i ve only been sent to the hospital wing once and that was because some slytherin knocked a bludger at me when i was studying in the stands during practice time and i broke my nose remind me to never study there again and you ll never guess i think i might actually make a friend with a griffindor well not really i didntremember his name but i remembered he was the guy who told me to put my hood up on the boats on the first day of school he came over to me reading in an unused classroom how did he know i was there i forgot to ask he came in pocketed a piece of parchment and sat next to me before i noticed him when i finally did notice him i gave a tiny little gasp and scooted away from him even though he wasntclose to me to begin with he gave a slight tilt of his head then said could i talk to you i tried to think of something witty to say but i gave up and just shrugged o ok he looked like he was about to open his mouth to apologize for being an idiot but then looked up from the floor and said actually never mind then quickly got up and left i shrugged and went back to studying is it just hard to be nice around me or something because it seemed like he was about to apologize for a second there but then decided differently then i looked up from my book realizing i hadntsoaked in a word so i just got up and walked back to the slytherin common room i stood up and ran over to a window threw back the curtains and found bricks i had forgotten the slytherin common room was underground but i needed to get outside so i ran out of the common room and sprinted to the main doors desperate for fresh air when i finally reached the huge doors i pulled them open a crack stepped outside and closed it behind me i looked out still under the cover it was raining it was raining hard it didntmatter i took off my robes and so i only had my school shirt and skirt on and ran outside headed for a bench on the way there i span and twirled getting soaking wet and i smiled i missed my own genuine smile it was a good feeling to smile i walked over and sat on the bench closest to a really big tree a n no not the whomping willow and just relaxed i think i may have fallen asleep in the rain because i dontknow what happened for a while for some reason i wasntcold at all even though it was the middle of fall when i finally did wake up i laughed at how stupid i must have looked sitting there in pouring hard rain and even better wearing white i took a deep breath and stood up it was saturday so i didnthave classes but i still didntwant to catch my death so i crossed my arms in front of my chest and ran under cover but not yet inside i preformed a very simple drying spell on my shirt but i could only get my shirt to dry off which was good enough for me i walked inside and bolted to my common room ignoring the odd stares i got from people seeming to say what the hec was she doing out in the rain she could have caught her death out there who is she anyways well at least i finally being noticed i not sure if that was the way i wanted to be noticed but oh well right before i was able to enter the corridor that led to the dungeons somebody grabbed my arm mid sprint it was the sandy haired kid again he looked at my worryingly and said simply why are you wet because because yes because because why because because because because why remus tilted his head a smile playing at his lips then i laughed a bit because i was bored so i went outside i grinned you were bored so you went outside in the rain he asked yes i was enjoying myself the stupid conversation was really actually funny riiiiiiight then i think i ll let you go change why thank you young man will you escort a lady no no why no because no because why no because because common because you are in slytherin and i would be killed if i was found walking you to your common room he finally said flat out my face fell but i tried to keep a smile on my face even though it wasntworking well oh ok i forgot that i was i mean o never mind i need to go learn how to dry my hair i said nervously he smiled at this i was now thinking he was very thick couldnthe see i was sad and he smiles oh that easy he took a step back pointed at me and muttered some spell that completely dried me off i grinned thanked him and walked back to the slytherin common room alone please review

down as if nothing had happened you know you really didnthave to tackle him to do that i said pointedly yes but it was so much more dramatic to tackle him james said smiling pink is not my color sirius said and i laughed at him it fits your new nickname what his new nickname remus asked you donthave to tell them girly man girly man james asked about to start laughing yeah it kind of a long story though i said laughing at the expression on sirius face i happened to like pink hair on him i reached over and ruffled his pink hair no matter how hard he tried to pull me off he couldn t until finally i got bored with his pink hair and tried to start up a new topic of conversation how bout cute little puppies i like puppies sirius groaned as i brought this up and started using my baby talk wittle puppy ears shut up james yelled trying to block out the sound of my voice by covering his ears with the palms of his hands well fine if he didntwant to talk about wittle puppies then he d have to start up a topic of his own to last the rest of the train ride candy i jumped up and bought a few things off the trolley as it rolled by our compartment after we sat back down and i was eagerly eating candy james said are you sure you need any more candy i started giggling uncontrollably autumn sirius said seriously there i go again yes sirius you need to calm down psh we switched roles today didntwe i used to be the one wishing you would calm down uh huh sirius said slumping further into his seat sirius are you ok yeah candy eat the candy i do this to my friends when they are

summer james asked good sirius said good i repeated oh well my mum took me to remus got weird looks from the rest of us oh good fine er good peter said and how about you james i said figuring that was why he asked us in the first place oh it was magnificent blah blah blah i honestly just zoned him out think charlie brown teacher please let us get to hogwarts faster 888888888888888888888888 i was walking down the corridor on my way to transfiguration in the middle of october with my mind completely on the subject ahead of me i realized i had more time than i originally thought i had to get to class so i slowed my pace down hey i head a voice whisper and i jerked my head to the left right as someone grabbed me by the arm and pulled me behind a corner i panicked and struggled for a second until i realized it was only sirius still with pink hair amazingly i relaxed what the i began but sirius covered my mouth with his hand so i couldntcontinue shhh look over there james is about to do your dare he whispered and then let go of my mouth i looked over to where sirius had motioned and had to suppress a giggle james was talking to a very aggravated looking lily i couldnthear exactly what james was saying to her but i figured if sirius was right he was asking her out james sighed and looked at the floor and muttered something to lily and she turned on her heel and left i shot sirius a questioning look and he just shrugged and walked around the corner to his best mate i didntfollow incase james threw some sort of temper insensitive of me i know i watched as james made another sort of sigh and said something in a melancholy manner then shrugged and left in the opposite direction lily walked off in i finally came out i walked over to sirius before i could even ask he said apparently lily already has a boyfriend i looked at the floor feeling guilt rush over me oh i said softly is he ok he ll get over it he always does we d better get going or we ll be late what subject do you have next transfiguration you charms we are heading different directions see you around yeah see you i said and we walked in opposite directions since when did he get so mature sounding he no longer acted immature around me i wasntsure if i liked it or not the old sirius was so much more fun what happened i was caught in the same thoughts after classes ended for the day when i caught james out of the corner of my eye walking with remus back to the gryffindor common room i quickly ran up to them james he turned at my call oh hi autumn just autumn what happened to we must always call you fall girl james blinked obviously not amused ooookaayyy never mind um i just wanted to er i really sorry for making you ask lily out i honestly didntthink i didntask her because you told me to oh okay then never mind i guess i sorry about lily though yeah i nodded once slowly uncomfortable at the situation and left oh wait i said turning back and running back to james and remus yes good luck in your quidditch game tomorrow this seemed to get james and he finally smiled i could see remus smiling too obviously glad james was in a better mood thanks james said i ll be there cheering you on james smile widened and feeling i had cheered him up i turned and left to my own common room 20 chapters i must be a real nerd oh well everyone thought i was a complete freak because i walked

rejects swing swing 888888888888888888888888 did you hear it supposed to be big you think he ll ask you what does formal mean exactly do you think i pushed my way through the crowd surrounding around the slytherin notice board i looked up at the bright orange coloured notice halloween ball soon when october 31st from 8pm to 12 midnight what to wear no costume required formal who invited 4th years and up only unless invited happy halloween i smiled i loved seeing people looking formal it makes everyone seem mature ew that word again not to worry no one completely matures at 14 i struggled my way out of the slytherin crowd and breathed i had woken up really early that morning and there were still a few hours until the first quidditch match of the term gryffindor against slytherin i almost laughed out loud as i saw callaway jumping up and down holding hands with her friend shrieking because some idiot boy asked her to the ball already honestly who would want to go with someone like that trying to contain my laughter i walked out of the common room and wondered what to do it was saturday halloween was in two weeks and i had finished all my homework for the weekend when in doubt go to the library i walked quickly down the corridor as if i had somewhere important to go i stopped by the library and entered no longer walking quickly i looked around for a moment as if a book would come to me as i stood there as we were studying the properties of moonstone in potions i picked up a book on the subject randomly and sat down in the table in the back of the library and read it was only about a half hour later when someone tapped me on the shoulder that i realized i hadntsoaked in any information at all i turned and saw remus smiling down at me whatcha reading there something on moonstones sit please i said motioning towards the seat across from me at the table homework no i was just really really bored remus laughed i shrugged smiling hey erm are you he trailed off do i what never mind i forgot i laughed going to the quidditch match yeah and i know you are remus said yeah i going to be cheering gryffindor on so i ll be standing in the gryffindor section you think that allowed of course it is as long as you dontchange the badge on your robes you can wear gryffindor coloured scarves hats and stuff oh good what time is it almost 9 oh then we should probably head down to the pitch huh sure remus stared at me as if waiting for me to do something er right let go i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and stood up to leave with remus following the quidditch stands were filling up as students were piling in waiting for the first game of the year over there it where we usually sit remus said pointing to sirius who waved with a jovial grin i grinned back i love people being in a good mood we weaved through the crowd and got to sirius who was saving three seats near him remus and i sat and i looked around at the various people filling into the stands across from us was the house i should have been supporting and to the left and right were hufflepuff and ravenclaw rooting on either gryffindor or slytherin after a few minutes of waiting we finally heard the commentator boom welcome to the first quidditch match of the year cheers exploded across the stadium as the commentator yelled today match is gryffindor against slytherin more cheers rippled through the stadium the commentator called off the gryffindor team names and they came zooming into view along with cheers from the scarlet and gold and boos from the green and silver the slytherin team was called next and they zoomed onto the pitch with boos and cheers as well the game started and gryffindor got a head start by scoring the first goal i felt a shiver run up my spine and i realized that i was standing outside in the middle of october with just my school uniform i felt something drape over my shoulder and i looked up and saw remus putting a gryffindor scarf around my neck i smiled in thanks it was too loud to say a proper thank you he yelled over the crowd cheers you can keep it what the scarf you can keep it oh thanks i fingered the scarf around me and my smile widened 8888888888888888888888888 turn the bloody music down i heard a prefect yell across the party in the gryffindor tower i d been invited to and dragged to a gryffindor party after they won the first quidditch match of the year i was sitting on a scarlet couch watching the party from a distance with my head resting on both hands smiling i watched as james was trying to say something to lily only succeeding in annoying her to death and having her leave he just shrugged as if he were used to it and walked over to sirius who was waving his wand grinning suddenly the music seemed to go from loud to blazing your ears out loud everyone slammed their hands against their ears as james and sirius both started rolling on the floor probably laughing but i couldnthear they didntseem to have to hold their ears i walked over to them with my hand clasped tightly over my ears i yelled something but i figured they couldnthear me so i just kicked sirius in the side as hard as i could i saw sirius mouth the word ow and he sat up and hunched his shoulders waving his wand again the music went back to it normal loud hey what was that for it wasnteven very creative why d you kick me sirius asked innocently i rolled my eyes you needed it and you couldnthear me answer my question right well see if you blare the music then the fragile boys and girls will leave and we ll be left with just the sluts you re despicable james and him both gave proud smiles as if i just complimented them well then i guess i ll just be fragile today wonti wa i heard as i stomped out of the their common room once

grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go so make the best of this test and dontask why it not a question but a lesson learned in time it something unpredictable but in the end is right i hope you had the time of your life so take the photographs and still frames in your mind hang them on a shelf in good health and good time tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial for what it worth it was worth all the while green day the time of your life the halloween ball was that sunday night and tomorrow saturday we had a hogsmead trip to get what we needed for it i changed out of my pajamas and into casual clothes while wondering if i would need to get anything for the ball at all i wondered if i was going at all i sighed and headed down for breakfast putting my hair in a high ponytail entering the great hall i laughed as i saw sirius trying to spike remus hair with his wand from behind him remus swiped sirius away and laughed as he smoothened out his hair with his wand i walked over to the slytherin table as usual and finished my breakfast as quickly as i could trying to choke yourself i swallowed and looked up to face remus who was looking rather amused maybe he rolled his eyes so he sat across from me are you going to the halloween ball i shrugged i dunno er do you maybe want to go with me he said looking down i smiled at his bashfulness sure he looked up grinning great so then i ll meet you by the slytherin common room at 7 50 on halloween okay i said grinning okay then er bye i forced myself not to laugh as he returned back to the gryffindor table i saw sirius ask remus something and remus just shrugged and went back to finishing his breakfast i smiled again and finished my own breakfast 8888888888888888888888 the hogsmead trip was that day and i finally knew that i would in fact need to buy a dress for the halloween ball i not exactly the kind of person who just picks something out in a store and buys it it takes me a while for this particular dress though it took around 3 hours yes just for the dress i settled on a navy blue dress that came down to my ankles and sleeves that drooped off my shoulders i paid for it and left the store feeling both accomplished and like i had just wasted a few hours hmmm is it possible to feel both at once well it is now i spotted all four marauders heading for zonko s i grinned go figure huh hey wait up i called as i caught up with them they all turned in my direction and stopped to wait for me to reach them i pointed with my thumb to zonko s you need more i swear both james and sirius broke into identical grins can never have too much of anything from zonko s never ever james added to sirius comment never ever ever i said mockingly sirius ignored my sarcasm and said exactly i rolled my eyes remus eyes my bag then looked up at me with the slightest smile dress i nodded you re going to the ball james asked laughing you picked some random bum off the street to go with you remus blushed and i laughed you are so mean to your friends tsk tsk you should treat them better i laughed and remus turned a darker red looking at the floor what that supposed to mean sirius asked oblivious to the whole situation ignoring his question i said well best be going i have a few more things to get have fun buying well whatever you boys buy in there i said pointing lazily towards the store hey we are not boys we are men james said standing straight i snorted turned and left the trip was almost over and we d be going back to the castle soon so i decided to grab a quick butterbeer before i left there no drink quite like a butterbeer i caught up with the marauders and their many zonko shopping bags before we all had to go back to the castle you boys are terrifying you know that i said eyeing the zonko products hidden within many bags men fall girl men james said teasingly yes we are terrifying arentwe sirius said giving me a very mischievous grin just your face sirius i laughed sirius pretended to look offended and put a hand to his chest in a very girly manner my face that just not possible is patricia thompson obviously doesntthink so sirius said smiling james snorted and covered his face with his hand and bent over slightly what sirius asked james who looked like he was shaking in silent laughter thompson is the ugliest female in hogwarts james laughed hey sirius shouted resenting it i disagree i think she pretty i think you re just jealous because lily turned you down and you had to go with a slutty clingy girl instead peter said out of the blue james looked at him in shock look who talking rat boy you donthave a date at all do you well no but exactly james sniffed patricia is much prettier than that samantha mccoy whatever you want to think mate because you know i right sirius said not wanting to give up will you two shut up i snapped impatiently why are you so angry because you secretly couldntfind a date so you made up dome random guy sirius asked i was silent wait you really didnt get a date did you you dontknow i asked curiously know what who i going with no am i supposed to no i guess not i said not looking at remus would you like to know no not really actually fine then fine fine james yelled loudly and started cracking up i stared at him what the hec i said to the laughing james after james regained composure he shrugged it was funny erm sure prongs sirius said looking at james as if he were a crazed lunatic 888888888888888888 marauders pov james came out of the bathroom and sat on his bed and joined the conversation the other marauders were having speaking of which who is autumn going with no one was talking about anything close to the ball sirius remus said with a knowing smile well yes but but you dontwant to admit that you secretly wanted to go to the ball with fall girl james said grinning what trisha is much much nicer and prettier than autumn she only nice to you and i not sure which patricia you are talking about but the one i talking about isn t dontfinish that sentence prongs james only laughed and held up a hand in defeat would you have remus asked nervously would i have what sirius asked would you have gone to the ball with autumn if she werenttaken i well i was planning on asking her in the beginning of our hogsmead trip james gave a huge grin as a friend sirius reassured him sure james said not giving up so that why you picked thompson at the last minute no well i had togo to the ball right sirius fancies auuuutummn peter teased shut up i do not if i fancied anyone you guys would be the first to know you all know that yeah mate we re just having fun and making your life a living hell you know that james said teasingly sirius scowled at him james you you re and idiot ha you cantthink of anything to say i going to bed sirius said and went under the covers sirius going to bed first well that new james teased and sirius groaned too tired to say anything in defense and slowly fell asleep to the sound of his friends pointless babble 8888888888888888888888 i woke the next morning completely unaware of the date i only just figured out it was halloween day when i entered the creepy looking great hall there were bats that zoomed around randomly and jack o lanterns that hovered in mid air spider webs were scattered more than usual in the corners and there were orange and black tapestries hung to the sides of the hogwarts crest engraved into the wall behind the staff table i gawked at the decorations as i slowly walked to the slytherin table i took a quick glance at the gryffindor table as i usually did and spotted all four marauders looking like they had just come out of cracking some stupid joke lily who was seated a few seats over from the marauders met my glance and set her fork down to quickly stand up she walked over to me and i stopped walking towards the slytherin table hi she said optimistically um hi i said nervously in return a n people dontworry lily isntgoing to ask autumn to the ball lol i thought maybe oh but first are you going to the ball er yes oh good a few of my friends and i are going to get together tonight and do each other make up and stuff for the ball and i thought maybe you wanted to come along i smiled in the gryffindor common room well naturally yes lily said nervously if if it ok with your friends i d love to i grinned great we ll meet you in front of the great hall at 6 and we ll take you to the gryffindor common room as i doubt you remember exactly how to get there i nodded thank you i said honestly it nothing really oh and before hand the blonde is karli elliott and the brunette is bonnie cox er you donthave to remember but i just thought you might want to know um yeah thanks lily smiled turned and walked back to the gryffindor table the offer was so weird but it was one of those offers that you didntask where it came from you just accepted it i finished my breakfast with a small smile and a knowing that later that night i would experience something new ooooo what does this button do haha a page break i learned something new today i feel special yup erm to more sirius issues sorry

6 string darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as i stared i counted the webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason will you come home and stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight i miss you blink 182 i finished my breakfast with a small smile and a knowing that later that night i would experience something new 88888888888888888 all day i was eagerly waiting for the halloween ball that night i constantly went back to the slytherin common room to make sure my dress was still just as pretty as it was the last time i saw it paranoid i know but being this eager does things to one mind finally it was time to meet lily and her friends at the great hall i got together my dress and the amount of make up i owned which wasntmuch and walked quickly to the great hall entrance sure enough a redhead blonde and brunette stood talking where they said they would meet me i grinned and walked up to them lily was the first to turn to me oh hi you re a few minutes early um this is karli elliott she said gesturing towards the blonde haired girl and this is bonnie cox she said motioning towards the brunette girl next to karli i nodded shyly and they both gave a polite hi and hey well let go to gryffindor huh lily said and led towards her common room 8888888888888888 you know this is really nice of you i said coming out of the bathroom after changing into my midnight blue silk dress lily smiled and said that dress looks really good on you oh thank you i said my cheeks turning pink she right it does karli said and bonnie looked away from the mirror she was looking into yeah it does i turned a deeper shade of pink and replied well that not fair because i cantsay the same about any of you until you put your dresses on i smiled lily you can go next if you want i said smiling dontask me why they cantjust change in front of each other it just like that ok haha eventually we were all changed into our dresses and lily came to me with an evil look on her face and make up in her hands oh no ahhhhh attack of the girl with the make up the attack turned out not so bad it seemed as if all my features were outlined it was weird and yet pretty i guess where did you learn to apply make up so well lily oh well bonnie over there is always dragged into these huge fancy parties by her parents and naturally she had to invite karli and i every time and the parties are like i said very fancy and they expect us to get all fancied up i suppose so eventually we all learned how to do our make up it comes in handy lily grinned then went and applied her own make up and bonnie and karli did the same i walked over to an open book on one of their beds and scanned a page wow it a whole book full of hairstyles i ve never seen a wizarding one lily laughed and replied neither had i until bonnie bought this she said putting the finishing touches on her make up and walking over to where i was standing she picked up the book and handed it to me it give a whole load of spells to change your hairstyle easily without hairspray or anything just add clips she said dramatically pretty amazing for a muggle born if i do say so hey i said defensively what i one too you are oh right you are arentyou lily nodded pick one out then i flipped through the book and eventually decided on a hairstyle that would put my hair up completely except a few stands of waved hair around my face the back was put up high and curled loosely to come down to my neck i placed the charm on my hair and walked over to the things i brought and placed on the side of a dresser i shifted aside a few things and took out a barrette and necklace the barrette had dark blue crystals in rows all over it the necklace was a simple deep blue crystal heart the necklace was my mothers and the barrette i had picked up to go with the dress when i bought it a n the links for examples of the jewelry is in my profile i placed the barrette near when my hair all gathered at the back of my head and i put the necklace on ahhh spider i looked at myself in the mirror and smiled 8888888888888 are you guys ready yet lily said annoyed to her two best friends as i stood waiting with her we re going to be late if you two donthurry up i laughed are they always like this yes i have to wake them up every morning just so they wontbe late for classes it ridiculous i smiled ok i ready bonnie exclaimed coming out of the bathroom dramatically and i ready too just a sec karli said putting another dab of something on her face then looking to us from the mirror there i told remus i would meet him in front of slytherin you re going with remus lily said surprised um yes i am is that bad i said nervously no no i just thought you were going with never mind lily said with a knowing smile with who what nothing nothing well i meeting ben anderson in front of gryffindor as he is a ravenclaw and bonnie and karli both have dates from hufflepuff so they re going with me oh ok well let all walk out together then yes ok lily said and we all walked out of the girls dorm together we walked up to the inside of the entrance thanks again this was really fun i said honestly no problem it was really fun we should do this for the next ball lily said yeah it was great karli said and bonnie nodded right well i got cut off by a guy voice from behind us you girls stand there and talk any longer and you ll get hit by the portrait we all turned to see three marauders poor peter walking down from the boys dorm remus smiled at me and i smiled back hey isntit supposed to be the other way around i asked sirius as they walked towards us what do you mean the other way around sirius asked as if he already knew the answer well usually the boys are standing waiting for the girls to come down looking all ravishing and impress the boys who are standing there about to get hit by the portrait i said smiling first off we re men fall girl when will you understand that insert girls snorting second off we wouldntbe standing near the portrait and third off thirdly whatever are you calling us ravishing and impressing james said with his mischievous grin you wish although all three of you do clean up nicely i said teasingly you bet we do we re the marauders sirius said posing get a theme song and get over yourself i said trying not to laugh at his very girlish pose not a bad idea actually lily you re looking amazing as usual james said to lily like autumn said get over yourself lily said putting her hands on her hips besides dontyou have a date yes i do but she cantcompare to you can she james said grinning lily just rolled her eyes and ignored his comment so what are you doing here remus asked finally speaking up saving you the trouble of walking all the way to slytherin i answered still smiling saving him the is autumn your date sirius asked remus i answered for him way to put two things together it a miracle you can walk and talk at the same time i can roll over too sirius said and i blinked not getting it so why didnteither of you tell us you were going together he said mainly asking remus i guess we thought it wasnta big deal remus said looking at his feet yes but oh that why you asked me last night whether i wa sirius trailed off remus nodded obviously understanding something i didn t yeah wow and even though you knew i would have you still didnttell me um forgive me remus asked pathetically yeah but only cause you re a marauder sirius said twice as pathetically thanks mate uh huh well that was touching but you re all keeping your dates waiting i said with my arms crossed right james said and started walking towards the portrait hole with sirius following but right before sirius left he looked down at me with a weird look that i had never seen him have before it was weird it was three times as pathetic poor thing probably wants me to save him from the slut he going to have to dance with all night haha his problem but for some reason the look he gave me made my stomach squirm and it made me feel like crying the feeling lingered there for a few seconds after they all left and i took a deep breath and looked up at remus you ok yes i fine then i switched modes and perked up come young man will you escort a lady remus laughed yes i will flashbacks why thank you young man will you escort a lady no no why no because no because why no because because come on because you are in slytherin and i would be killed if i was found walking you to your common room he finally said flat out will you escort a lady yes ma am sirius walked over to autumn and all formal like linked his arm with hers end flashbacks i ve used that line a few times now remus gave me a side glance because he probably only knew of once that i used that line and just kept walking with me towards the great hall once in the great hall i looked around at the brilliant decorations the prefects had managed this year everything from creepy to spookily elegant i looked at remus and made eye contact with him long enough to smile at him then turn to look at the other people at the ball that night we sat and snacked on the small amount of food they had placed on the table and punch eventually lily her boyfriend karli bonnie sirius and james came through the doors to the great hall james spotted us and motioned for sirius and the others to follow him as he came to where we were sitting they all squished in and sat either next to us or across the table from us i turned and faced the inside of the table so i could see the others you two are such a drag you ve been sitting here this whole time james asked remus and i um yes i replied nervously i ll show you how a man parties sirius said giving his i m about to break a school rule grin sirius pulled out his wand reached over the table and pointed his wand and mumbled some charm at the punch bowl then sat back down what did you do i asked sirius sirius just smiled and said would you like some punch and then he winked i rolled my eyes and muttered prat i heard that sirius said from across the table good it ll deflate the ego that presently takes up all the space in your head oooo that a bit mean for a little girl like you to come up with it not mean enough for a man like you finally you admit it shut up i was being sarcastic only because it so hard for you to admit your undying love for me my temper began to rise and i stood a bit from my seat to lean over the table a bit undying love to a black i think not the only undying love you ll ever get is from your mother oh wait no she doesntlove you either i said in a harsh tone my cheeks starting to redden from anger shut up you little bitch sirius said standing up out of the corner of my eye i saw james sigh and smack his forehead with the palm of his hand i stood up why dontyou just shove it up your autumn remus said cutting me off would you like to dance at first i glared at him as if i were arguing with him but i then sighed and sat down trying to calm myself sure i said and got off the table seat i saw sirius stubbornly sit down and james smacked him in the back of the head and asked his date to dance also most of the partners stood up also except sirius who stubbornly at with his date not saying anything we reached the dance floor and a slow song started up i blushed slightly and put my arms around his neck as casually as i could remus did the same to my waist i gave him an awkward smile dontworry about sirius he can be a real pain sometimes tell me about it he such a such a jerk remus nodded it true he can be but he a great guy most of the time i sniffed and i shouldntbe telling you this but he originally wanted to ask you to this ball i looked at him shocked why did he change his mind i beat him to it he smiled he was planning on asking me the day before the ball apparently at hogsmead but he did say that he just wanted to ask you asa friend but what remus smile widened nothing it just he never been more secretive about anything than he has about you and james peter and i all agree that that is a bit unusual for him not to talk a lot about girls that is yeah i said looking in the direction sirius was and saw that he was no longer there but his date was is sirius going out with her i asked remus motioning towards sirius date remus shook his head i dontthink so where is sirius probably outside how do you know that when he gets angry he likes to go outside to cool off that just how he is oh we danced a little more until the song ended and i looked at remus and asked do you think do you think i could go look for him remus gave a knowing smile go ahead me again and i learned how to use to page break button for my last chapter so i used it go me um a lot of chapters next chapter we ll have a heated discussion between sirius and autumn that i ve been planning for months and i so glad i ll finally write it school is

too besides she just insulted the love of my mother ah well it true that she doesntlove me anyways but it not like she had to yell it in my face i felt tricia tug on the robes on my arm but i ignored her she obviously wanted to dance as everyone else had gone to the dance floor but i wasntmuch in the mood to dance at the moment i heaved a sigh i needed to cool down hey tricia i going to go outside for a moment i ll be right back i said as politely as i could muster yeah ok she said looking disappointed i quickly walked outside and onto a path it was pretty disgusting how the bushes were moving and talking so i decided to move much farther away until i found a bench by a large tree sound familiar no ok never mind i sat and leaned my forehead onto my hand and tried to collect my thoughts the discussion autumn and i had inside was much louder and more intense than it should have been it started out very innocent speaking of innocent what ever happened to that black haired short 1st year girl that was so shy that she couldnteven speak her mind autumn sure grew up all right and now she was a 14 year old girl who wasntafraid to speak her mind at all in fact i wish she still were afraid to speak her mind she was rather annoying now but did i mention i love the navy blue dress she wearing tonight no well i do donttell i heard the clicking of high heels walking down the path and i looked up thinking it was autumn coming to find me but to my surprise it was tricia i nearly groaned out loud james was right she is a total slut tricia came and sat next to me on the bench and put a hand on my back hi sirius are you ok yeah trish i fine i said sounding bored oh good i was worried about you i almost snorted but i kept my silence sirius i was thinking well that new i think we should be together uhhhh tricia could see my hesitation so she leaned over in one swift motion and kissed me full on i was too shocked to move so i just sat there for a few seconds before i heard what the hell remus said you two werentgoing out i broke away from the clingy slut cough i meaaaan patricia and faced autumn who had a look of confusion anger and maybe a slight bit of jealously ha i knew she was madly in love with me no one can resist me no one we re not i answered yet patricia added i gave her a sharp look really well that just great have fun being you autumn said to me in a very cold tone then turned to leave wait um tricia could you let us talk alone for a few minutes patricia shrugged and walked back inside what do you want autumn said equally as cold as before but less tense because she wasntaround patricia why are you acting so cold recently i asked simply cold ha you have no idea what me being cold is like autumn said with a slight glare what are you what are you talking about why are you being so bitchy that not exactly what you call someone if you want them to stop being mean to you autumn said stubbornly and then turned to leave again i stood up and grabbed her arm to prevent her from going any further what autumn yelled suddenly i was so shocked that i let go of her arm quickly autumn turned back to me and yelled why do you have to be like that you donteven care do you donteven look who talking have you for a second in the past year thought about anyone but yourself have you thought about how the smallest things you say can really hurt yeah big surprise amazingly i have feelings too weird huh and dontyou dare try to say sorry about yelling my personal life to the whole damn great hall dontworry i wasntgoing to apologize to you good i dontwant your apologizes no you want my apologizes you just don t deserve them autumn said sharply and what do you deserve then what would make you happy at this moment i said stepping closer to her for effect for you not to lead me on and then forget it all what re you lead you on what the hell you wish i was leading you on you are so full of yourself sometimes do you know that i paused waiting for her to say something but when she didn t i continued you really have no idea do you i asked no idea about what exactly autumn asked with her hands on her hips you re so thick you just dontcare what other people think or feel you just care about what happens to you what makes you happy right and you donttake five seconds just to look around you and see what really going on or what really happening you live in your world you re so clueless autumn you really are just a selfish slytherin bitch arentyou i could see i had really gotten to autumn now she stared at me for a few seconds before she hesitantly replied why do you always compare me to slytherins so do you consider all slytherins like that selfish yeah yeah actually i do autumn seemed to muster up all her pride and burst out well i agree autumn finally snapped under the pressure and turned in one swift swish and started walking quickly back to the castle i yelled after her stubbornly you just canthandle the pressure can you you dont want to understand you just canthandle the facts i paused for effect stupid mudblood slytherin it worked autumn stopped completely in her tracks and seemed to soak in what i just said autumn pov stupid mudblood slytherin sirius finished i stopped walking abruptly and let what he said sink in i looked over my shoulder at sirius who was just standing there glaring at me in all his confidence i closed my eyes and faced forward again and started walking at a much faster speed i sped through great hall and went around the people dancing and passed the tables that remus james and their dates were sitting as i walked past remus stood up to follow me but james grabbed his arm and dragged him in the direction i had just come from i made my way as quickly as i could in a dress barely aware of where i was going once i came to the slytherin common room i choked the password and walked straight into the girls dorm and into the bathroom ignoring the younger students that werentallowed to attend the ball i locked myself in the bathroom put a silencing charm around the room and slumped against the door with my face in both of my hands crying the loss of any self confidence i once owned 888888888888888888 i watched as they carried the empty coffin down the line i buried my face in my hands i couldntwatch it anymore i felt a hand on my shoulder but i shrugged it off it felt like nothing mattered anymore like nothing would ever matter anymore i heard someone start talking in a low droning voice but i didntpay attention to it the funeral eventually ended and i walked away with a depressing cloud hanging over me and my father he was quiet as we walked back to the car and i didntcomplain in fact if anyone happened to talk to me at that moment i wouldntknow i was in my own little world at the moment we got home and i went inside and walked into my room to sit on my bed and think i lay down with my face in both of my hands and mourned the loss of my mother 8888888888888 autumn i heard a muffled voice say from outside of the bathroom door it was now much past the time when the ball had finished and i still hadntleft the slytherin bathroom i was sitting in with my back against the door i had stopped crying about an hour ago but i hadntmoved at all since then i completely ignored the voice that was calling me figuring it was sirius autumn i recognized that voice to be not sirius but james go away james you arentsuppose to be here i said my voice cracking from lack of use when i didnthear an answer i figured he left but then realized i had put a silence charm around the room i stood up turned around and unlocked and opened the door to face james leaning against the wall next to the bathroom hi james i said avoiding his eye contact by looking at the floor you ok he said carefully yeah james i fine i was just getting away from black is all black i shrugged autumn you sure dontlook ok to me first off your eyes are all squinty and puffy second you just called the person you used to fancy black third i ve never fancied black james game me a small smile and raised his eyebrows obviously not believing me the least bit right anyways after you left remus and i went to find sirius and he called a marauder meeting do you have any idea what that means not really i said acting like i didntcare the last and only time we had a marauder meeting was when we found out remus was a well you know i shrugged so anyways all he did the whole meeting was complain about well you he told peter remus and i to swear not to talk to you and go back to calling you vilcent i sniffed but we didn t autumn we cantleave you you know that sirius is just being stubborn he never even told us what you two said to each other what did you two say to each other i sighed he blew up at me when i was trying to apologize to him about yelling at him earlier and before i left he called me a stupid slytherin and a a mudblood he didnt he did merlin james said smacking his forehead the hardest he had all that night he turning into his bloody family what an idiot i smiled at his protectiveness over me and i let a tear slip out that i had been holding in since i began talking to james james stopped insulting his best mate and reached over and wiped the tear before i could get to it autumn none of us think that sirius is just a little well dontworry i ll beat some sense into him if i have to i laughed you re great james i said and i hugged him needing the comfort you re amazing fall girl james the super hero lol i really have to go to

marauder pov you know you should apologize to her james said for the millionth time that night and sirius pressed his pillow tighter to his ear and muttered sleepily shut up james it not your business he took the pillow off his ear sat up from bed and faced james bed which was next to his sirius is on the far left side if you are facing them from the foot of the beds and then to the right is james to the right of james is remus and to the right of remus is peter does that make sense it is my business sirius autumn has become like the little sister i never had to me i have this weird fatherly brotherly protectiveness for her well that makes sense siblings and parents are always annoying james sat up autumn is not annoying you re just too thick headed to notice thick headed look whose talking always chasing a girl you will never have a chance with hey will you two shut up remus yelled from his bed sirius and james steamed and sirius flung the covers off himself and stormed out of the dorm wait sirius don t bloody hell i dead james expression changing to a worried one james too flung his covers off and followed sirius behind them remus groaned and stuck his face in the pillow trying to sleep over the racket autumn pov i stared into the flames of the fireplace and sat up on the couch taking the blanket off me i heard someone talking loudly in the dorm and i ignored it as i made out different shapes in the fire not feeling sleepy at all let see well there a leaf and a raindrop so let see according to my divination teacher i would probably die a horrible death by plugging my nose and opening my mouth to the rain and drown myself to death and there would be a leaf i dontknow how a leaf would kill me maybe it an evil mutated leaf yeah that it evil mutated leaves so i going to drown to death in the rain and there will be evil mutated leaves dancing around my feet sure why not i sighed i would make a horrible muggle psychologist i heard stomping to my left but i didntbother to turn what the hell i jerked my head to where the voice was coming from and immediately stood up and faced sirius you i started to say angrily but sirius cut me off what are you doing here gryffindor doesntbelong to you does it i said fuming it belongs to me more than it belongs to you sirius said stubbornly i saw james come in behind sirius he put a hand on sirius shoulder i brought her in here sirius sirius turned on james so what happened to lily so suddenly you re sleeping with autumn a n dontworry people no body is sleeping with anybody james rolled his eyes and sighed dontbe immature sirius she wasntfeeling good because of you still here i said impatiently and i wasntfeeling bad because of him i lied stubbornly did i break your hearrrt sirius said still being immature you re such a jerk black well you re a bitch autumn sirius really stop being stupid or you ll regret it james said as calmly as he could manage stay out of it sirius yelled at james as i glared at sirius james sniffed and joked make me sirius made a fist and i took a step forward siri notice she almost called him sirius sirius punched james in the stomach james staggered back what the he just punched his best mate james took a breath and ran and tackled sirius to the floor in an all out punching marathon i squeaked oh my gosh ja sir uhhhh p petrificus totalus i said as the first thing that came to my head as i pointed my wand at both of them hitting james he became suddenly rigid and sirius pushed james off himself ah uh s s sorry sirius suddenly seemed calm he sat cross legged on the floor and put his forehead in his hand which was propped up with his elbow against his knee he sighed and didntspeak at all the awkward silence was really really uncomfortable after about 10 seconds i got up my courage and walked over to around 4 feet from him and sat down on the floor facing him sirius exactly what did i do to make you angry i asked as nicely as i could when sirius didntanswer i tried again sirius are you ok sirius took a deep breath and looked up at me i noticed the faintest trace of a tear in his eye i an idiot he looked at me in the eyes and i shifted my gaze to the floor you re not sirius stood up i looked up at his tall figure autumn just leave me alone ok i was taken aback i thought he was going to apologize sure but sirius i really sorry for whatever it was i did to cause you to hate me like this i miss when all of us had fun together there was another awkward silence which i broke by leaving the gryffindor common room making sure to bring james back to consciousness first 888888888888888888 third person pov month after month flew by without autumn talking to sirius at all as james was sirius best mate he had to side with him but that didntprevent him from talking to autumn here and there remus felt horribly guilty about the whole situation because he felt that if he would have let sirius ask autumn to the ball first none of this would have happened and as much as any of them told remus he was wrong remus still wouldntforgive himself lily karli and bonnie all grew slightly closer but autumn had and will always be closer to lily than she was to either of lily friends before any of them knew it it was christmas vacation hey fall girl going home for christmas autumn was walking to her potions class and turned around to see james walking faster to catch up to her she waited for him and said no of course not as if it were an obvious thing oh well you can always come over to my place again james suggested oh autumn let a slight blush fill into her cheeks um well sirius wontbug you i swear he ll just probably steer clear of you james pleaded and autumn heaved a sigh yeah well i ll think about it ok sure but make sure you think hard about it james joked autumn chuckled i will prooooomiiiise promise autumn grinned at the innocence of him right well bye fall girl autumn would never get tired of that nickname she smiled good luck in that game tomorrow i ll be cheering you on and with that she walked to her class right on time 88888888888888 no and stop asking i only asked once autumn lily said looking at autumn with a tilted head lily and autumn were sitting against a tree talking about random stuff and of course the first think lily asked autumn was are you going home for christmas well i either staying here or going to james house potter that prat are you seriously friends with him well yeah i mean once you get to know him he actually really nice ooooooo do you like james autumn cringed ew ew ew no he like the protective older brother i never had uh huh sure you re only saying i like him to cover up the fact that you secretly adore him lily blushed slightly potter is my worst nightmare why would i like him i mean i donteven consider him a friend riiiiiight well speak of the tsk tsk should you really be finishing that sentence evans lily sniffed and autumn giggled knowingly autumn looked behind james to see sirius looking at the floor autumn had never seen sirius be this un talkative for this long of a time it made her feel really horrible inside well fall girl have you been thinking about it yes have you been thinking about it really really hard sure and have you come to a decision maybe um ok so what is it lily looked at james and autumn amused at the conversation well the decision was really really hard to come to and james said impatiently and i haventcome to a decision what but calm down james i just kidding is it ok with your parents if i come over this christmas well if it wasn t i wouldntask you well who knows with the marauders one second you are responsible one second you accidentally throw your undergarments out the gryffindor window hey we don t um you didnthappen to find them did you james said looking at the floor that besides the point i ll come over during christmas break yey hug james said with his arms wide autumn blinked twice not moving from her sitting position to james standing position no autumn said plain out awwwwwww so mean james said in a childish manner autumn grinned i ll hug you if you can get your boxers back autumn laughed and pulled a pair of boxers out of her book bag and laughed it was maroon with different quidditch equipment flying all over it autumn immediately stood up and ran with james following close behind i sorry if it was kind of short donthurt me hides from people but i ve been really busy and this is a filler chapter anyways i just had to have autumn go back to james place it was so much fun last time with the food fights and the ghosts and the oh you get it and i have a special plan for sirius muahahahah puppet show time pulls strings sirius walks around and kicks himself in the head for being a jerk and autumn gets all the marauders minus the pudgy git together and huggles them and then the strings get tangles and i fall over the puppet stage and hit my head and pass out so now you know why it ll take me a week or two to get ch 26 up it because i got a concussion yeah go skyhawks i love my high school thank you so much to all the people who helped me calm my nerves about

herself and as got packed for christmas vacation um and the jeans yeah the jeans there nothing left that i not packing for some reason autumn felt awkwardly nervous about spending vacation at james place she felt as if she had to look and act her best she sighed mostly she was nervous to be around sirius who she was still uncomfortable around the last time the two of them had talked sirius was awkwardly silent and then told her to go away after calling himself an idiot heyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ready to go yet autumn jumped and felt her heart start racing dang it james dontscare me like that what if i were indecent james shrugged and autumn laughed hey look everyone it flashback time could i come in came sirius voice no he opened the door i said no what if i was indecent he shrugged and i threw a pillow at him angrily are all the marauders like that james blinked confused like what never mind i ready let go alright james said letting autumn lead the way james looked back hey fall girl missing something autumn shrugged i dontthink so got your toothbrush yeah autumn said stopping got your baggy t shirts um yes how bout your wand autumn smacked her forehead she walked back and picked up her wand from the nightstand now let go already before i forget something else or miss the train right behind you autumn hurried out climbing out of the common room autumn found the rest of the marauders waiting conjuring random things with their wands pinecones bottles shoes etc with the wave of autumn wand all the miscellaneous objects were gone and she hurried them out to the hogwarts express 888888888888888 hey i going to sit with lily and her friends for a while ok autumn told james as she was dragged by the hand by lily yeah have fun james said messing up his hair and talking as if he didntreally hear autumn at all a few seconds later after autumn had gone james walked into the compartment with all the rest of the marauders er wasntautumn here a second ago where d she go sirius remus and peter all managed a chuckle 88888888888888888 yes yes i know i ll be good mother lily lily rolled her eyes as autumn left the compartment she quickly walked down the aisle wanting to get to the marauder compartment she had already changed into her muggle clothing the red turtleneck and the jeans which were the easiest things to get out of her trunk autumn grinned as she came nearer but her grin faded when she saw snape walking towards her with all the confidence she could muster autumn purposely slammed her shoulder into his snape sneered but walked on autumn smiled proud of herself and walked into the compartment the boys were in hello autumn said enthusiastically well hello remus said just as jovially autumn laughed and sat on the floor her back leaning against the wall under the window this is where she learned to be most comfortable while seated with the marauders you donthave to sit on the floor you know remus said yes as a gentleman i offer you my seat autumn smiled as a lady i kindly decline your offer thank you james sat back down without being told twice how much longer til king cross er probably a half hour oh ok there was a tense silence which i had been trying to avoid right james said awkwardly autumn began picking at the carpet below her wow amazing lily and her friends were louder than you lot autumn said playfully well then let be loud can i get a whoooo whoo remus said effortlessly and sirius looked up at james who was now standing and cracked a pitiful smile peter on the other hand squeaked a whhhho autumn laughed nice try thanks james said and sat down in a huff 20 minutes later of mindless dull chatter it doesntmatter to me autumn answered then asked remus we nearly there look out the window remus said anxiously autumn smiled and looked out the window to see the ever familiar train station come into view wow took long enough huh no kidding james answered standing up immediately let gooooo james said impatiently 888888888888888888888 i claim the fridge sirius yelled i claim the pool james yelled i claim the pool after i claim the fridge sirius yelled louder the pool autumn said looking around james house isntit cold i mean it kind of the middle of winter yes the pool the pool is special and there are charms you can put on the pool to make it warm and charms to put on yourself to make yourself warm autumn rolled her eyes and muttered something about normal without even bothering to put his stuff away sirius bolted towards the fridge and before running upstairs to change james said quickly you ve got the same room as last time er right autumn said while side glancing at remus remus laughed and peter walked upstairs to put his stuff away autumn and remus followed autumn put all her stuff away and changed into her swimsuit and shorts as she walked out the door she noticed remus has also put on his swimsuit and a t shirt over it autumn smiled great minds think alike eh yup so are you actually going to go swimming i not sure both autumn and remus headed towards the stairs when they saw sirius coming up with his stuff and a sandwich in the other hand he swallowed his food you two go ahead and head out and go swimming and junk i ll be out there in an hour or so an hour remus asked yeah i mean i have to unpack and fix some things i broke uhhhhhhhhh ok remus said confused autumn shrugged and walked down the stairs and outside to james after remus and herself put a warming charm on themselves amazingly he was actually in the pool hey you re actually in the pool yup james replied enthusiastically come on in you know you want to james said wiggling his eyebrows autumn laughed you re such a ball of energy itttttttttttttttttttt true dontworry the men will come and take you to the squishy room soon autumn said and there was an awkward silence um sorry muggle thing it like an insane institution and you get locked in a room with squishy stuff and a weird jacket never mind autumn stopped talking as she got weird looks from remus and james hey where peter remus asked unnecessarily looking around where do you think he is james said ummmm eating right o autumn laughed again wow james you are acting unusually hyper that because i know something you dontknow what do you know hey kids it flashback time again see if you understand this i calmed down i know something you dontknow that i know about you potter blinked you re weird ah you wouldntsay that if you knew that i know he tilted his head what do you know stuff end flashback i know stuff haha the word stuff is a very funny word stuff stuff stuffing sure james whatever you think autumn said walking over to the pool and sticking her feet in it felt like a hot tub except not quite as warm it is warm weird yup soooo what do you think i know james asked coming closer to autumn um maybe a joke or some stupid prank you are going to pull on me later um not quite buuuut good idea james said and quickly pulled autumn in shorts swimsuit and all autumn came up laughing and shortly after they managed to trick remus in coming in too and peter finally came out after eating and waited a few minutes before getting in himself for hours autumn james remus and peter played random games in the pool renewing their warmth charms every once in a while sirius didntcome out for quite some time but when he finally did autumn found her sense of carelessness suddenly gone hey padfoooootie james yelled to sirius as he came to the pool with dark blue swim trunks on a n whooooooo sirius is in a swimsuit eye candy girls you re finally here join the fun er sirius said and reluctantly got in the pool as autumn got out hey i gonna go grab something to eat i ll be back out though ok autumn said nervously as she headed inside the ever careless james yelled back ok but be quick yeah autumn said walking on but looking over her shoulder to see james grinning at sirius and sirius returning the smile ooooooookkk autumn thought trying to ignore the fact that sirius shouldntbe that cheerful autumn grabbed a pre made sandwich that she inspected a few times before eating you never know with those boys eventually she did go back outside but seeing all of the marauders together being the playful boys that they were made her feel a bit left out and she decided to go back up to her room she finished up the last bit of her sandwich and headed back inside hey fall girl autumn inwardly groaned and turned around to see james in the shallow end of the pool calling for her yeah you going up to your room uhhhh yes autumn said hesitantly thinking they were probably planning some sort of prank in her room kay have fun james grinned and autumn noticed sirius turning away yeah ok autumn said giving him a scared look before turning once again and going inside she knew by the look on james face that he and or the rest of the marauders were planning something either in her room or having to do with her being gone in her room while they set up some stupid prank autumn nervously walked upstairs and to her room she grabbed the doorknob and slowly turned it cautiously opening it she flung the door open not walking in yet and waited when nothing happened she walked inside she sighed nothing had happened autumn jumped right above her bed were gold and maroon letters glittering the words autumn i such

nervously walked upstairs and to her room she grabbed the doorknob and slowly turned it cautiously opening it she flung the door open not walking in yet and waited when nothing happened she walked inside she sighed nothing had happened autumn jumped right above her bed were gold and maroon letters glittering the words autumn i such a jerk 88888888888888888 every time it another line the words fade out and fade in to the next line autumn i such a jerk i sorry i hate apologizing in person i didntmean what i said not any of it did i mention i really bad at this you re as gryffindor as they come to me and so what you re a muggle born i not my family i really regret all that to you i such a jerk this all must sound so cheesy i sorry and now i apologizing for apologizing i pathetic i sorry pleeeeease forgive me if you don t james ll beat me up again but donttell him i said that the words slowly faded and sprinkled onto the bed in the shape of an object at a closer look autumn noticed it was a beanie a n it a hat people in the gryffindor colours autumn choked back a small quiet sob and tears slowly fell down her cheeks she didntmake a move from where she was leaning against the doorframe hey a calm and yet nervous voice said behind her autumn sniffed then smiled and turned around and choked out a hey then not able to help herself she stepped forward and took sirius into a deep hug sirius hugged her back and without speaking they stayed like that for some time ok he has a shirt on people but he still kind of wet cause he was just in the pool muahahaha finally autumn moved away and gave a weary smile i sorry sirius for what for everything for blurting your family life out loud for making you angry for being a stupid slytherin tag along autumn looked at the floor sirius gave a small sarcastic laugh whoever said that since when were you a tag along you re not a tag along and my family life isntall that secret and you still dontknow why i yelled at you so you have no right to apologize to me about something i did wrong autumn just stood there not knowing what to say so sirius wiped a tear off her face with his thumb autumn i should explain see the only reason i snapped like that is because i was already irritated remus he asked you to the ball right autumn nodded softly well i had been planning on asking you before remus so i guess you can say i was jealous as stupid as it sounds autumn smiled i know you were you knew i was going to ask you yeah but only because a little angel told me during the ball sirius laughed was that little angel a hot little angel sirius said teasingly it couldnthave been it wasnt you autumn quipped then grabbed sirius hand and pulled him downstairs was that meant to be an insult autumn only returned a mischievous smile 888888888888888888 so you guys are ok with each other now james asked eyeing us knowingly yes james we arentarguing anymore autumn sighed witswikeweweverfwoght sirius sputtered through his sandwich yes of course sirius we all understood that autumn said sarcastically he said it like we never fought peter said as it was obvious everyone stopped moving and stared at peter as if he was crazy sirius swallowed slowly what wasntit obvious peter asked nervously uhhh james said teasingly scooting away in his chair autumn broke the awkward silence by laughing and soon enough the rest of the table started laughing too there is a lesson here laughing is contageous yes ok yeah i done now after things calmed down autumn stared out the window as the rest of the marauders blabbered about something autumn eyes lit up in excitement and she stood up abruptly it snowing the marauders immediately shut up and looked outside as autumn ran upstairs to get her warm clothes on james and sirius exchanged knowing looks they both bolted upstairs after autumn leaving remus and peter thoroughly left out oy wait up sirius called after autumn as she was already bolting out of her room with layers of clothing on well hurry up then autumn said annoyed and jittery a n do you understand my pen name now after not too long sirius and james ran downstairs to meet remus and peter who were still sitting at the table coming autumn asked them both naw i staying here with remus soon he ll have to deal with peter started but got cut off by james his furry little problem there was a silence until autumn laughed i get it then she went into a less jovial state sorry bout that remus is it tonight no tomorrow night but i still really not in the mood autumn nodded i understand but if you ever want to join us she smiled and led the two other marauders outside to the falling snow while putting a warming charm on herself the boys doing the same there isntenough to have a snowball fight with james complained who said snow is just about fighting with autumn asked smiling uhhhhh nobody right autumn raised an eyebrow sooooo james said as if dying to ask a question so autumn shrugged so are you two and sirius together yet autumn gasped scooped up a small layer of snow packed it walked up to james and smashed it in his face while sirius was laughing autumn giggled and sirius took a breath and said come on james you know i not like that like what am i not good enough for the man slut of the school man ug no i just dontdate two girls at once autumn looked wide eyed at sirius you have a girlfriend uh yeah since a week after the halloween ball thompson the very same ew honestly siriusly hah hilarious autumn said suddenly slightly grumpy so why didnt you ever tell me autumn said turning to james i didntknow james said glaring at sirius what i didntthink you needed to know sirius said defensively well i didnt need to know but sirius i your best mate come on i thought we told each other these things james said angrily autumn sensing obvious tension whipped out her wand and flung snow into both of the boy faces then laughing very hard autumn ran away she ran around the pool and into a little shack that was next to the pool she closed the door behind her and locked it with a spell she heard banging and backed into the small dark shack she stumbled over a pool noodle pool noodles and fell onto an inflatable pool chair pool chairs ow she muttered and james managed to get the door open to pelt her with loads of snow laughing she managed to yell through the heaps of snow ok ok i get it she stood up and shook the snow off her body while james grinned that ll teach you to mess with the marauders he blew on the tip of his wand flipped it around in his fingers and pocketed it swiftly autumn laughed james finally let out his childish excitement ha iwinyoulose he said quickly autumn grinned and scooped up snow in her gloves of course what the first snow without a good first snowball fight with two awesome amazing kind idiotic guys 88888888888888888 autumn finished taking a hot shower dried herself off and put her sleepwear on she heard a knock on her door and she grabbed a comb to brush out her hair as she went to open the door hey james what re you up to autumn asked inviting james in nothing really james said going over and sitting on her bed while slouching his shoulders something bothering you what is it autumn said commenting on james obvious attitude well does it bother you at all that sirius has a girlfriend well not really autumn said half lying you re lying autumn shrugged and said i know it bugging you that he didnttell you yeah it ok that he has a girlfriend that a normal marauder thing autumn rolled her eyes at this but allowed him to go on but i still think he should have told me on a brighter note how was the apology james said suddenly giddy with excitement shocked by the sudden mood swing autumn was silent for a second apolog oooooh that yeah autumn blushed it was good that he apologized awwww fall girl i touched james teased putting a hand to his heart mockingly then reached out and ruffled autumn wet hair she combed her hair out once more and took the opportunity to hide her blush by going and putting her comb away she came back and sat on the bed next to james it was really sweet actually autumn said looking at her palms james looked at her and gave a genuine smile autumn looked up at him and smiled back he mentioned you in his little apology thing did he well he better have as i pressured him to death to apologize what did he say he said he had to apologize or you would beat him up and then he told me not to tell you he said that ah i see james said mock formally and nodded slightly yeah but admit it it bugs you that sirius has a girlfriend autumn just laughed admit it i will never admit that it bugs me autumn said dramatically ha i made you admit it without you knowing it james said pointing an accusing finger at her get out of my room it past your bed time autumn said playfully ah but it my house i can stay up as loooong as i want autumn laughed you re awesome james yeah you re

like a maniac what was that for james asked sirius pushing a very hyper sirius off himself i dontknow you looked like an easy target sirius laughed a sudden voice made them all shut up diagon alley sirius stopped brushing himself off and looked over the fireplace where he just barely saw autumn disappear from the fireplace the marauders all exchanged curious glances and one by one flooed to diagon alley hey fall girl james yelled once in diagon alley and ran to catch up with autumn who was slowly walking towards random stores once he caught up he asked why did you just leave like that i was getting tired of hearing your guys mindless babble so i decided to not wait um ok james analyzed autumn face concerned are you feeling ok what yeah of course autumn said flipping her scarf back

zonko s i have a girlfriend but i going to scream i love you anyways james said flailing his arms above his head and mock ran into the store autumn grinned and motioned for peter and remus who were behind her to follow once inside the store autumn spotted sirius out of the corner of her eye every once in a while zooming past because he had just seen something on a shelf that he liked james zoomed around and came up behind autumn welcome to our second home james whispered and made autumn jump d you know i ve never been inside zonko before all the marauders including sirius stopped in their path and looked at autumn weird what nothing that just a little weird to us look around dontjust stand there like an idiot james said pushing autumn from behind heyyyyyyyyy autumn sirius yelled enthusiastically as james stopped pushing autumn and started grabbing things off shelves yeah autumn said not nearly as giddily i ready to go autumn raised an eyebrow and turned to look at sirius who had four bags full of random zonko products he had already bought in his hands he stood by the door waiting for autumn to come over autumn walked over that was amazingly fast yeah i know but now we have time before the rest of them are done buying their stuff erm time to do what exactly sirius grinned mischievously and pulled autumn by her gloved hand out of the store and jogged down the alley sirius where are we going autumn asked anxiously sirius stopped in front of a well decorated store sirius caught his breath we re going to get you a dress autumn blinked what why would i need a dress for james new years party sirius not to burst your bubble or anything but i was just going to wear the same dress i wore to the halloween ball no no no no no you can t sirius said like a stubborn

sirius stop autumn protested as sirius dragged autumn into a formal dress store i thought guy didntlike dress stores autumn said at an attempt to stop him we don t sirius said grinning uhg i give up autumn said throwing her hands up good sirius said and immediately started looking through the dresses and picked out the skimpiest ones he found when autumn and sirius met in the middle of the store autumn had three and sirius had about fifteen sirius autumn gasped looking at the dresses sirius had picked out yes sirius grinned innocently autumn snatched the dressed from sirius and hung back up about half of them there awwww but i wanted to see you in that tiny little red dress sirius said pouting with his lower lip dontyou have a girlfriend autumn said irritated uhhhh yes sirius said having to think about it autumn rolled her eyes and walked into the dressing room making sure sirius wasntfollowing her like the pervert he was 8888888888888888 sirius you re an idiot why for buying you a dress no for making me let you buy me a dress that i didntneed mmmm but you looked so sexy in that little black dress i bought you sirius said coming up behind autumn and placing his hands on her waist you dontmake it easy for me to be mad at you you re mad at me no of course not autumn said obviously lying wait i confused you re mad at me well no and yes it complicated you wouldntunderstand no i just dontthink i want to know sirius said frowning as autumn looked up at sirius with a concerned expression and for the first time in a very long time sirius looked worried and sincere look they didntdie they heard james yell and sprint at them through his gloves scarves and jacket james lunged and tackled sirius and autumn on the floor ow gerrof autumn said her words muffled james laughed and rolled of the two of them come on you two we re going to get butterbeer james shouted then grabbed autumn hand and ran down the alley once they all got a butterbeer they sat at a table and seemed to calm down a bit so what that you ve got there james asked curiously eyeing the bag autumn had just set down er a dress a dress for the new year party yeah oh james said finishing the conversation because he didntwant to push it yeah autumn said with a bored nod i bored james complained so am i sirius agreed let go do something pointless and annoying james suggested like you asking lily out again autumn joked james frowned insulted asking lily out isntpointless and annoying it point ful and not annoying james protested and autumn laughed suuuure speaking of which sirius said pointing towards the door to the pub lily james yelled and jumped out of his seat to greet lily and one of her friends oh no what are you doing here waiting for you my love james joked right hey autumn autumn grinned and waved to lily and karli and motioned for them to join her and the others brushing james off lily went to join autumn sure ditch me for her james rolled his eyes and went back to the table after many random pick up lines from james lily finally groaned potter i need to talk to you outside lily said annoyed oh really james said raising his eyebrows yes really lily stated and stood up and walked outside with james at her heels autumn laughed as they left he hopeless tell me about it remus laughed and sirius just smacked himself in the forehead and said pathetic they all finished their butterbeers and autumn said well i done think we ought to save james from the wrath of lily evans and then head home sure remus said and then turned to karli it was nice meeting you karli nodded and they all stood up to head out autumn turned towards the door and heard a blood curdling scream in the distance yeah that my lame excuse for a cliff hanger and a chapter i dontreally like this chapter maybe it because i in a bad mood but who knows have any of you noticed autumn mood swings or how at the moment she is kind of more calm then she usually is has anyone noticed that she became that way right after she found out sirius had a girlfriend haha goblet of fire is out in theaters this friday i going to see it on the day it comes out with my friend jucel looking forward to it my birthday is

chapter 29 just a little girl potter i need to talk to you outside lily said annoyed oh really james said raising his eyebrows yes really lily stated and stood up and walked outside with james at her heels autumn laughed as they left he hopeless tell me about it remus laughed and sirius just smacked himself in the forehead and said pathetic they all finished their butterbeers and autumn said well i done think we ought to save james from the wrath of lily evans and then head home sure remus said and then turned to karli it was nice meeting you karli nodded and they all stood up to head out autumn turned towards the door and heard a blood curdling scream in the distance autumn gave a worried side glace to sirius and sirius returned it all of them immediately ran out the door figuring james hexed lily or something as it seemed to be a girls scream autumn looked around the alley and saw people running about with mothers holding their children and running sirius what s autumn started nervously but sirius pointed two figures out in the distance one having bright red hair sirius eyes widened and he turned and told remus karli and peter to get back by floo once they have turned and left sirius turned to autumn it an attack of some sort you go hide and i ll go help james and lily are you insane sometimes yeah sirius sprinted towards the area where he saw lily earlier autumn stayed back for a few seconds then quietly bolted after him james lily sirius called frantically there was no longer any screaming and the alley was deserted other than sirius and autumn sirius suddenly stopped at the corner of an alley that led off of the main road and put his hand over his mouth then turned towards autumn surprised to see she was behind him i thought i told you to stay back sirius said annoyed i thought i told you you are insane sirius grunted then smiled have a look he whispered and pointed to around the corner autumn quietly walked over to where sirius was standing and peered around the corner there she saw lily and james against a wall with her arms wrapped around james and her face buried in his shirt james holding her protectively awwwww autumn whispered then turned to sirius and whispered maybe james jinxed her mmmm maybe sirius said doubtfully and said we should go taunt and humiliate them we no way i ll be cursed into next year by james but you can go right ahead okey dokey sirius said with pride and autumn smacked her forehead they smack their forehead a lot oh well sirius grinning walked around the corner and shouted hello my love birds group hug autumn imagined he had just grabbed them in a bear hug when lily and james didntcomplain autumn got worried she went around the corner to see sirius say hey what wrong we ll explain later james mumbled and walked off in the direction of where the floo fireplace was letting go of lily what happened sirius asked autumn stupidly well there was just an attack use your imagination autumn said and walked off towards lily and james sirius close behind 88888888888888888 autumn found james sitting on the floor with crossed legs looking intently into the flames of the fireplace the night of the day after the attack she walked over and sat next to him not talking for a few seconds and joining him in staring into the fire without looking at him autumn asked how are you feeling james shrugged without answering autumn went on i saw it in the daily prophet death eaters james nodded then turned to autumn why did they come for us what did we do they let everyone else go but they followed us i just don t james trailed off maybe because your parents are aurors and lily is a muggle born yeah maybe did lily and karli go home james nodded again then autumn said softly christmas is in two days i know james answered just as softly not taking his eyes off the fire autumn fiddled with her socks for a while and it was silent until autumn couldnttake it anymore and she lunged at james and hugged him james gave a heart filled laughed and hugged her back james dontever pull a stunt like that again being in the middle of an attack i think i d have a heart attack james smiled and stood up still hugging a clingy autumn and led her to the couch to be more comfortable james lay down on the couch with autumn still wrapped around his neck lying together in a very platonic way d you know it really got me to realize james said comforting autumn with a hand on the higher part of her back that not everyone is nice are are you ok james said straining his neck to look at autumn who was now sobbing into his chest hey maybe you were more affected by this than i was james half joked i it just you scared me so much autumn managed between choked sobs it ok autumn nothing happened to us autumn nodded into james shirt and then slowly fell silent autumn james whispered to autumn and slightly shook her to find she was already fast asleep james smiled at the innocent girl on top of him turned his head and fell asleep himself 888888888888888888888 sirius stumbled out of his room with pajama pants and a white t shirt she scratched his stomach lazily and fumbled to get his legs to take him downstairs for breakfast looking at a clock on the wall by the staircase he realized he had woken up about 6 hours too early for his normal sleeping patterns he had woken up at 7am sirius tripped and fell onto the back of the couch where he looked over the top to get ready to plop on the couch and take a long nap but instead of a welcoming warm cozy couch he found autumn lying on top of james sleeping peacefully sirius frowned and conjured a large bucket of water grumpily sirius lifted the bucket over the pair heads and slowly poured it down their bodies autumn woke up with a jolt and rolled off of james and onto the floor james on the other hand cursed and swatted the bucket away to turn over and attempt to sleep again through being wet what was that why i m confused autumn said putting her palm to her forehead softly and slowly inching towards the burnt out fireplace fiiiiiiire warm autumn said not quite awake yet sirius rolled his eyes and used the wand that was jammed in the side of his pants to dry autumn off and start a fire in the fireplace james was asleep by now and softly snoring and autumn was attempting to warm herself up by the fire ag too late for me to sleep again i too awake sirius grumbled i sorry that must have been a bit awkward for you but i swear it wasntlike how it looked then how in the world did you end up sleeping on top of james see i was crying and you know wait you were crying why it not the point but i hugged him and he helped me and then we sort of fell asleep on the couch sirius said disbelievingly well yeah right sirius said and then fumbled with his hands autumn shot a quick glare at sirius and then went back to warming herself up so autumn said eyeing the gargantuan christmas tree in the corner christmas tomorrow oh yeah sirius said having had forgotten but not too enthusiastic about it just for the record i swear upon hogwarts that james and i have a strictly platonic relationship sirius smiled you re a little girl sirius said randomly um i only a little more than half a year younger than you and that was a little bit random yup guess what else what remus and peter are leaving soon um why remus just wants to go and spend time with his family and peter doesntwant to be alone with just james you and i of course both are coming back for the grand new years party oh did you know you have the most random mood swings ever no not really wow james being asleep is really bugging me it snowing attack the snow and lick the earth beneath our feet at a loss of words autumn just gaped at the randomness of what sirius just said eh what are you waiting for go get your snow clothes on and let go act like little kids in the snow um sirius it been snowing non stop for the past few days so never mind i ll go get warm clothing on yey do you know what else you could do what you could do this sirius said and took out his wand and pointed it at himself and instantly he had on his snow clothing oh right i almost forgot you can do magic here why didntyou remind me before sirius shrugged but flicked his wand at her and they were both ready to head outside do you ever realize how quickly we can get in fights and make up yeah wait we ve gotten in a fight autumn laughed and rolled her eyes and walked outside i now declare this mini snowball fight with vilcent against the handsome black open sirius said enthusiastically and got a snowball to the back of the head ow hey autumn no magic to get the snowball to come from behind me that not fair i didntdo that autumn protested and giggled as james chucked another snowball at the back of sirius head sirius turned oh you re dead now sirius laughed 88888888888888 autumn awoke to a very loud whistle she groaned and sat up grabbing her wand and covering her ears as much as possible with a wand in one hand she got out of bed and walked out of the room to see sirius in the middle of the hall with his wand pointed to a rather large whistle autumn walked up to sirius and kicked him in the leg repetitively until he laughed and took the spell of the whistle sirius was still laughing that didnthurt autumn said wondering why sirius wasntclutching his leg in pain autumn stood confused in pajama pants and a big t shirt with the letters s n o w on it it christmas sirius bellowed laughing excitedly in response james tackled him hey lighten up it christmas james grumbled and got off sirius standing up um what are we waiting for we didntdo all those christmas decorations to stand here right o sirius said and ran downstairs autumn grinned at james and they followed sirius sirius ran for the biggest present in the bunch and tore it open after making sure it was addressed to him autumn grinned and walked downstairs without bothering to change out of her sleepwear autumn gave a hyper giggle and began to open her presents oy mistletoe sirius yelled and then turned into padfoot and sprinted towards autumn autumn gave an excited scream as sirius knocked her backwards with his paws and began to lick her face aw ew ew ew ew autumn said disgusted until sirius gave a happy bark and trotted back over to where he was opening his presents earlier james was laughing at autumn who was now attempting to wipe the slobber off her face she looked up and saw that in fact she was right under a bushel of mistletoe she moved to the side a bit and rolled her eyes i swear whoever said christmas is for giving is a lying moron james laughed as he opened another package autumn laughed at this and preformed a cleansing charm on her face to get the remainders of padfoot spit off her face hey lookie here a gift from jamesie autumn said grinning james flashed her a marauder grin once autumn opened the package she immediately began to laugh james joined her and sirius ignored them and continued to open packages autumn was now holding up a pair of boy boxers that had a huge gryffindor sign on it annnnd they fit whoever first puts them on so it can be for guys or gals w wow autumn laughed amused thanks you ve got to be joking sirius said wide eyed opening a small package then turned to autumn that amazing sirius said holding up a chocolate autumn grinned i know i was temped to get it for myself and leave you with a pair of socks um a chocolate james asked not seeing why they were amazed yes a chocolate that never melts and remakes itself in your hand when you eat it making it never run out it also doesntadd any fat to you because it disappears out of your stomach so you can eat the same chocolate for days and you wontlose your appetite or get fat james laughed and sirius swallowed the chocolate for the third time and i trust you not to get addicted to it sirius sirius giggled and shrugged a sweater um thanks fall girl james said opening a package with a maroon sweater in it autumn smiled poke it with your wand james did so and immediately life sized snitches zoomed across the sweater brilliant yeah it does something quidditch like every time you poke it james struggled into the sweater eagerly not taking the snitches off it with his wand autumn sighed i love magic i pity muggles sirius said so do i sooo sirius present sirius smiled autumn opened a small package and found it to be a long jewelry case autumn opened the case with a raised eyebrow and found small silver round locket she grinned and pulled the locked out and opened it inside was a close up picture of sirius goofing off and making silly gestures on the other side was a picture of all four marauders being equally as silly each of them fooling around until sirius tackles james autumn laughed clasped it around her neck and thanked sirius 8888888888888888888888888888 remmy sirius yelled and grabbed remus into a big hug james followed and soon all four marauders plus autumn were involved in a group hug yo tengo un gato en mi pantelones grammar autumn yelled at remus enthusiastically sirius broke away from the group hug and gave autumn a confused twitch autumn laughed in a very hyper fashion what the hec james asked and remus said i think it means i have a cat in my pants autumn giggled and ran back into the potter mansion from outside where they were greeting the muggle car that brought remus the four marauders laughed and followed their very enthusiastic friend 888888888888888888888888 autumn changed into her short sleeved little black dress that was a fairly close fit it had the slightest shine to it and a layered neck that drooped down the dress went down to a bit above her knees and as self conscious as autumn felt she also though that she looked ok tonight autumn fixed her hair partially pulled up put the small silver locket sirius had given her on and walked downstairs a half hour before the new years party to help set up the house james parents were around also which was unusual seeing as they worked a long night shift at the ministry as aurors and when they were home they were usually asleep autumn greeted them formally and then treated her kindly and formally also once james parents went on to a different part of the house someone came up behind autumn and poked her sides causing her to squeal autumn turned around to see james in a black and white suit looking stunning and looking like he had attempted to gel his hair down hey autumn said enthusiastically and james replied with a wide grin then autumn went to wearing a more serious expression you never told me exactly how many people are coming to this thing james laughed loads of people trust me most of them are random rich witches and wizards you have never met ah i see autumn said concerned and it not a problem at all that i a muggle born oh no but i wouldntwalk around flaunting it yeah dontworry you just stick with sirius while i greet random people and then after they all get settled in we can go do whatever the hec we want autumn smiled ok sure james gave autumn a reassuring smile and said you look sexy tonight and wiggled his eyebrows gave a huge wink and nudged her in the side autumn laughed and gave him a light playful smack of the shoulder you dontclean up so bad yourself autumn smiled in return and spotted a bored sirius in the distance walking around randomly she motioned for sirius to come over and he did so hey autumn you re looking hot sirius said carelessly and autumn smacked her forehead and blushed aw hey you didntblush when i said you looked sexy james teased and autumn noted well you dontlook too bad yourself autumn smiled mischievously at sirius who also gave the slightest blush enough compliments it making me feel sick james demanded and said oh i have to go help my parents then ran off sirius raised an eyebrow and laughed yeah i guess we should gooo help too then sirius gave a huge blush and autumn laughed your voice squeaked yeah yeah i know sirius said embarrassed aw dontworry about it autumn said patting sirius on the back it means you re becoming man and who knows maybe you ll mature a bit in the process autumn teased and sirius glared at her autumn giggled and followed james after a bit of thought sirius looked over at where autumn was walking off but the question is do you really want me to mature me screaming no i dontwant you to mature dang it stay 15 forever wait he 15 right calculates sure christmas is in 11 days yey us i hope you have a happy holidays no

happen to autumn and co that not good at all although i swear i only do this with the boring teachers giving lectures i have 2 new teachers this trimester named mrs potter and autumn apperson ms apperson hahaha i have a potter and an autumn isntthat ironic have a wonderful winter vacation fanta canadian coco chick thank you i didntthink any1 would actually like my style of writing most people say i put too much of my characters thought in it but i know that and i cantstop it d thanks again o ya and i forgot to put the disclaimer for chapter 2 so heres for both chapters disclaimer anything you recognise isntmine it is jkr s chapter three fires and study habits breaking my back just to know your name seventeen tracks and i ve had it with this game i breaking my back just to know your name somebody told me the killers month after month passed and before i knew it it was final exam time i wasnt that nervous because i probably already knew everything that was going to be on the test but still it was my first exams and you never know so obviously i spent all of my free time you guessed it with my nose buried in a large textbook i forgot all about the sandy haired boy i didnteven know his name study study study i donteven remember the last part of my first year as i look back you know how when you dontwant a day to come it comes so much faster well that what happened to me i didntwant to go back to my old life then again if my dad tried anything i would just threaten him with magic muahahahaha i ran to get the mail as i did every day especially around this time because we were suppose to be getting our exam i ran up to the door grabbed the mail and ran back to the kitchen table i franticly went through the different letters in search for one with the hogwarts seal on it and i found it yes i whispered to myself and ran upstairs to my room to open the letter leaving the rest of the mail mostly bills for my mum to take care of i ripped the letter open while sitting on my bed and scanned the page for my grades pass with flying colors excellent bla bla bla exceeds standards whatever transfiguration no damn i sure you could guess my grade well actually it wasnt that bad but i knew i should have gotten a lot better than that much better i buried my face in my hands and took a few deep breaths i didntcry because i knew i shouldn t there were things in life worth crying over but this wasntit maybe the time would come when i genuinely cried but i couldntthink of a time when i truly cried over something crying worthy i folded the letter back up stuck it in the envelope and grabbed my wand from under my pillow and fiddled with it maple with an ebony handle unicorn hair good for work in charms but not transfiguration o well i ll just have to study harder is that even possible of course it is and i answering my questions again mum i going to the park ok autumn i wore my worst t shirt and shorts and walked out to the park it wasntthat far away once i got there i checked to see if anyone was around then walked into a small forest off to the side of the park and once i got to about the middle of the forest which wasntthat far in i climbed up a tree and into the highest still secure branch there was then i just sat there i ve been doing a lot of that lately huh just sitting around rather boring really when i finally decided to come down the sun was setting i figured mum would be mad but it was ok i walked home slowly taking in air i had missed fresh air in hogwarts in the cooped up slytherin common room when i finally reached my block and turned a corner i could sense something was wrong more like smelled something was wrong i bolted for the house to find it in flames there were so many things running through my head at this point that i dontthink i ll list them all out things like fire how mum i know it mean but i didntthink about my dad much i franticly looked around there were muggle fire departments and random people running around but i was looking for my mother what i did see was close but not close enough i saw my father walking towards me not looking the slightest bit singed looking sad no he walked up to me and hugged me after i pushed him away and muttered something he gave me a grave expression and said she still in there nice way to put that huh i looked over to the building it was already burning to the ground against the efforts of the firemen i shook my head and walked closer to the house my father put his hand on my shoulder but i was too numb to feel it as i look back i realize i didntcry until much later i guess it didntsoak in for a while then i turned and ran i donteven think my dad tried to stop me i ran to who knows where and sat under a tree and looked up at the sky for a while the sky had turned a weird blend of orange red and black school started up again eventually i had gotten a new wand better for transfiguration thank merlin turns out my mum turned in a lot of money into wizarding money and stuck it in a vault at gringotts so with all my stuff packed up and into a trolley along with a barn owl i was happy to run through that barrier at platform 9 because i knew that i would be leaving my horrid excuse for a father and all of the mourning that just depressed me even more out of the old trapped world and into the new trapped slytherin common room not much of change huh maybe i would make friends this year i doubt it but oh well last year at this time mum was telling me good bye as we hugged dad didnteven bother to say bye i smiled to myself trying to look happy and not depressed as i got onto the train i searched for a compartment in the train and when i went up and down the train i finally came to one that didntlook full but not empty either i opened the door and found the marauders minus two james and the sandy haired boy were grinning about something until they saw me james at me while the sandy haired boy looked at me as if to say you re such an idiot i never mind i ll just leave i turned but heard james say no no sit down please i turned and looked at him with a shocked expression at the same time the sandy haired boy did the same thing what i cantbe courteous remus remus technically you can be but you aren t besides werentyou just saying slytherins were slime balls i cringed no remus you misunderstood me i said slytherins think we think they are slime balls i cut in no really that ok i ll just the train started the train started now you have to sit down james said patting the seat next to him by the window no i really donthave to i said shyly oh no i insist i rolled my eyes and sat down by the window just to let you know i donttrust you i told james he raised both eyebrows and replied do you trust remus no i said really fast james looked away looking satisfied what i don t really suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrre you don t i huffed and looked out the window james got up and went and sat by remus and whispered something into his ear i glared at them i may be small but i not stupid evil planning i asked them still glaring james turned yep i rolled my eyes and looked out the window at the passing trees and plants i looked back at remus and james they were still whispering that one long evil plan james replied again yep because i a slytherin i directed this question to remus as a sort of guilt trip remus looked down but james didntcatch on basically ug you two ug so suddenly you re a caveman ugga ugga james smirked shut up i mumbled make me james looked at me straight in the eyes i changed the subject so where are the rest of your little marauding group james grinned with their girlfriends i snorted girlfriends yes girlfriends we re 12 years old that just how we work ew my mum says i i cut myself off and looked back out the window never mind your mum says what james said provoking me i turned back from the window eyes shining with tears looking rather angry she says i shouldnthave a boyfriend till i feel i ready and she says that probably wontbe until much later when did she say that before she died oh sorry no you re not to you it just another slytherin dead right n right but you know what she was a muggle as is my dad i a flippin slytherin muggleborn with no friggin friends i yelled at james ignoring remus who was looking down but that ok with me because i used to it and before he could answer i ran out the compartment and slammed the door shut well that felt good i thought as i walked down the aisle wondering where to go well there was always the restroom but someone might have to go i could go sit in the baggage and be by myself ya that sounded good so i did for the rest of the time i sat with the baggage in the back of the train for some odd reason though i thought maybe either james or remus would come and apologize but i guess i got my hopes up too high because they didn t school started up again nothing new except what we were learning of course but there was always that feeling that i carried around the school the feeling that i almost had a friend but he just had to be in a group of pranksters i donteven know why remus is a marauder he isntquite the type i guess week after week passed by in the same way with that same feeling until it started raining again by this time i made myself forget about remus and james and the rest of the marauders although james and sirius were making it hard for me to forget such as frogs in the slytherin common room itchy rashes on the soles of my feet in potions etc eventually i knew i should stand up to them but i never had the guts i sat in the slytherin common room and stared at the fireplace that had couches placed around it i had completely zoned out and lost track of the time until i heard bianca tell one of her friends g night my head shot up night i still had to do my transfiguration homework i got up and bolted for the slytherin portrait hole a n is that what you call the slytherins main door i tore down the corridor and headed for the library when i entered it was empty so i decided i should probably be quiet i tiptoed through the library glad i wasntcaught yet i spotted the book i needed and grabbed it taking it out of the library and back down the hall i sighed a breath of relief until i heard a very faint sound of a page flipping i snapped my head to the side where i found a door to an unused classroom i slowly opened the door and peered in you re up late researching how to blow up a portrait in the slytherin common room i whispered to remus who was sitting in the corner in a chair reading his head snapped up and he sighed obviously thinking i was a teacher no sure you aren t no really i not sure then what are you reading he held the cover up for me to see you forgot to do your homework last night too i asked he nodded i walked over and sat in a chair next to his i know this isntreally the time to talk but why are you such a back stabbing jerk i said flat out he raised an eyebrow i a backstabber and a jerk yep well i dontmean to be well you are how well let see you badger me about being outside in the rain like you are my mother then dry me off and i actually thought you were being nice to me i actually thought someone was finally going to be nice to me and then later on the train you team up with potter against me until the point that i actually had to get up and leave and sit with the baggage for the rest of the ride you sat in the baggage place you arentgetting the point look i wasntteaming up against you and i only dried you off to be nice i wasntofficially declaring friendship or anything he paused and we both were silent for about 10 seconds why were you put in slytherin anyways he said more quietly because i met a girl that was in slytherin and she didntknow i was a muggle born so we talked and i thought i might actually have made a friend so i told the sorting hat to sort me in slytherin only to have them somehow find out about me being a muggle born later so now not only do they hate me but the rest of the school hates me for being a slytherin and actually the hat was about to put me in griffindor but i mentally yelled at it so it would put me with my friend make sense now he gulped ya well now i have to do my homework what subject he asked me transfiguration i could help you with that i would appreciate that and so he did important if you have a fanfic account then the reply for your review is now in your email if you dontthen i ll still post them here kagami haha then i guess i have hell season because i have to wake up at 4am and be at practice from 5 6 swimming then 6 7 dryland on mon wend fri grrr i love swimming and all but i need sleep i heard they still need to cast the young marauders and lily for ootp movie the old sirius is ugly they d better get a hot young sirius like jason cook or something lol disclaimer i really hungry i should go eat breakfast hmmmm oh right i dontown hp and all that good stuff chapter 30 midnight and a second autumn sat relaxed on a large sofa away from all the music and dancing she was just thinking thinking about nothing in particular hey penny for your thoughts mmm hey james autumn said still deep in thought then pulling herself away from thought world she said do you know what a muggle gun is a weapon that shoots things very good they re a lot like wands wands yeah i mean a gun is such a powerful merciless thing and used in the wrong way so is a wand i suppose so why are you thinking about guns and wands in the middle of a new years party dunno james stood up and offered autumn a hand may i have this dance james teased but still meant it i cantdance doesntmatter i ll lead autumn grinned and let james pull her up 888888888888888888 james laughed as he took autumn on a piggy back ride through the 2nd story of his house while the new years party was still going on downstairs full speed ahead james yelled and ran through the halls as fast as he could autumn giggled insanely like a little girl james came to a sudden stop causing autumn to laugh harder do you realize we are acting like 3 year olds autumn said through her laughs so what james said and sped down stairs to where everyone was sirius ran up to them my turn he said and james dropped autumn to her feet sirius bent down and autumn climbed onto his back sirius ran around people until he got tired and dropped her to her feet you weigh nothing do you know that sirius said catching his breath autumn laughed i ll take that as a compliment i suppose sirius gave a marauder grin and james joined up with them and yelled yey to acting like small children then pumped his fist into the air sirius and autumn did the same and they all laughed again who spiked the punch autumn joked aw come on we didntspike the punch and besides i naturally like this sirius said and james nodded in agreement autumn rolled her eyes i prefer to call it optimism rather than intoxication autumn laughed well i naturally intoxicated sirius teased causing autumn to stick her tongue out at him whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo the tree of them turned to see peter running around wildly with his arms raised james snorted as peter ran up to them excited and sweaty guess what there was this chicken and it had legs and then i ate it hahahahaha they said that peter got confused mumbled something then laughed and passed out james broke out into all out laughed sirius doing the same autumn on the other hand was thoroughly panicking we should get him uhhhhhh what do you do when someone passes out did someone hex him james calmed down and replied no he just intoxicated james chucked at autumn ignorance well isntthat dangerous autumn said flustered i suppose it would be unless you were someone like sirius and i that studied spells for this kind of thing before first year you know in preparation james said entirely too calm you ve been planning to get drunk at hogwarts since you were eleven years old autumn said shocked yup autumn rolled her eyes then take care of him already she begged and james bowed and sirius helped him levitate peter upstairs autumn threw her arms in the air astounded at how idiotic the marauders could be she walked up to perhaps the most or only logical marauder hey remus autumn sighed sitting next to remus on a couch near the music and dancing oh hello did you know that peter got drunk autumn asked remus smiled i believe it he just the kind of person that would fall for that what why remus faced autumn slightly more well peter was very hyper dancing around and had the guts to get turned down by a few girls and said he was very thirsty which is where i guessing he drank lots of the spiked pumpkin juice someone spiked the pumpkin juice you didntknow i thought james and sirius had told you that they spiked the pumpkin juice before they set it out oh i guess they are going to beat me up for telling you now huh autumn sat flabbergasted then stood up angrily not if i beat them up first she declared and stomped off to give james and sirius a piece of her mind when she reached peter room she found peter feeling much better and sitting on the floor with sirius and james looking at a piece of parchment and laughing immediately when entering the room sirius james and peter jumped and faced her you didntspike the punch james gave a lopsided grin you talked to remus didntyou autumn glared at him and sirius interrupted besides we said we didntspike the punch and we didn t we spiked the pumpkin juice there a difference autumn glare nearly burned a hole through sirius aw come on sit down and we will show you some marauder magic autumn switched to wrinkling her nose eh i only mean our hogwarts map oh autumn said and gave in sitting among them sirius eyes sparkled with a sudden interest and pointed to something on the parchment we re watching the people who decided to stay during break and we ve got snape here probably wishing someone cared enough about him to invite them over during break he sitting in this unused classroom see we marked it unused probably sulking he laughed and peter giggled james grinned and there lily she probably doing some studying in the library with her two friends bet you anything she stayed at hogwarts just to keep her friends company really she so considerate autumn rolled her eyes countdown to midnight is probably going to start soon autumn said we should probably head down that depends on if you want to be with a bunch of adults when the new year comes it is said that what you are doing at the stroke of midnight reflects on what you will be doing for the whole of the new year sirius said informatively autumn snorted and you actually believe that well no not really but i also dontwant to be around a bunch of adults when midnight comes i ll go get remus then peter said and he scurried out of the room i say we go into a more interesting room autumn suggested after peter had left i agree let go to my room james said and stood up and led sirius and autumn to his room once there autumn dived onto the bed ha now i can always say i ve been on james potter bed ew why would you want to say that sirius asked for blackmail autumn smiled or she could tell lily and make her incredibly jealous james said dreamily or incredibly disgusted sirius said autumn nodded and james sneered at them autumn shrugged and took of her watch engorgio autumn said taking james wand off his bed side table and performing the spell causing her silver watch to grow she then took the clock sized watch and preformed a spell causing it to hang in midair the face of the watch is clock sized there we go you switched rooms peter said walking into james room yeah your room is too boring james declared technically it not really his room remus said yeah but doesntmatter my room is still much better yeah it is peter agreed and sat down next to james remus came and sat on the other side of james and sirius came up and sat on james bed next to autumn who had her legs hanging off the side of the bed five minutes sirius said from the right of autumn too bad your girlfriend isnthere it tradition for couples to kiss at midnight autumn teased sirius sneered i s pose so three minutes james said autumn the front part of her silky black hair and began to braid it nervously one minute autumn finished braiding her hair and left it loose 30 seconds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 happy new year james set off a cloud of confetti from the tip of his wand that he took back from autumn autumn hesitated and leaned over to her right and kissed sirius quickly on the cheek i post a chapter about christmas 11 days from christmas and now i posting a chapter about new years 3 days before new years i amazing haha jk

looking out the window sitting across from james that was fast ah well let go autumn said gathering her things and heading out with the marauders sirius yawned hope they have a feast prepared i starving you re always starving autumn said playfully a growing boy needs his food sirius said defending himself once inside the great hall the four marauders and autumn sat at the gryffindor table and sirius yelled food and grabbed anything and every edible thing he could find and shoved it in his mouth he began to cough and autumn patted him on the back slow down there donttouch him a voice came from behind autumn said and sirius swallowed autumn turned ah thompson it a pleasure to see you autumn said vehemently likewise patricia said dryly and turned to sirius i haventseen you since before the break you didntwrite to me sorry trish i was busy i ll make it up to you i know you will patricia said sweetly and autumn sneered at her from her seat sirius do i have to sit on your lap other houses arentallowed to autumn blushed realizing the hufflepuff could sit at the gryffindor table no more than a slytherin like herself could she sighed please take my seat autumn said and stood up and strode out of the great hall as naturally as she could patricia sat close to sirius who was no longer trying to shove food down his throat james glared at her now entirely ignoring the conversation he was having with remus how was your christmas sirius asked his girlfriend and she answered wonderful my family went to a party hosted by the robinson s but james cut her off you really cantfigure it out can you james growled at sirius stood up and walked out of the great hall sirius looked after james with a concerned frown but was then drawn into conversation with his girlfriend james stormed down the corridor angered at the stupidity of his friend after a while of searching and cooling down james found autumn sitting on the floor leaning against a corridor wall staring blankly ahead with her knees brought up to her chest and her arms at her sides hi there fall girl james said calmly and sat beside her hey autumn replied nonchalantly so james said a lack of ideas of what to say to cheer her up i heard the new gryffindor password is quaffle james announced smiling autumn grinned you sure know how to cheer a girl up autumn giggled that my job james smirked autumn giggled i donthave to pay you then do i yes in fact you do as payment you have to allow me to give you a piggy back ride to the gryffindor common room and you have to stay there overnight thinking naughty thoughts about having your way with me tonight in your common room autumn joked definitely james answered playfully and raised an eyebrow like a tickle fest autumn laughed 8888888888888888888 who knows how to transfigure a bed james asked why do we need a bed autumn asked james the marauders and autumn were sitting on different beds in the boys dorm in the gryffindor common room because you ll sleep here from now on james replied as if it were obvious but i just figured i would sleep in the common room on the couch no no no you ll be here with us sirius grinned um but you re all a bunch of boys men sirius corrected sure whatever you want autumn smiled so what we re guys james said yeah but not only should i not be in gryffindor but i also shouldntbe sleeping in the boys dorm so since when did we care about breaking rules fine the marauders cheered but i demand the bathroom every night for at least 10 minutes and no one barges into the bathroom while i shower sirius grinned dontyou get any ideas james said defensively you ve got a deal james smiled at autumn then turned to the rest of the group now we need to figure out how to make a bed remus i send you on the task of figuring that out peter i give you the task of trying to clean this place up peter gasps and groans sirius and i will go get all your things from slytherin i believe i remember your bed is the closest to the only window and autumn will do whatever the hec she wants go james demanded sir yes sir sirius yelled then began singing forward march go left go right go pick up the step go left go right go left bring me back to the railroad track left right left the military step the air force rap go left go right go pick up the step go left go right go left ha chelsi i did it autumn raised an eyebrow amazingly enough they were actually able to clean the dorm autumn had nothing better to do so she helped peter clean remus was able to conjure up a four poster bed and james and sirius had a blast bringing all of autumn clothing and belongings from her old common room not to mention raiding her underwear drawer so autumn settled it with the hopes that no one would tell a teacher that she was staying in the boys dorm of gryffindor 8888888888888 hey i think that this weekend you two and i will have a triple date at hogsmead because at the moment all of us are single james said talking to peter and remus sirius on the other hand is still dating that bimbo so he cantcome hey sirius exclaimed i have better things to do anyways like trisha and i are going to hogsmead together sirius said defensively what thompson favourite colour autumn asked with a smirk on her face what kind of question is that what my girlfriend favourite colour just answer the question what does it matter autumn grinned satisfied and shrugged it off so who are you guys going with she asked lying on her bed casually erm three girls named chelsea christine and rachel ciara is sirius date for if he changes his mind about trisha james said and autumn laughed what do you all have against patricia sirius asked james mumbled something under his breath what was that oh nothing at all but sirius glared at james and autumn gave james a questioning look autumn leaned back in her bed and pulled the covers over her you re all immature little boys and it way past your bedtime she said and turned over so anyways james said loudly i met this slytherin today his name is something or another abbott james snorted what an idiot autumn suddenly interested turned and faced them propping her head up on her palm what did he do she asked told us we were stupid to be friends with someone like you actually really autumn smiled knowingly someone like what exactly like a muggle born well he didntexactly use that wording oh of course i didntsee that coming autumn laughed really they should be more creative with their insults it getting pretty dull i agree sirius said disgustedly remus shrugged well they re too stupid to think up anything better arentthey moving back a few subjects seeing as it friday night and we re going to go to hogsmead on sunday i say we do something other than sleep autumn said sitting back up no longer tired when was the last full moon autumn asked remus who answered about two weeks ago why just making sure this wontget in the way autumn smiled she climbed out of bed and grabbed her wand from her bedside table she waved her wand and soundproofed the room and what exactly are you planning to do that fun in the middle of the night that requires soundproofing a room james said with a perverted smirk well that depends are any of you planning on sleeping tonight autumn grinned mischievously just then they heard a snore from the other side of the room i suppose wormtail is then james said i ll take him to the common room eh i think i ll go with him remus said and collapsed on a couch in the common room as james levitated peter out of the dorm and into the common room on a couch by the fireplace james walked back in the dorm and grinned now seriously what are you planning i not really sure i just felt like i shouldntput a perfectly good friday night to waste i think you ve been hanging around the marauders for too long you re starting to think like us sirius smiled is that so autumn said standing up on her bed well right now i thinking i have the random urge to jump on my bed like a crazed little girl she bounced on her bed a few times and then flopped backwards james came and peered over her that because you are a crazed little girl autumn stuck her tongue out at him playfully i ll get the butterbeer sirius yelled suddenly in the mood and ran out and down into the common room making sure to shut the door behind him that the spirit autumn exclaimed sitting up she then hopped from her bed to sirius bed to james bed to remus bed to peter bed then went back and fourth excitedly james stood up on peter bed and waited for autumn to also jump onto peter bed but right after she jumped james lunged and tackled autumn onto remus bed laughing if you wanted some alone time all you had to do was ask sirius grinned as he walked back into the dorm with three bottles of butterbeer in each hand james rolled off of autumn and sat up you guys keep a stash of butterbeer autumn asked what kind of goodie two shoes guys do you take us as of course we have a stash of butterbeer james answered defensively and where do you hide it all not even peter and remus know sirius grinned and handed a bottle to autumn and james then set the other three on his bedside table autumn opened the bottle with her mad skills and lay down on the floor with the bottle clasped in her teeth james and sirius watching amused autumn started cracking up and choking she turned over and took the bottle out of her mouth coughing and laughing insanely james and sirius laughed at her humorous stupidity when she stood up her big t shirt was stained with butterbeer and she had drops of it running down her chin she wiped it off and continued laughing after she calmed down autumn used her wand to clean herself off well that was randomly amazing sirius said grinning thank you autumn said smiling ah that what we re missing music yeah we are how bout this james said grabbed his wand and jabbed it in the air causing music to blare out of nowhere is this wizard music autumn spoke loudly over the music yeah it is i like it autumn grinned but turn it down a notch so we can actually hear each other james rolled his eyes and turned the music down thank you autumn said now i have an idea that i think james will agree with why just james sirius asked nervously well i thought we could dress sirius up like a girl yes james yelled enthusiastically you ve got to be joking no way will i let you do that that too bad because you donthave much of a choice autumn grinned james excitedly grabbed sirius shoulders and shoved him onto a chair preformed a rope binding spell around his arms and chest and then laughed autumn you go get the stuff for the job yes sir autumn said enthusiastically and ran to her stuff to grab make up and hair accessories aw come on you guys wouldntactually sirius whined but autumn stuck her hand over his mouth shut up yes we would autumn said simply and james eyes twinkled with excitement sirius grinned under autumn hand and then licked her hand ew autumn said taking her hand away and wiping it on her pants she then grabbed a tube of bright red lipstick remember it the 70 s and forcibly applied a thick layer of it onto sirius sirius struggled but autumn managed to put some eye make up on him fairly sloppily james having no idea what to do asked how can i help autumn smiled and handed him a small towel go get this slightly damp and put a small amount of soap on it james grinned at the chance to help grabbed the towel and practically skipped to the bathroom autumn then turned to sirius and mischievously said i ve got you all to myself now sure do sirius smiled yup so i guess i can do your hair wiiith a headband no sirius objected how this you untie me and i swear to gryffindor that i wontleave this chair and i will cooperate and why would i want to untie you autumn asked raising an eyebrow because it hurting my arms sirius batted his eyelashes innocently autumn sighed feeling bad for him and undid the spell sirius kept to his promise and didntmove so autumn rummaged through her headbands until she found a red one with a velvet green rose on the side you ve got to be joking sirius groaned no joke autumn said setting the headband down to prepare his hair for the headband autumn mumbled angrily ahh where the brush then shrugged and stood close to sirius and combed his hair back with her fingers slowly a few times to get the small tangles out sirius looked intently at autumn as she combed his hair back with her hands and he reached up and grabbed her wrists as she was half way through combing his hair she stopped mid comb and looked down at sirius who was no longer looking playful he looked up at her peacefully then softly slid a hand up to her shoulder and the other to the nape of her neck and pulled her in and kissed her softly autumn closed her eyes and gave into the kiss forgetting the circumstances and kissed him back the two of them grew steadily more passionate in their kiss and autumn put both hands around his neck making the kiss more intense than before they heard the bathroom doorknob turn and they quickly broke away as james walked out holding the towel in one hand and hiding something behind his back with the other hand autumn i accidentally kind of soaked the towel and then i tried a drying spell but then it dried all the way and why do you have lipstick smudged all over your mouth james asked suspiciously as a smile slowly spread across his face after his smiled turned into an all out marauder grin james handed the damp towel to autumn you must really suck at putting make up on someone if you slip up and get it on your own face yeah autumn said trying to hide her slight blush by looking at the floor as she wiped the lipstick off her face with the towel i really tired now so i think i ll go to bed is that ok yeah of course james said his grin returning to a knowing smile autumn gathered her things and moved them back to her trunk i think i ll go to bed too sirius said awkwardly and used james wand to remove the make up off his face and he took out the headband and put it by his bedside table and he ruffled his hair with his hand and climbed into his bed good night you two james said calmly and sirius and autumn said good night as james pulled out a camera from under the back of his shirt and chuckled to himself muttering the word oblivious then getting into bed himself autumn touch her lips with a finger and frowned slightly 888888888888888 autumn sat by the fireplace the next night after having woken up earlier that day at around noon drinking a bottle of butterbeer that they had left in the boy dorm the previous night you look depressed autumn looked up at james standing over her why that well you haventdone anything with your hair since you woke up and you ve been sitting here practically crying for the past three hours i haventbeen crying sure james said and settled down beside her so was that your first kiss what are you talking about james tilted his head towards autumn come on fall girl i leave for a few minutes and when i come back you have the same lipstick you put on sirius smothered all over your lips how do you think that looks to me i didn t autumn started but james cut her off it ok it not really my business and i understand why you wouldntwant to tell me james said standing up and turning autumn bit her lip then said it was my third autumn said looking at her hands james stopped in his place and then turned with a slight smile on his face really who were the other two with james said coming back and sitting down again autumn took her eyes off her hands and gazed into the flames again she finally let a tear streak down her face then said softly sirius whoa when second year summer at your house right after he tickled me to death on the floor by your stairs she smiled slightly at the memory and then after you guys found that letter and thought i was some sort of death eater or something sirius and i got a detention for not paying attention in class and then we fought and yeah and then last night but sirius tells me everything apparently not james sniffed angrily dontworry about it too much both of us denied that either happened his girlfriend will murder him if she finds out about last night james said smiling a bit autumn shrugged he was just using me as practice for her that not true james protested yes it is no it s guess what everyone sirius shouted barging into the gryffindor common room autumn shifted her gaze in the opposite direction of sirius james rubbed autumn back comfortingly and stood up what sirius james asked i broke it off with patricia yeah james said pumping his fist in the air sure took you long enough though she was such a slutty ugly girl sirius grinned yeah what up with her sirius said softly motioning towards autumn ah she just kind of pissed off at some bitchy slytherin oh sirius said apologetically yeah so how did thompson take it how should i know once i broke up with her i was too excited to stick around to see how she took it sirius smiled how was your hogsmead date chelsea something or another right oh right well i was sort of tired the whole time seeing as we stayed up so late last night but i dontthink her and i were very compatible was she boring or was it because you couldntkeep your eyes and mind off lily sirius grinned oh shove it james said playfully sirius shrugged and walked up to the dorm james walked back over to where autumn was sitting see he wasntusing you for practice james said comfortingly how can he be so bloody happy its like guys have no feelings at all was he not fully awake last night or something autumn fumed james was just sitting there smiling as she went on about how dumb sirius was and what so funny she asked wondering why james was smiling how d you like it like what the kiss last night james said still smiling autumn leaned back onto her hands it was amazing autumn sighed with a small smile james chuckled 888888888888888888 fall giiiiiiiirrrrrrllllll james called out in a girl ish tone right after potions class had finished yes james there a valentines ball this year did you know that you ve got to be joking what are the prefects drunks why do you think that because we just had the halloween ball give us a break autumn put her hands on her hips but they are fun i thought it was suppose to be the guys who complained and the girls who got all excited well we re not exactly normal are we james said smiling autumn looked james up and down and decided no we re not so are you going no please james whimpered no autumn said stubbornly no pressure you ve got two weeks to come up with a sexy dress autumn glared at him no then she smiled you re an idiot james grinned you re not hyper anymore james said his grin turning to a sympathetic smile autumn smiled softly dontworry too much about it she said reached up and ruffled his hair so do you want help getting lily to be your valentine she said her smile broadening james grinned 88888888888888888888888 wake up autumn said bluntly poking james arm whhhhhhhhhhhhy james groaned because it the saturday before valentines day and i determined to help you win lily over james grunted bugger james muttered yeah yeah complain all you want autumn said pulling out her wand and drenching james with a shower of water i up already james groaned loudly and fell out of bed trying to escape the wrath of the autumn vilcent he then scrambled to stand up and then rubbed his eyes at least let me take a shower first autumn rolled her eyes ok but i ll be standing outside the door waiting for you autumn smiled james scrunched his nose stalker then walked towards the bathroom you have 10 minutes autumn shouted as he closed the door ahhh finally someone to whip ol prongsie into shape sirius said from behind autumn autumn raised her eyebrow slightly and turned to face him confused yeah i trying to shape him up for lily you sure you re not trying to shape him up for yourself sirius asked suggestively raising his eyebrows autumn glared at him not taking the comment as a joke like he intended i sure i not sirius shrugged the tension in the air was building up as james walked out of the bathroom with a towel around his bottom half autumn ignoring sirius laughed and said james you ve got quidditch abs already james sneered at autumn playfully and grabbed a set of clothes and walked back into the bathroom after james had left sirius crossed his arms you do like him i don t leave it alone you re annoying it my job to be annoying autumn fancies jamsie autumn fancied jamsie sirius shouted in a singsong voice autumn struggled to reach sirius to cover his mouth with her hand but he kept singing until james walked back in what this i hear about my little fall girl finally fancying me james said with a mischievous grin ah both of you shut up autumn said and grabbed james hand and led him out of the dorm make sure the broom closet you use isntoccupied already sirius called after them and autumn ignored it 88888888888888888888888 right so when you re around lily you tend to reach up and ruffle your hair she hates it but it a nervous habit and we can break it i sure second off dontbe a prick around her that a given autumn instructed while sitting on the professor desk in an unused classroom james sat in one of the student chairs with his head resting on the desk dontfall asleep on me james next girls tend to play hard to get with the guys they like the most james grinned so that applies to lily and you james as much as you may want it i dontlike you autumn said sighing i didntmean me james said taking his head off the desk still grinning this lesson isntabout me autumn said irritated james shrugged maybe it should be ug ok i think you ve learned enough for one day right james said leaning back in his chair with his hands folded behind his head let go do something fun to re hyper a tize you er like what exactly well i would say we should go swimming autumn scrunched her nose and james continued but seeing as you would complain that it is too cold and that the giant squid will capture and eat you we probably shouldn t what do you say we sneak off to hogsmead and buy you a pretty red sparkly dress for the valentines ball james i not going and even if i was who would i go with you donthave to go with anyone just come with the marauders as a group james it a valentines ball the purpose of valentines day is lovey dovey stuff ah well i dontthink sirius has a date yet

stretched i have an idea autumn said smiling suddenly what why dontwe go out to the pitch and you can teach me how to ride a broom i mean what a witch without her magical flying broomstick james jumped up in excitement yeah then he grabbed autumn hand and ran out of the unused classroom 888888888888888888888888888 i hate you die autumn said and pounded her fist into james chest holding an imaginary dagger james staggered backwards and gasped in a fake tone he grabbed the imaginary dagger with both hands and yanked it out of his chest then crumpled on the floor ok ok i ll try one more time get up autumn said grudgingly yey james said springing up to his feet but this time if you fall you re going to break my broom and i ll smack you james warned autumn oh yes let worry about our broom before the safety of our friends quidditch first food and water next friends last great i feel loved autumn sniffed ok mount the broom and push off lightly you can go as fast as you want in the air because you ve got the control and direction part down but when you come back to the floor pull up slightly as you go down and then you should be horizontal by the time you are near the floor got it yes sir autumn said and pushed off after she mounted the broom she flew around the rings then zoomed back over to where james was she flew downwards trying to pull up but feeling like she would just fly upwards no no no that good keep pulling up james called up to her and autumn kept flying downwards until she hit the floor softly i did it autumn squealed happily yeah james pumped his fist in the air and high fived autumn autumn was grinning widely as she hugged james let go celebrate by eating dinner i agree i starving let eat 888888888888888888 do you have the rose yeah james said nervously to autumn as she prepared him to ask lily to the valentines ball i think you ll do great james thanks james smiled then ruffled his hair stop ruffling you hair dangit oh sorry now go ok james said obediently and walked out of the gryffindor common room autumn sighed and mumbled to herself poor guy then she walked up to the boy dorm she sat on her bed nervously awaiting james results with lily he going to get dumped again sirius said walking into the dorm maybe but if he plays his cards right then she wonthate him as much yeah maybe sirius said and absent mindedly pulled of his shirt and walked into the bathroom to take a shower after he walked in autumn pounded her forehead with her fist trying to get the image of his muscled back out of her mind headache remus said walking into the dorm yeah i suppose you could call it that so you trained james to ask a girl out that a first yeah i hope he does ok he really does like lily yeah he does remus shrugged but if it only a one sided love it shouldntbe pushed too much i suppose so i just feel so bad for james so do i remus walked over and pulled out a textbook and piece of parchment and began to finish his homework sirius walked back out the shower much like james had days before with just a towel around his bottom half autumn turned to look then immediately regretted it as she winced and began to pummel her head again what up with you sirius asked headache autumn answered without looking up oh sirius said slightly sympathetically then walked back into the bathroom with a bundle of clothes in his hands remus looked up from his homework he drives you crazy doesnthe remus said smiling autumn only replied with a groan guess what james exclaimed happily as he waltzed into the dorm autumn sat up excitedly did lily except no she already has a date but she said i was pretty cute and that i wasntso much of an arrogant prat anymore james grinned good autumn smiled did she take the rose yeah she did she also said that she was happy that i didntgive her a lily because her date and all other guys give her lilies and she is sick and tired of lilies because it no longer original to say lily for lily autumn stood and hugged james you re so close next time you ll get her autumn said unless you call her a know it all carrot top again remus said not taking his eyes off his homework aw shut up moony james sneered and remus smiled oh and i only ruffled my hair once and that was behind her back good job i proud of you autumn said sincerely so what did you guys do while i was gone well sirius came out remus started finally putting down his homework shut up autumn frowned what happened james said eagerly sirius came out of the shower with just a towel on and it drove autumn crazy remus grinned autumn sniffed in defeat really when i didnthave a shirt on you didntgo crazy james grinned mischievously shut it so now that lily not going to the ball with me i still open james smiled so now you can go

walked back out hey how d it go with lily she already has a date but i still going to the ball bet she secretly lurrrves me james grinned yeah sure sirius said sarcastically autumn rolled her eyes and climbed into bed and sirius sat on his bed next to hers go to sleep guys or you ll be tired for classes tomorrow morning ma am yes ma am james said saluting to autumn playfully 888888888888888888888888 sirius you suck at tying ties autumn said as the marauders minus peter were getting ready for the valentines ball you think you could do better then try sirius challenged fine autumn stood up and walked over to sirius she untied his tie then perfectly tied it there see where d you learn to do that eric taught me autumn could have sworn sirius twitched but she dismissed the idea she made eye contact with sirius then asked so who are you going with sarah williams autumn forced the urge to roll her eyes right have fun with what s her face autumn said tugging on sirius collar james smiled sympathetically sure you dontwant to go autumn james asked it ok to go alone james and i are yeah i sure okay then we d better be going sirius said and then walked out autumn grabbed james shoulder before he walked out who sarah williams she said quietly some blonde chick that threw herself at him james smiled right have fun and dontruffle your hair or be an idiot near lily i ll try and with that they were all gone autumn sighed and flopped onto her bed freaking valentines day she muttered to herself it was 7 at night and she wanted to do something other than sitting around moping and waiting for everyone to get back she sat up and walked two beds over to james bed she opened his trunk and carefully rummaged through his stuff until she found a blank piece of parchment she pulled it out smiled and closed the trunk she walked back over to her bed and laid on her stomach pulling out her wand and tapping the parchment i solemnly swear that i am up to no good she whispered and the parchment came to life with little dots labeled with names that were moving across the parchment what are you doing peter asked walking into the dorm looking at the marauder map why for fun right well i going to bed peter said going over and grabbing his pajamas seriously autumn said looking over at the clock it only a bit after 7 i know peter said but before he could change autumn had left the dorm she sat on one of the gryffindor couches and took a closer look at the map in her hands she glanced over the unused classrooms and her eyes fell on a cluster of people in a room labeled the room of requirements she frowned when she saw the names it was a group of older slytherins that she just hardly recognized she decided having nothing else to do that she would go see what was going on she stuck the map on the inside of her robes and jogged out of the gryffindor common room and once she got to a certain point where she knew no one would be watching her she pulled the map back out and followed it to the point where she would just have to turn a corner and would be around the room she took a deep breath and turned the corner she was faced with a blank wall she blinked and re checked the map there should have been a door right in front of her she frowned stupid marauders and their stupid map she slumped against the wall starting at the blank wall if it werentfor the map she probably wouldntbe able to get back but because she was in no rush she just relaxed just then the blank wall in front of her opened like a big door autumn stood quickly still facing the wall which now had a big maple door in it she pocketed the map quickly just as someone in slytherin robes walked out what are you doing here he asked i i don t autumn stammered but he frowned at her and pulled out his wand quickly and pointed it at her autumn cringed as he muttered a spell under his breath and she fell limp against the wall behind her 8888888888888888888 when autumn woke up all she could think about was how hungry and thirsty she was she groaned and opened her eyes realizing she was outside in the dark under a bunch of bushes she stood up and broke out of the bushes she became aware of her surroundings and walked towards the hogwarts castle she stumbled for what felt like hours to the gryffindor common room feeling amazingly weak she walked into the common room not caring who was sitting there and walked up to the boy dorm she opened the door saw all four marauders look up at her from their beds and knowing she was safe she finally collapsed 88888888888888 she woke up again and immediately was engulfed in a hug she strained her voice and said ouch who are you get off me james jumped away from her his eyes going wide damnit she lost her memory hey he yelled to the nurse caring for someone else at the moment james shut up i just didntrecognize you she recognises me james exclaimed happily and swooped her into a hug again james get off me and help me sit she said weakly sheesh demanding james said playfully and helped her sit up autumn winced at the pain in her ribs what happened we have no idea we went to the valentines ball and when we came back you werentthere peter said you had gone into the common room but you werentthere either so we figured you would come back the next morning but you werentthere for classes either and you werentthere for classes the next day and autumn we thought you were killed do you remember anything wait i was going for two days two and a half yeah sirius sighed from the other side of her bed all i remember is wanting to go somewhere on the map oh sorry i borrowed this autumn said and pulled out the marauders map and handed it to james james raised an eyebrow do you remember what you were looking for autumn looked at the floor trying to recall but when she couldn t she just shrugged no idea so how long have i been in the hospital wing a day so you were out for four ish days total sirius calculated for her autumn smacked her forehead that means i ve missed three days of school work ah yes homework is that all you worry about sirius laughed and autumn shrugged she swung her legs out from under the covers and tried to stand but failed as her legs gave in and james caught her ow james picked her up and lowered her back into bed you still need to spend the rest of the week here you need to heal a few broken ribs and regain your strength you ve got to be joking i not and i also not going to let you get out early i want you to be in full health james said protectively yes mother james smiled at this comment but james and i will keep you company as much as we can isntthat right prongsie yeah you have no idea how worried we were about you sirius here cried james grinned oh shove it you know your eyes werentexactly dry either sirius said stubbornly awwww and i making the marauders soft no james and sirius answered at the same time so how were the decorations at the ball autumn smiled leaning her head back on the pillow fantastic but a bit too girly if you ask me sirius scrunched up his nose why you re the girly man autumn teased and instead of getting a sneer from sirius like she expected sirius laughed and with a grin answered you need sleep autumn raised an eyebrow as if he were crazy sleep sirius i ve practically been sleeping for days i dontneed sleep sirius is right fall girl you re weak and you may not seem tired but your body needs sleep to heal magic or not james agreed riiiight autumn rolled her eyes sirius stood up and walked over to the table by her bed and picked up a small vial with purple stuff in it he handed it to her autumn looked up at sirius questioningly whether you want sleep or not you still need your healing potion bottom up sirius smiled went and sat back down yeah yeah whatever she drained the vial trusting sirius she looked over at sirius who looked like he was trying really hard not to crack up what she asked worried what did you put in that stuff sirius finally broke out laughing it a it a sleeping potion sirius said through his laughs oh you ve got to be kidding autumn said realizing she was starting to fall asleep goodnight autumn james said as autumn drifted off into sleep sleepy time sorry i couldnthelp it 888888888888888888 autumn grinned and sprinted towards the gryffindor common room she was thrilled that she could finally get out the hospital wing and back to her life before she reached the common room though she caught sight of james so she ran up and hugged him he jumped out of shock but then realized who it was and squeezed her tight i hate the hospital wing autumn grinned once she finally loosened her grasp on james james smiled you missed a defense against the dark arts test awww way to wreck a mood she said looking at the floor but then looked back up at him and grinned guess what she asked what i have a scar um from the night when james said uncertainly no silly from sirius autumn grinned i dontthink i want to know james said scrunching his nose autumn put her hands on her hips right before my second kiss he pinned me to the floor of the dungeon la la la la i canthear you james said loudly covering his ears and i was wearing a t shirt and i scraped my arm and i got a scar autumn yelled luckily the corridors were empty at the moment oh is that all well that sweet where is it autumn smiled at james sudden interest she showed him the back of her left shoulder and sure enough there was a long jagged scar across her shoulder see yeah i see it it huge how did you not notice it before i did i just didntwant to tell you because the kiss was a secret until now and then i forgot to tell you i just surprised i didntnotice my arm was gushing blood on the dungeon floor i must have scraped my arm against a sharp rock or something yeah a memorabilia he smiled oh hey dontyou have another quidditch match soon yeah against the slytherins grrrrr james said imitating a lion that a pretty sexy lion impression you think yes but dontget thoughts lily wontthink so awwww james sighed let head back to the common room sirius will want to see you they began to walk sooo is it true that you and sirius cried autumn asked smiling well yeah but it not like it was an all out blubber marathon like girls have james smiled autumn slapped his arm playfully do i look like the kind of person who would have a blubber marathon you ve got enough blubber so yes james grinned are you calling me fat autumn faked a sniff gargantuan well you re fatter aren t are autumn said as they entered the common room you re ginormous james said ginormous autumn raised her eyebrows at him james smiled and sirius ran up to them sirius took a good look at autumn and then hugged and squished her harder than james had dontworry guys you re both ginormously fat sirius said jokingly and let go of autumn who was gasping for air after getting hugged so hard coming from someone who looks like you autumn said eyeing sirius up and down i wonttake that as too much of an insult what sirius said confused she just called you ugly mate james smiled ooo you re going down sirius grinned evilly and autumn took the chance to run away sirius chased after her and eventually cornered her grabbed her around the waist and playfully threw her down onto the floor ow you re evil sirius towered over her yes i know thank you you re welcome autumn said sweetly confusing sirius then she pulled out her wand and squirted water in his face she stood up and ran again they played their little game of tag while james smiled knowingly and walked up to the dorm 8888888888888888888888888 it was a sunny day early in april and autumn and the marauders were having a picnic by the great lake autumn was sitting next to james she was making sandwiches for all of them sirius peter and remus were playing exploding snap over on a different towel closer to the lake tomatoes autumn asked james about to grab a slice of tomato ug i hate tomatoes james scrunched up his nose how do you hate tomatoes how about pickles load me up on the pickles ew how do you like pickles autumn said grossed out i dontknow james shrugged make your own sandwich autumn said holding out the partially made sandwich to james nah i change my mind i going swimming and mumsie always said not to go swimming until an hour after you eat james said pulled off his shirt and ran to the lake sirius watched james run to the lake in amusement and ignoring his game also took off his shirt and ran to the lake remus immediately looked over in autumn direction to see if she was blushing at the sight of sirius bare chest more eye candy girls but autumn was looking away from the lake purposefully after a while of the two boys fooling around in the lake and autumn nearly falling asleep sirius and james finally came out of the lake and ran over to where autumn was lying down closing her eyes sirius grinned and shook his wet hair near autumn so that she was splattered by cold lake water i not asleep she said wiping her face and sitting up i know it just looked like fun sirius grinned jams ruffle your hair you look funky with your hair plastered down autumn smiled up at james james sneered and ruffled his hair then sat down along with sirius food sirius demanded yes your majesty autumn said sarcastically but james is making his tomato free pickle filled sandwich by himself yes ma am james saluted and took two slices of bread autumn rolled her eyes and asked what do you want on your sandwich sirius all of the above sirius said enthusiastically he still doesnthave a shirt on d autumn smiled and grabbed a steak knife and cut off two slices off the loaf of bread why are you using a steak knife to cut bread james asked tilting his head why do you have a problem with steak knifes autumn said playfully but not smiling no ma m james grinned marauderish ly but if you keep waving it around like that you ll poke your eye out james warned still smiling yes mother autumn said and finished cutting the bread for sirius you can make your own sandwich too here you go autumn said looking up and handing two slices of bread to sirius who shrugged and began to make his own sandwich after they had all finished their sandwiches sirius crouched then touched autumn on the shoulder and yelled you re it then he bounced up and ran away autumn grinned then tagged james and said you re it then ran away soon peter and remus had joined in too and they got caught up in an all out tag game sirius was it and was currently chasing down autumn he lunged himself at her and tackled her to the floor you re it he grinned but didntget off of her she turned around so that she was facing sirius lying under him put a shirt on she smiled stuck her tongue out at him wiggled her way out of his grasp and ran to tag james sirius was it again and he came after autumn again autumn laughed and ran over to the towel with all the food on it grabbed the first thing she could find on the towel then as sirius came after her she fell on her back and held out whatever she grabbed and closed her eyes once autumn felt a jerk on her hand she opened her eyes a crack and then she opened her eyes all the way she gasped and pulled back her hand she had just stabbed sirius in the stomach with a steak knife dum dum duuuuum autumn

grabbed and closed her eyes once autumn felt a jerk on her hand she opened her eyes a crack and then she opened her eyes all the way she gasped and pulled back her hand she had just stabbed sirius in the stomach with a steak knife autumn shuddered in disbelief and she pulled the knife out of sirius bare abdomen she felt warm blood streak down her arm as she watched sirius double over in pain she finally got her sense up enough to stammer j james james was smiling until he turned over and saw what was going on sirius he yelled and sprinted over to where they were sirius was taking wheezy breaths clutching his stomach blood soaking everything around him eventually he fell forward and passed out sirius siri we we have to help him autumn said her face flushed in shock she crawled over to sirius unconscious body and turned his body over remus go get madame clark peter had already gone inside james instructed kneeling next to sirius and grabbing one of their shirts off the floor he crumpled it up and pressed it down where sirius was cut open autumn quickly checked his pulse and knew he was still alive she covered her eyes with her hand and shuddered a sigh i didntmean to i didn t autumn hand me that shirt james commanded and autumn did so quickly and helped him put pressure on the wound james why isntit stopping autumn said panicking it really deep autumn he said looking up and saw madame clark running towards them with her wand in hand autumn and james ran up to the hospital wing right behind sirius who was being levitated by madame clark remus had caught up with them and was now running along with them once they entered the hospital wing madame clark immediately began to grab books and potions and hurriedly told the remus james and autumn autumn and james were standing there covered in sirius blood you re going to have to leave for now madame clark said in a panicked voice not wanting to argue the three teenagers hesitated and left autumn giving sirius one last look at his pale face before they all left the three of them entered the common room not having spoken a word they headed up for their dorm when autumn whispered i going to stay down here for a while she said weakly james nodded and the boys went upstairs autumn looked around the common room but walked back out of the common room instead she didntquite know where she was going but she was running through the corridors running up many flights of stairs before she knew it she was entirely unsure of where she was so she walked into a girl bathroom she walked into a stall and threw up the sight of her best friend bleeding like that was too much for her stomach to handle she wiped her mouth walked out of the stall and walked up to a mirror she examined the blood that stained half of her pale forehead and her once white clothing were now blotched with red and she looked down to see that her stockings and part of her skirt was covered in blood she held up her hands and her hands and sleeves were entirely soaked in blood she put both her hands on her fore head slumped down the wall between two of the sinks and cried 88888888888888888888 james had explained to peter what had happened and the three marauders sat in silence on their own beds for a while then james spoke up how do you think autumn is taking this probably worse than any of us remus replied and james nodded probably james ruffled his hair out of stress and said softly i going to go check on her i worried about how she is remus nodded silently and james walked out of the dorm james walked down the stairs looked around the empty common room and whispered autumn he looked around the common room a bit and then walked back up to the dorm how is she remus asked immediately james walked over to his trunk and began rummaging through his things before he replied she not here he said simply peter perked sat up a bit what do you mean she not there remus asked with a worried expression on his face she just not found it james said pulling out the marauders map he flipped it open and began to search it she in the girls bathroom next to the astronomy tower all the way up there peter groaned well you donthave to help us find her if you dontwant to james snapped at peter actually you know what i think i ll go find her myself remus do me a favor and go check on sirius and see if they ll let us see him yet remus shrugged yeah okay i guess remus said half afraid of james in his pissed off state james practically bolted out of the dorm 88888888888888 autumn wiped the tears that were streaking down her face and decided to walk up a flight of steps she found herself in the astronomy tower and she sighed finally knowing where she was she sat down on the floor and looked up at the stars as stupid as it sounds she actually wondered where the sirius star was little science lesson the star sirius is the biggest star in the night sky it is 2 4 times larger than our sun and 4 times brighter but because it is so far away it doesntseem so so next time you look up at the sky and see a really big star point and say look it the sexiest star in the sky and then everyone around you will think you re a total nut job bonkers crazy insane etc this has been a mini astronomy lesson from me to you after a while though she got cold so she walked out of the astronomy tower and wandered hogwarts as if she had never seen its corridors before she became lost again but she didntmind too much knowing she would eventually recognize where she was soon she came about a familiar place although she couldntquite pinpoint it in her memory she turned a corner and found herself face to face with a very familiar looking older slytherin you re back he asked her what autumn asked thoroughly confused the boy pulled out his wand and aimed it at her quickly but before autumn could even move the boy wand flew out of his hand and landed on the floor out of his reach autumn looked over to where the disarming spell came from and smiled as she saw james standing there dontmove james said his wand on the boy but the boy didntlisten he swung his arm out and banged the wall next to him james acted on impulse and yelled stupefy a bolt of red light shot at the boy and he fell on the floor stunned just as the boy fell a big maple door behind him opened but before autumn could see who was behind it james grabbed her arm and whispered run she did they ran as fast as they could back around the corner that they came from and james led autumn up a flight of stairs and they ran until autumn realized where they were and they both ran towards the gryffindor common room they reached it gasped the password and stumbled inside collapsing on the floor almost immediately after they caught their breath james sat up and said you ought to take a shower you need it more than i do i think autumn nodded and said thanks and she meant it for more than just letting her have the shower james stood and helped autumn up he glared at a couple of second years that were looking at them weird seeing as they were still covered in blood 88888888888888 autumn was sitting on her bed combing her wet hair waiting for james to come out of the shower so that they could talk when remus walked through the door they re letting us see sirius now remus informed them autumn jumped up from her sitting position and james opened the door and walked out with a towel around his waist james they re letting us see sirius autumn said almost excited oh james said grabbed a pile of clothes and quickly changed in the bathroom then came out and walked with remus peter and autumn out of the dorm out of the common room and they headed towards the hospital wing once they reached the hospital wing they walked inside and ran up to sirius james was the first to speak is he unconscious he asked madame clark yes he hasntwoken up yet unfortunately he lost a lot of blood and none of the spells i ve tried have closed up the wound it not quite normal it not quite normal autumn asked angrily why is it not quite normal he has some sort of wizarding infection the wound doesntclose up completely for a while i not sure exactly how he got infected though lupin here tells me that you two tried to stop the bleeding with a few shirts yeah james said worriedly madame clark made an mmm noise as if considering the fact then said you four can stay here for a while he wontneed medication for a bit of time but if he becomes conscious again i want you to call me immediately alright the four teenagers nodded and she left them alone with sirius autumn looked at the floor and crouched down near sirius still looking down james crouched next to her reached over and squeezed her hand tightly and smiled gently he ll be ok he d better be autumn said looking up at sirius 88888888888888888888888 autumn james whispered shaking autumn awake from her bed it was a few days after the accident sirius still hadntwoken up and autumn had just left the hospital wing for the first time to sleep in her own bed for a night autumn woke from her light sleeping mode and whispered what wrong autumn sat up and rubbed an eye sirius has gotten worse they dontthink he ll make it by the end of the week unless they take him to st mungo s autumn jumped out of her bed and ran bare footed through the hogwarts corridors headed towards the hospital wing with james right behind her autumn burst into the room and found sirius bed surrounded by madame clark professor dumbledore and the other two marauders what wrong what happened autumn said her face pale with panic the wound opened up again and it was harder this time to stop the bleeding i afraid he lost a lot of blood remus whispered to autumn well canthe get blood from someone else isntthere a spell or a potion that could fix all this we arenta bunch of muggles we can do something autumn burst out angrily no one answered her at all but they instead levitated sirius out of the room and supposedly somehow took him to st mungo s autumn watched as the adults sirius remus and peter all walked out james stayed behind and looked down at a very sleep deprived frustrated girl james autumn whispered i dontunderstand something like that could be dangerous to muggles but in the wizarding world it should have been healed days ago james just shook his head slightly and looked at the floor as if to say he didntunderstand either 88888888888888888 their professors allowed the marauders and autumn to stay in st mungo with sirius for a certain amount of days after three days of sirius being taken care of the adults began to loose hope autumn sat by sirius more than anyone else purely out of guilt for what she had done she would have been found banging her forehead repetitively muttering something along the lines of stupid autumn was sleeping on a small couch that a nurse had conjured up for her she opened her eyes and looked up at where sirius was lying and found that the reason she had woken up was because sirius was groaning and turning in his sleep autumn rubbed the sleep out of her eyes quickly and got up to go sit next to him his eyes snapped open and he fixed his eyes upon autumn his eyes full of fear autumn sat in the chair near him pulled her chair up and whispered softly good morning and brushed back a strand of hair from his face with her hand the fear softened slightly from sirius eyes as he tore his eyes away from autumn and quickly scanned the room he opened his mouth to speak but wasntable to form any words i ll be right back autumn said slightly nervous and rushed out of the room bringing back a nurse with her a few minutes later he just not use to talking yet when we magically hydrated him it only went to his blood but the process parched out his throat it easy enough to cure she said knowledgably and pulled out a white wand and put it softly to his throat and whispered a spell sirius turned to his side coughing sirius are you okay oh yeah brilliant sirius said sarcastically rolling onto his back and clutching his lower abdomen i so sorry sirius i didntever mean to hurt you autumn said pleading for forgiveness james peter and remus walked in james grinning madly you re awake james said and walked up and gave sirius a man hug sirius groaned in pain and muttered gerrof james laughed and let him go the nurse cleared her throat so as to be noticed and commanded i going to change the bandages now so i ll need you four to leave for a little while yeah okay james said and the rest of them nodded and hesitantly walked out of the room the nurse eventually walked out to the waiting room where the four teenagers were seated and smiled i have good news his wounds are finally beginning to close up completely and after we replenish him he will be able to leave without having to get a blood transfusion autumn and the boys grinned james stood slightly but the nurse stopped him we just need a few more minutes to be able to get him back to normal and we believe from here on out with the magical medical attention we can provide his recovery will be amazingly quick so if you four could just stay out here for a little longer james sat back down stubbornly and autumn rolled her eyes at him about fifteen minutes later with autumn leaning against james shoulder sirius walked out with the same arrogant strut as before autumn perked up and smiled sweetly at his figure he rubbed his sore abdomen and smiled back she told be to put some stuff on it everyday to make the scar disappear he shrugged and stuck a small tube in his pocket so are you out of here james asked impatiently yeah we re out sirius laughed and autumn sighed relieved at his lighting fast recovery oh and autumn i forgive you really just like that well let just say i ve had a whole lot of time to think he grinned playfully she smiled thankfully thanks sirius yeah now let get out of here the walls and floors are a creepy shade of white it depressing sirius shuddered white autumn raised an eyebrow yeah it like i in a clinic or something it creeping me out sirius motioned for them to get moving 888888888888888888888888 honestly i was afraid you would hate me autumn said to sirius when they were cozily back in their dorm awww how could i hate a face like that sirius said playfully taking a few steps forward and tilting her chin up to the level of his eyes she laughed and he let her go well good i wouldntbe able to bear not having a little puppy in my life a very sexy puppy too he smirked of course whatever you want girly man ah dang i thought you had forgotten about that nickname never autumn said dramatically flinging her arms in the air and throwing a white towel at him go take a shower she demanded yeah yeah yeah oh and by the way i not planning on using this he said walking towards the bathroom but turning around to pull something out of his pocket and throw it at her he walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind him autumn heard the door click and she looked down at what sirius had just thrown at her she smiled as she read the label gordon scar remover she chuckled and james looked up from where he was working on his homework on his bed and teased flirt awww look autumn and sirius are flirting but dontget your hopes up because i have some more drama planned for the next two chapters that will wreck the rest of autumn 4th year and summer i feel evil and amazingly powerful insert evil laugh here so at school we took our second finals and now i in all my cool classes i designing the set for our school play and

thank you once again and yes strip poker and mud wrestling are two things in this chapter shhh donttell now on to the short ish chapter chapter 33 ego booster autumn opened the door to their dorm to find the four marauders sitting around a round table with james taking off his tie and tying it on his head then she noticed they were playing cards and then she noticed that james and sirius were shirtless and sirius was in just his boxers which were red i mean cough autumn isntlooking at the details of his boxers of course not uh do i even want to know sirius looked up at her and grinned we re playing strip poker he said enthusiastically and i losing want to join us he said smirking james tied a tie around his head and autumn crossed her arms shouldntyou be working on all that homework you need to catch up on well that what i was doing and then james here said i needed a way to relax and get my mind off of homework so i suggested strip poker and remmy here decided he would win anyways and wouldnthave to take anything off and we let peter win so he doesnthave to take any clothes off hey peter protested against sirius but sirius just shrugged i thought strip poker was a girl game autumn said is it sirius said perking up next time you play invite me over sirius grinned and james laughed autumn rolled her eyes and walked over to where sirius shirt was thrown she tossed it at sirius head and grabbed a book that was left open on his bed i forgive you boys for being a bunch of babbling idiots she said and thrust the book onto the table in front of sirius and pulled up a chair which she sat on backwards facing the homework laid out in front of sirius what you seriously want me to work on it sirius said looking at autumn as if she were insane yes transfiguration isntthat difficult if you force yourself into believing that it the best class of all time that what i do it makes you feel like you want to learn it uh huh sirius said buttoning up the last button of his shirt james sighed and began to clear the table off in defeat sirius scooted the book closer to him and hesitantly began to read there a good boy autumn joked and patted sirius on the head then ruffled up his hair about a half hour later sirius slammed a book shut and set it aside grabbing another book for the last bit of homework he had potions should die slughorn should die sirius said frustrated and ran his fingers through his hair right autumn said and walked over to sirius from the other side of the dorm i guessing that a desperate call for help i dontneed help i smart enough to figure it out sirius said defensively of course you are autumn said pulling up a chair and looking down at a piece of parchment that had instructions written across the top in their professor handwriting all you need to do is explain in half a foot of writing why it wouldntwork if you add the boomslang before stirring it five times all i need to do are you insane who cares if you add the stupid ingredients at a wrong time sirius the boomslang cantbe stirred in there or else it would disintegrate into the liquid before you got the chance to add the last ingredients oh well that easy sirius said starting to write james smiled and said good thing we ll always have autumn to help us with our homework huh james laughed not that you need homework help though you donteven pay attention in class half the time and you still get super good grades autumn said to james slightly annoyed james grinned i know i just naturally smart autumn rolled her eyes and said to sirius do you get it yeah thanks sirius said scribbling furiously autumn stood up and was about to leave when she pointed at sirius paper you spelled completely wrong the e comes before the l not after shut up miss know it all sirius smirked then pulled out his wand and waved it in front of himself what are you cookies autumn said enthusiastically sirius grinned he had conjured a box of cookies and took one out for himself everyone currently in their dorm stormed for the cookie box fish ud oo upid omerk autumn said with a mouth full of a chocolate chip cookie what sirius said after swallowing finish up your stupid homework autumn clarified right whatever sirius grabbed his quill and shoved the box of cookies to the other side of the table he wrote a few more sentences then put down his quill and used his wand to dry the ink happy yes now you donthave to worry about your homework until monday so we have the rest of tonight and tomorrow to do whatever we want tomorrow is sunday right yup james answered and pulled on a shirt and tomorrow is the first of may technically for that to work it would have to be either 1766 or 1777 but whatever autumn nodded then looked out the window it still raining i thought it would have let up by now autumn said solemnly yeah everyone has mud stains all over their pants now remus said also taking a look out the window autumn tore her gaze away from the window and looked at sirius who was grinning at her madly what she asked eyeing his grin sirius stood up excitedly and grabbed autumn forearm and began to pull her towards the dorm door sirius hey boys what re you waiting for come on sirius called back at the rest of the marauders and they followed sirius and autumn sirius continued to pull autumn and by now she had pretty much given up on restraining his pull sirius slow down or i ll trip over sirius laughed and began to run a little faster down a corridor autumn realized something and whispered sirius it after curfew we re not suppose to be out of the common room we re not supposed to be out this late even on weekends sirius didntanswer until they reached outside come on sirius said impatiently and pulled autumn out onto the grass and a bit closer to the forbidden forest there was a huge mud pit filled with pure mucky mud sirius laughed and used autumn forearm to pick her up like a baby and throw a shrieking autumn into the mud pit the rest of the marauders caught up and realized what was going on autumn took advantage of sirius looking at the rest of the marauders to pull on his arm causing sirius to fall in the mud pit next to her he grinned and attacked james with the help of autumn the two of them were able to get all the marauders involved in mud wrestling ok am i the only one going crazy by all this strip poker and mud wrestling in one chapter this is insanely sexy within ten minutes most of them were covered in mud to the point of them not being able to recognize each other right off the bat it was now about five in the morning in the mud they would try to stand to grab someone else and end up sliding and slapping back into the mud themselves sirius was able to grab a slippery hold on autumn and pull her over him and into the mud on the other side of him she attempted to grab him by the arms and flip him into the mud but failed and ended up falling on top of him of course she leaned over him laughing and a mud covered necklace fell out of her shirt she didntnotice but sirius was quick to reach up and grab it she looked at what he was doing and if she werentcovered in mud she would have been blushing sirius flipped the necklace over in his hands for a second with autumn still lying flat on top of him he grinned i know what this is autumn tried to hide a smile no you don t she said and grabbed the necklace out of his grasp and stuck it back in her shirt how often do you wear it sirius asked playfully and in the background they could hear james roar and attack either remus or peter aw shut up autumn said making sure the locket was hidden you wear the locket i gave you every day how that for an ego booster autumn stuck her tongue out at him and he flipped her over and pinned her in the mud you re evil autumn said smiling despite herself and you re pinned below me again he also smiled and what happened last time you were pinned to the dungeon floor he said mischievously yes but if you kissed me right now we would both taste mud and worms wouldntwe autumn smiled not even trying to struggle under sirius sirius scrunched up his nose and agreed yeah you re right so i ll just have to do sirius stood up carried autumn again and flipped her into the mud then slipped into it himself right next to autumn she then climbed playfully back on top of him then teasingly reached down and pulled his shirt up slightly then attempted to clear the section of mud with her own muddy hand she ran a finger gently across the scar that ran right below his belly button slightly off to the side autumn whispered and you refuse to get rid of that scar just so you can be reminded of me everyday how that for an ego booster she smiled slightly sirius didntsay anything and autumn crawled forward a bit so that her face was right above his sirius smile faded slightly and he softly rolled her over in the mud so that he was now above her he leaned down and kissed her softly both of them forgetting they were covered in mud until the kiss became slightly open mouthed when they both began laughing and spitting out the mud that they got in their mouths whoo they heard and both of them sat up slightly and looked over at remus peter and james who had cheered neither of them had realized that they had all went dead silent a while ago and were watching sirius and autumn little scene intently sirius grinned triumphantly while autumn covered her face with her hand obviously embarrassed by getting caught wow i think i had too much fun typing that the sun rising sirius said simply and he watched amused as autumn took her hand off her eyes to get a look at the rising sun yeah autumn said and they were all silent for a few minutes as they watched the sky turn lightened we should probably get back inside remus said and they all attempted to stand up in the mud the slipped and slid their way out of the mud pit and they all helped each other clean themselves up with their wands the five of them began to walk back inside all squeaky clean sirius ran up to remus and said something witty while james stayed back with autumn so that four kisses now james asked smiling does it really take that much of a hint autumn shrugged it not that easy sirius is more of a playboy mmm james murmured agreeing once they reached their dorm as quietly as they could the five of them passed out on their beds without a second thought and fell asleep wow i really like this chapter i might just refer to this chapter when i need my daily dose of sirius heh two chapters in a week i rock this chapter was kind of short but it the chapter before the drama starts up i think oh right and i meant to tell you guys last chapter but i have new screen names for you guys to reach me at msn autumnvilcent at aim

thanks for the review and i hope you like this next chapter d kagami yes i gave sirius red boxers only because he already has navy blue swim trunks either way it major eye candy right hah thanks for the review chapter 34 party like it 1975 autumn was currently glaring daggers into the back of sirius head while she sat behind him in potions she was glaring at sirius because he was gazing dreamily at a girl at the table in front of him who she autumn asked james motioning towards the girl sirius was staring at james resisted the urge to roll his eyes and answered something or another anderson you dontknow her first name autumn asked james answered with a shrug why do you care james said letting a small smile show i don t autumn answered simply and pretended to listen to the professor she did hear a question the professor asked and she started to raise her hand when what s her face anderson quickly raised her hand and the professor called her name to answer the question before autumn could even get her hand in the air autumn gaped at the girl in front of sirius as she had just answered the question correctly looks like someone finally beaten you james teased a speechless autumn james realized autumn was seriously shocked so he chuckled autumn people have answered a question sooner than you before yeah i suppose so autumn said drifting off into thought and it not like sirius hasntever had a girlfriend either james pointed out and autumn shrugged the professor dismissed the class and the gryffindors and slytherins filed out of the classroom autumn looked back at the classroom and saw sirius who was purposely taking his time putting his books away because anderson was also slowly putting her things away you re brilliant at transfiguration rebecca sirius said with a sweet smile autumn forced the urge to groan and left the classroom before she heard anymore of their conversation rebecca anderson huh autumn thought to herself as she walked down the corridor with james james had given up on getting her attention long ago 88888888888888888888 autumn ran a hand through her hair looking frustrated at the book she was reading in the library james have you ever studied this hard for an exam james looked up from his book and made eye contact with autumn he grinned well every year exams are going to get harder arentthey i guess besides i not studying i writing a note james smiled a note to who lily nah actually it to sirius riiight autumn said rising out of her chair a little bit to peek over and read the letter but james covered it with his arm it personal james said quickly uh huh and why are you writing a personal letter to sirius of all people um i not sure james said folded the note and stuck it in a book why are you studying now the exams are a little less than a month away james said changing the subject well these exams are supposed to be hard better safe than sorry autumn smiled nerd james mumbled and autumn rolled her eyes i going to head up to the common room are you coming james said standing up and picking up his book no i think i ll stay down here for a little longer how long james asked how long i dontknow uh 10 minutes why no reason james said looking like he was trying to suppress a grin mmmhmm autumn said raising an eyebrow james saluted playfully and left the library once autumn was bored of studying which was a little under 15 minutes later she decided to head up to gryffindor she entered the common room greeted with a surprise it seemed the whole of gryffindor was waiting for autumn to walk in she racked her brain quickly and laughed as she remembered that it was in fact her 15th birthday she walked up to where the marauders were standing and hugged james first then hugged all the marauders in turn yeah peter too ew i love you guys she grinned at them and sirius threw a handful of glitter confetti at her james waved his wand and loud music started playing pump up the volume pump up the volume pump up the volume dance dance dontask autumn had a good time she was actually enjoying herself she danced and laughed and talked to cute guys she didnteven know existed she made james promise that he wouldntspike the pumpkin juice so sirius did instead after dancing for what could have been hours autumn finally crashed on one of the couches james quickly sat next to her and yelled over the music we re all giving you your presents tonight james this is a present enough for me autumn laughed james shrugged grabbed her hand and pulled her back out to where everyone was dancing they moved some of the furniture out so that they had space when almost everyone had gone to bed and autumn had finally fallen asleep on the couch james lowered the music and sirius carried her upstairs and tucked her into bed the party had officially finished and the marauders quickly cleaned up the party with a few simple spells autumn woke up early quickly rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and decided she wanted breakfast early so she sat up planning on borrowing the map to get to the kitchens when she lightly stepped on something by her bed she looked down and noticed a small mound of packages autumn smiled and piled them all up on her bed at the same time james opened his eyes and turned to face autumn he hurriedly got out of bed walked around sirius bed quietly and came up to autumn happy morning after your birthday james whispered smiling thank you jamsie but i told you that party was enough of a present for me autumn said james gave a lop sided grin and lied i couldntreally hear you over the blaring music sorry liar autumn mumbled james ignored her and sat on the edge of her bed you ve got to open mine first i told sirius he couldntsee it unless you let him why what d you get me autumn said picking up the present from james and eyeing it suspiciously well that a stupid question just open it james laughed autumn shrugged slightly and opened the rectangular package she pulled out a picture frame she flipped the frame over and snorted autumn blushed i thought you were holding something behind your back that night so do you carry a camera around all the time james laughed softly well actually you two were so engrossed in snogging that you didntsee me peek outside i thought you two were being a bit too quiet so i decided to check on you conjuring a camera is actually pretty easy james grinned autumn rolled her eyes so you took a picture of me snogging a girly man oh right we were dressing him up like a girl werentwe they heard sirius shift in his bed who talking about me and being forced to dress up like a girl sirius said with a just woke up voice your grandma autumn joked sirius chuckled and sat up messing up his hair hey is that the present prongs wouldntlet me see

going to see number 4 thanks for the review disclaimer get over yourselves chapter 35 jason baker james she is so annoying i just knew he liked her autumn said leaning against james in a comfortable friend way sirius and what it looked like his new girlfriend was sitting closely talking to each other softly on the other side of the compartment james grunted lazily agreeing a strong sense of guilt fell upon james and she shifted slightly under autumn weight uncomfortably are you okay autumn asked looking up at james james sighed yeah i fine james paused to reach up and ruffle his hair actually autumn i told sirius he could bring her along who along where rebecca anderson to my house for the summer you ve got to be joking me autumn said getting off james and slumping over i sorry but i couldnttell him no and besides rebecca isntall that bad just get to know her yeah alright whatever james autumn said slouching against the back of the seat autumn didntspeak much at all for the rest of the train ride 888888888888888888888 what was it about anderson that seemed to work like a magnet all the marauders suddenly fled to her especially sirius who seemed extremely taken with her it pissed autumn off it really just pissed her off and the thing that made it even worse is that she couldntjust brush anderson off as just sirius flavour of the week because she didntseem like that anderson was more the helpful and cool in every way possible type of girl hey autumn would you like a sandwich too anderson called from a counter autumn snapped out of her little thought session to reply yeah i guess anderson smiled and proceeded with her damned perfect sandwich making so i thought that after lunch we could all finish our homework to get it over with anderson suggested and all four of the marauders eagerly agreed autumn fought the urge to roll her eyes but also agreed autumn figured that maybe by helping the other with homework autumn had already finished her homework that she could be better than anderson in some way but of course anderson either always knew the answer while autumn didn t or she got to the boys who needed help first autumn pretended to have a bit of homework but gave up eventually and shut her book i gonna go take a little walk ok ok but dontgo so far that you get lost i know this town like the back of my hand autumn lied to anderson who was acting a bit like a mother as autumn left she noticed that all of the marauders were too preoccupied with anderson to even realize autumn had no idea how to get around in the neighborhood but it didntmatter for her she might as well walk around and get lost for all they cared i suppose i being a little too dramatic she just trying to help and it not like the boys are completely ignoring me i just so use to being the center of attention and the only girl in the group that now that anderson came in i being really selfish autumn sighed and walked out the front door and began walking along the sidewalk that bordered the streets after about a half hour of walking she came to the conclusion that she would try and become friends with rebecca after all she did need a friend that was a girl instead of all of her friends being boys she ran a hand through her hair and turned around to head back autumn sighed as she realized she had no idea where she was she briskly walked back in the direction she thinks she came but she knew she would be lost for at least a little while hey you there she heard a male voice call he going to attack me then kidnap me then do who knows what or maybe he actually a cannibal and he planning on salting me and she didnthave time to finish her thought because the male that she heard call after her stepped out from behind a bush and stepped right in front of her cutting her off uh h hullo autumn began nervously looking at the young sun tanned boy who looked about 16 or 17 years old hello to you too he said and grinned down at her you lost um no i was just er she said at a loss for words terrified of the boy in front of her you re lost he stated and chuckled where are you trying to go er the potter mansion autumn managed to say ah the rich side of town you walked far you a potter no they re friends of mine she stated simply so then you must be a witch never heard of a friend of the potters that wasntmagic yeah so are you a wizard yeah going into my 6th year in gryffindor house at hogwarts oh i going to my 5th year at hogwarts autumn said warming up to this boy what your name the boy asked autumn autumn vilcent she said sticking out his hand and the boy shook it pleasure to meet you i jason baker jason said autumn smiled and let go of his hand would you like me to take you to the potters place yeah i d appreciate that thanks jason walked with autumn for more than a half hour until autumn began to recognize the neighborhood that took a long time autumn said curiously yeah i took the long route i hope you dontmind jason said and autumn blushed slightly and shrugged so we re here try not to get lost again it a big city jason joked i ll try not to so er i ll see you soon alright autumn gave him a bashful smile yup we ve got the whole summer ahead of us i ll owl you alright bye then autumn gave him a genuine grin and then walked back into the potter mansion she closed the door softly behind her grinning madly nice to see you re finally back and what are you so happy about james smirked nothing autumn said trying to hide her grin where did you go other side of town why i dontknow autumn said pretending to be frustrated we were worried about you you were gone for a long time james frowned slightly autumn didntanswer she just walked upstairs resisting the urge to roll her eyes or scream i amazed you knew i was even gone hey sirius called from the second floor of the mansion he caught up with autumn wearing his blue trunks and a t shirt and said we re going in the pool do you want to come maybe a little later ok sirius said and hurried downstairs this time autumn did roll her eyes autumn walked into her room and rummaged through her trunk for her swimsuit if she couldntbeat them then she d have to join them she was changing when retiues her owl tapped on the window eagerly yeah yeah yeah i coming already she opened the window slightly grudgingly and let the owl in she took the letter from its beak and let it fly around and do its own thing autumn sat on her bed with the letter and flipped it over neatly written across the back of the letter was her name she smiled and quickly opened it hey autumn long time no see want to meet me in front of the potter place tomorrow morning at 10 jason autumn smiled at the letter in her hand and thought must have taken the short way home autumn wrote a reply agreeing and flew it off she then wrapped a towel around her bottom half and walk downstairs to where she found everyone but remus and peter outside in the pool autumn smiled at the teenagers in the pool and tried to make the best of it 88888888888888888 autumn woke up at 7 the next morning without even realizing it it was good for her though because then she had time to dress herself perfectly for when jason was coming the entire night before she fell asleep was spent with autumn not able to get the image of a brown haired tanned boy and she ended up smiling herself to sleep autumn ended up putting on a white tank top and jean shorts she pulled part of her hair back and decided that she looked decent enough walking down the stairs at 10am without being noticed was the hard part where are you going autumn resisted the urge to curse uh for a walk you re going for a lot of walks now a days james said leaning against a sofa i ve only been on one and this ll be my second autumn said in a serious tone so then why are you all dressed up i not dressed up yes you are james teased but autumn ignored his joke and went on being serious look you re not my father and i going out alright autumn said stubbornly james raised his hands in defeat just trying to have a conversation you haventreally been talking to us much james said sounding sorry autumn gave a slight shrug and walked out the front door and met up with jason who had been standing there james peeked outside the door and frowned slightly upon seeing the two but respected her privacy and closed the door what were you planning on doing autumn asked wanting to know where he wanted to take her well there this great muggle park down the road jason suggested autumn grinned alright then let go jason led her to the park that wasntfar away at all and autumn had wondered why james had never taken them there the two of them talked about life and swung on the swings for over an hour until they decided they were hogging the swings and got off they then sat in the grass and talked and laughed like old friends for another half hour you want to head over to my place for lunch my mum would probably be more than delighted to make us lunch jason offered autumn considered for a moment then smiled sure okay jason smiled at her and helped her stand up they walked to his house and laughed about more random things they talked about so he told you the giant squid comes out at night and then you panicked yeah it was pretty funny well scary at the time but funny now autumn chuckled you dontfancy him do you jason asked slightly nervously what james no he was just more of a brotherly figure than anything oh wait was i dontfeel as comfortable around his as i use to right ok we re here jason said not wanting to push the subject anymore and walking onto his driveway and up the stairs of his house autumn nervously walked inside with him and his house seemed safe enough she heard the gentle chopping of someone making food in the kitchen and she smiled as she saw a little boy about 6 years old walk up to her and smile sweetly are you jason new friend she resisted the urge to grab him and hug him to death but instead ruffled his hair slightly and said yes i suppose so mum is making sandwiches i ll go tell her to make another one he said and scampered off to the kitchen he adorable what his name william and while he adorable he can also be a bloody pain it a sibling job autumn smiled and followed him into the kitchen where his mother had just enough sandwiches for them all 8888888888888888 about five hours later autumn was still over at jason house and they were now sitting on the floor of his bedroom playing a simple muggle board game and having fun changing the rules to make their own little game which wasntreally working if i charm the pieces to move by themselves then i d have to take off the charm that causes the dice to roll by themselves because what the fun in the game if we donteven do anything well you could keep both charms and bring the cards that we re supposed to draw back into the game i suppose so he said and reached behind him and grabbed the deck of cards and set it back on the board that better right well in that case i d have to draw a card now jason grinned annnnd i win aww come on you changed the rules in your own favor i wouldntdream of doing such a thing jason said playfully autumn laughed oh fine you win yes i do jason grinned proud of himself autumn giggled oh wow i ve been at your house for over five hours i guess i should probably head back to james place yeah i ll walk you home oh wait autumn took the quill out of the ink and wrote two more lines on a piece of paper marked rules there now you cantchange the rules fine jason said pretending to be serious let go he stood and helped her up 88888888888888888 autumn walked downstairs very late the same night to find james leaning on the armrest of a couch looking into a lit fireplace she took a deep breath and walked up to the back of the couch james why do you have the fireplace lit it the middle of the summer oh hey autumn i was just thinking and i was a little cold okay come sit down he said and brought up his knees so there was room on the couch for her autumn hesitated but figured he didntdeserve her being mean to him she sat down and slouched over looking at the floor james i didntmean to be so rude this morning i just not a morning person that not why you were frustrated with me and you very well know it james said sternly sirius has always been one to leave everything to have a girl for a little while but i should be trusted not to do the same rebecca is a nice person and all but you re my best friend and practically my little sister you donta random girl over family and that what it felt like i was doing fall girl where were you for seven hours yesterday walking around hanging out at the park oh right we have a park down the road dontwe but for seven hours autumn yeah i yeah autumn james scolded fine i met this guy yesterday and he really sweet and he took me to the park and then over to his place james smiled there you go i just figured i d get you to tell me i saw him anyways so what did you two do at his house you spied on us didntyou just for a second but you didntanswer me what did you do at his house his mum made us sandwiches and then we went up in his room i didntask for the sexy details james just kidding love go on and then we sat on his floor and played a muggle board game with our own rules really now yes and he really really cute cuter than me not nearly autumn grinned lied down next to him and hugged him james relaxed and kicked his feet back out probably shouldntfall asleep together as sirius flipped out the last time he saw the two of us asleep on this couch i dontthink he d care honestly james mumbled autumn sighed you re probably right and with that autumn buried her face in james chest and fell asleep awwwww look autumn and james fell asleep together again sniff i think i going to start sobbing uncontrolably just kidding i love james so much maybe i should just screw with your minds and have autumn and james go out woah that would be like siblings going out together ewwwww stop it anywhoo jason baker is basically the definition of hottie he got dark blue eyes in case you were

a friend of mine drew a really good pic of autumn that on autumn myspace disclaimer go bugger yourself chapter 36 where would you go early in july autumn had gone over to jason house almost everyday for what was now almost a month autumn couldnthelp but feel that she and sirius relationship could be easily compared to a rollercoaster good bad good bad etc she was pretty tired of it but she decided the reason she came to james house wasntfor sirius it was for james not to mention to stay away from her own house jamsie autumn called through the mansion she popped her head around the corner and into the kitchen there you are jamsie you should be glad you re you if you were anyone else i would kill you for calling me jamsie james said playfully autumn grin just got wider as she walked into the kitchen whatever you say jamsie i going to jason place okay alright dontstay out too late and dontdo anything i wouldntdo well that depends would you shag someone out of their mind just because you thought they were cute well if i shagged anyone i thought was cute i would have already done you wouldnti james smirked awww jamsie thinks i cuuuute autumn teased at the sound of his nickname james grabbed autumn shoulders from the back and pushed her out of the kitchen laughing get out get out get out dontdo anything i ll lecture you for later james called playfully as autumn left the mansion autumn walked the few miles it took to get to jason house and then walked up the steps of the baker place she reached up to knock on the door but the door swung open before she got a chance i ve been expecting you jason said with a wicked smile are you stalking me autumn smiled maybe he let her in and they walked up to jason room without thinking as they were so use to it d you want to go see a muggle movie tomorrow how do you know about muggle movies autumn asked my mum parents were muggle so she spent the first 11 years of her life doing muggle things like going to the movies right sure you donthappen to know any of the movies that are out do you autumn smiled no idea jason grinned and autumn laughed alright we ll just go and pick a random movie that sounds good to me jason gave her a cheeky grin and then sat on the floor with his back against the wall autumn lied on her back with her legs in the air and resting on his bed so i told you i going to be a 6th year next year and i a gryffindor how about you i know you re going into your 5th year but what house are you in i thought i might have seen you in gryffindor yeah actually i a slytherin autumn said looking at the floor oh you must be that girl everyone was talking about the only muggle born in slytherin eh i suppose that would be me you seem ashamed of it well i dontreally like slytherins at all that probably why you ve seen me in the gryffindor common room before i tend to hang around the marauders and lily and her friends marauders are james friends right yup so are you good friends with lily not really but her and her friends are really nice so we talk every once in a while what about you who do you hang around with at school well i ve mainly got two best friends aaron and bill we re

over there nah can t his parents are muggles and they might freak out if someone appears in their fireplace autumn laughed and sat up from her lying position to sit against the wall next to jason the two of them were silent for a moment lost in their own thoughts interesting no one has been this nice to me other than james and he practically my older brother except he a tad nicer than an older brother would be what you dontconsider me like a brother to you jason teased autumn blushed eh well i didn t she got cut off by jason it ok i dontreally consider you quite like a sister either he said softly and autumn blushed then she yawned tired i not getting much sleep anymore why that jason said looking concerned i dunno my friends are changing a lot and i guess it starting to get to me i staying up at night just thinking i guess oh i hope i not dragging you away from your friends trust me you re saving me from my friends autumn chuckled then leaned against the wall and sighed let change the subject though shall we jason suggested yeah so who d you get your beautiful silky black hair from jason asked autumn smiled at this and answered my mom dad is japanese which makes me japanese i suppose i just got my hair from him thank merlin for your grandpa then and what that suppose to mean autumn said playfully suspicious jason didntanswer he instead stood and helped her up and the two of them spent the rest of the evening laughing with jason little brother while feeding him his first batch of bertie bott s 888888888888888 autumn sat cross legged on a chair in the living room crouching over a new novel she had found in the potter library her eyes frantically read the words on the pages and she didntmove an inch the book she was reading was a horror novel about a guy who fell in love with a woman then the woman randomly killed him when she wrongly thought he cheated on her and afterwards the ghost of the man stalked and killed women brutally currently autumn was scared stiff as she read at night about a particular girl who was walking through an empty house that heard a scraping of something in the room next to her so the girl walked to the room and discovered there was nothing until something quickly moved in front of her and sent a thousand long shards of glass into her body causing her to die a slow and painful death hey someone yelled from behind autumn autumn screamed loudly and fell sideways over the chair she was sitting in to get out of the chair as quickly as possible her heart beating a thousand beats a second autumn scrambled forwards then stood up and turned around sirius she exclaimed angrily i going to kill you autumn launched herself at him and sirius just laughed as he ran away from her james came out of the downstairs bathroom scratching his head lazily and watched autumn chase sirius around the house he was amused for a few minutes until he decided he was bored of it and he waited until they ran by him and he stuck out his foot and tripped sirius over james chuckled and then turned to go upstairs to bed autumn walked over to the vulnerable sirius sitting on the floor and laughed at him sirius stood and crossed his arms you couldnthurt me if you wanted to sirius said with a smug i have before haventi autumn argued hmmm no not really sirius laughed to himself just then rebecca walked out from the kitchen with a confused expression and asked what going on autumn had to force herself not to glare at her and sirius smiled and ran a hand through his hair i scared autumn out of her wits because she a very jumpy person i am not autumn said defensively sure you aren t sirius smiled at autumn then looked back at rebecca were you going to bed yes i was she answered i ll go up with you and without a goodnight rebecca and sirius walked upstairs autumn muttered a jerk then walked upstairs herself and went to bed 888888888888888 autumn walked downstairs in the morning a few days later she was about to turn the corner into the kitchen when she heard sirius whisper yeah i know me too she heard rebecca laugh nervously and they both went silent autumn walked quietly around the corner just in time to see sirius and rebecca lips meet in a passionate kiss wanting to throw up and cry at the same time autumn forgot about the breakfast that she had been planning on getting turned and walked back upstairs on the way back to her room she passed by james he saw autumn solemn face and called after her but she ignored him and closed the door to her room behind her she didntshed a single tear but she instead wrote a brief letter to jason lying to him by saying that she couldntcome over that day because she wanted to finish up her summer homework autumn spent the rest of the hour lying on her bed attempting to shade a piece of parchment from dark in one corner to light in the other corner it didntwork out too well she did eventually though get out of her room and walk down into the kitchen when she finally got hungry enough how re you feeling james asked with a worried face hungry she answered simply and grabbed a sandwich from the middle of the table that james had made them all for lunch here sit down james said pulling out the chair next to him autumn sighed alright and reluctantly sat down so i guessing you know about james started sirius and rebecca yeah i got front row seats you know i actually thought it wouldnthurt when they finally got together i thought i was over it autumn stared off into space i know it hard but i sure she just another fling james said trying to comfort her i dontcare how long it lasts they can get married and have little sirius juniors for all i care autumn said with a straight face you re lying oh i know autumn said dramatically and rested her forehead on the palm of her hand sirius and rebecca came in then hand in hand autumn straightened up in her chair and hurried to finish her sandwich to her dismay the two of them sat down at the table hey autumn haventtalked to you in a while sirius said smiling yeah i wonder why autumn said coldly what sirius asked oh nothing autumn said looking at her sandwich intently so you ll never guess what i did last night sirius grinned changing the subject shagged her brains out autumn said motioning towards rebecca what your problem sirius said loudly to autumn just sharing my thoughts autumn said trying to keep her cool sirius don t rebecca started and james shook his head as sirius stood up angrily look i know you have a problem with the relationship between rebecca and i but quite honestly if you are so madly jealous of rebecca then you can just bugger yourself bugger myself oh how mature autumn stood up herself and who said i have a problem with you and anderson it kind of obvious and vilcent you really need to at least stay far away from the two of us and just leave us alone but i cantask you to leave as it not my house sirius frowned you don t autumn started her voice cracking but ended up just walking out of the kitchen with her heart ripped out and torn in two behind her autumn just barely heard james say something in her defense she slammed the door behind her and lifted her trunk onto her bed and began taking things off hangers in the closet and folding them james opened the door without asking for permission and said autumn you cantleave yes i can james i wouldntbe able to stay here anyways of course you could stay here so sirius is a little mad at you he ll come to his senses a little james he asked me to stay away from him as if i were dangerous james i never wanted sirius to actually hate me so much that he never said he hated you he might as well have autumn frowned and started emptying her drawers look james i sorry and i would stay for you i really would but i dontthink i can see sirius or his new girlfriend anymore james kept on insisting that autumn stay but once she had completely packed he finally gave in and asked well where are you going to stay then i i dontknow james but honestly anywhere would be alright maybe eric place who eric a muggle friend from before i went to hogwarts well how would you get to school i d tell them i needed to be driven to king cross and i dontknow where i going to stay okay in that case i want you to go to the leaky cauldron talk to the person at the counter and when he asks you how old you are say you re sixteen and then if he says you look to young to be sixteen sigh and say everyone tells me that james ruffled up his hair nervously and at least let me give you a few galleons to get through it james i have money i know but i d be able to sleep a bit better at night hold on james ran to his room grabbed five galleons and rushed back and gave them to her james i dontneed and at least stay here one last night alright james whatever you say autumn sighed and james gave her a sad lopsided smile and hugged her tight not letting go for a long time sigh and once again my chapter ends with jamsie and autumn embracing i dontknow if you notice this about me but i really love james especially lately in my story i dunno maybe that just me ah so sirius and autumn are fighting again but this time autumn really is taking it rather seriously he told her to stay away from them and being the ever proud autumn she probably will hint hint i was originally going to post this chapter on may 15th autumn birthday but i couldntwait any longer so i posted this hoping maybe i can get in another chapter by the 15th haha good luck to me so i ve got the ending of this story planned out but it bothers be because a it a pretty sad sending and b the ending is sooooo far away i probably going to end it when sirius goes to azkaban and i not sure if they ll be a sequel yet then again maybe i ll end it when sirius dies or something but the thing is i going to have a really hard time killing james off i just love him that much hug oh and i really hate rebecca anderson if you couldntalready tell right so i made a myspace for autumn it pretty funny and it a way you can better contact me seeing as everyone on earth seems to have a myspace now it on my profile page just click my pen name up there d review away happy birthday autumn disclaimer go um sue someone else or something chapter 37 summer days autumn groggily sat up in her bed at the leaky cauldron she heard yet another tap on her window yeah i coming she said and opened the window to let her owl in it had been only a few days since autumn left james house because of sirius being a jerk autumn sighed as two owls came in at the same time both dropping letters on her bed then one left while her own owl flew around the room autumn walked over and picked up the two letters one was her hogwarts letter and the other was a letter written in jason handwriting she smiled as she opened her hogwarts letter before she got a chance to read the letter a small badge fell out with the letter p on it autumn frowned and wondered why the heck dumbledore would make her the slytherin prefect why would she want to represent slytherin anyways she skimmed over the letter then put it away and took out jason letter autumn haventseen you in a few days are you alright jason autumn sighed yet again and wrote a letter back telling him where she was and briefly told him what happened she then got dressed and pulled out her school textbooks again because she had nothing else to do with her day 888888888888888 around 2 pm the sun was at its peak and autumn wasntable to stand the immense heat anymore and suddenly she wished she could jump in james pool but she settled for a cold drink from downstairs in the leaky cauldron autumn walked to her door and opened it to find jason with his hand raised about to knock the door jason she said bewildered hey he smiled at her what re you doing here the leaky cauldron isntexactly next door to you i couldntvery well let you stay here all summer could i he said raising his eyebrows jason i cantgo back there no but you can come live with me jason suggested i couldn t i barely know your family and what would they say they did say yes i already asked them yeah but i already unpacked and everything autumn said nervously jason peeked into the room really now then why does it look like you unpacked nothing but your textbooks jason grinned autumn looked at the floor obviously caught and cornered with jason persuasive skills but no buts you re coming with me i ll help you pack he let himself in and pulled her hogwarts trunk up onto her bed and opened it up autumn smiled sighed and gave in 888888888888888 autumn and jason sat on the grass at the park and autumn was currently picking at the grass and putting it on jason head while he zoned out into space not realizing she had piled up a grass mound on top of his head jason finally snapped out of his daze and looked over at autumn calmly and said what are you doing she giggled and sat back down nothinnng she laughed and he put his hand up to run a hand through his hair and he pulled down a lump of grass he ruffled all the grass out of his hair and gave autumn an evil grin nothing eh both of them stood up and jason chased autumn around the field she laughed loudly causing all the little kids on the play structure to stop what they were doing and look at them jason chased her until he got her with her back to the fountain and he cornered her until he said what cha gonna do now jason laughed out of breath autumn grinned up at him then grabbed his collar forcefully and pulled him around and into the fountain he made a splash and they heard the little kids in the background cheer in excitement autumn jerked her head towards the kids and blushed slightly at the thought of being watched while acting so immature but while she was turned away jason of course grabbed autumn around the waist and pulled her in backwards on top of him she flipped around as he pushed her further into the water he leaned over her and moved closer to her when autumn whispered there a dozen little kids watching us right now with really disgusted faces i say we move this somewhere else autumn laughed and jason grinned stood up and helped her up i agree jason said playfully grabbed her hand and ran in a random direction for a few minutes until they got lost enough both of them laughed at the excitement and he softly grabbed her shoulders and pressed her back against a tree and kissed her exhilaration spread through their bodies and they only broke apart when the two of them started simultaneously laughing and they slid to the floor hands wrapped around each other kissing 888888888888888 what wrong sirius rebecca asked sweetly as she walked towards sirius who was sitting on the windowsill looking outside with a sullen face he finally dragged his eyes away from outside and his eyes settled on his girlfriend nothing i was just lost in thought is all sirius said and got off of the window sill alright james mom made us sandwiches for lunch rebecca said and sirius just sighed and walked towards the kitchen rebecca stayed back for a second and looked out the window to see exactly what sirius had been looking at her gaze fell upon a kissing couple lying by a tree nearby she shook her head and closed the curtains sad sad cry cry dontworry this story is still a sirius autumn fic now that i totally gave it

jamsie autumn said excitedly and hugged james and he quickly swung her around and set her down haventseen you in a month what have you been up to james grinned behind him sirius rebecca remus and peter talked and jason walked up behind autumn and wrapped his arm around autumn shoulder and pulled her close ah i see what you ve been up to james smiled mischievously and then extended his hand for jason to take as they shook hands and introduced each other james said you ll take care of my fall girl jason raised his eyebrows at the nick name yeah i will jason grinned at james and let go of his hand i d love to stand here and chat but the train leaves in three minutes autumn reminded them ah she right we should get going james said picking up his stuff and running through the platform 888888888888888 i just dontthink i up to it autumn said looking down at her hands folded in her lap i suppose i could find a replacement prefect if you wish dumbledore said leaned back in his chair i think that would be best yes alright i ll try my best thank you sir autumn stood and left dumbledore office autumn found her way through the corridors and ran into jason hey autumn where were you talking to dumbledore about something alright he said not prying you want to go down for lunch yeah sure autumn sighed the two of them walked together to the great hall and sat at the gryffindor table you staying in slytherin again james asked as she sat down yeah autumn shrugged she felt sirius gaze fall upon her from across the table but she ignored it and began to eat how your first day of classes going so far jason asked i like all of my classes so far how about you they re fine he said looking intently into autumn eyes as she looked down at her plate there something bothering you jason frowned nothing bothering me i just had a hard time getting back to my school sleeping schedule alright jason said not wanting to ask more they all finished up their lunches and autumn separated from the rest of the boys to find her next class her eyes fell upon a small girl with light brown hair crossing her arms at a boy that was a few years older than her taunting her autumn walked slightly closer to hear what they were saying i still dontknow why you got put in slytherin mum and dad both thought you were going to hufflepuff does this mean i have to put up with you then the 3rd year boy said to her leave me alone jack she said tears filling up in her eyes i going to be late for class good luck finding your next class jack said sarcastically and left for his next class i know where i going she yelled after him and then looked around where are you headed autumn asked gently potions down those stairs and through that door autumn smiled then walked on 888888888888 autumn walked into her last class of the day herbology and realized it was with the gryffindors she spotted the marauders in one corner and she purposely kept to the opposite side of the room although she felt sirius gaze fall on her again vilcent you really need to at least stay far away from the two of us his words echoed in her head as she found a place to sit down and sighed as she placed her head in her hands she slid her hands off her face and saw that lily had sat next to her how are you feeling lily asked oh yeah i fine autumn looked in front of her and saw lily two friends sitting in front of her so i heard about you and that jason baker fellow congrats thanks autumn said looking at a book she had in front of her you dontseem too happy about i am it just more complicated now that i back in school you know yeah lily said not wanting to pick at the subject any more 888888888888888 a week later in the library james found autumn and silently sat next to her for a few moments doing homework no autumn replied with a book up to her face just reading for the heck of it if you count reading the same sentence fifty times then yes i am reading for the heck of it autumn said setting the book now and not caring if she lost her place james looked at her for a while as if trying to examine her emotions then finally whispered you donthave to get over him you know autumn immediately jerked her gaze to a nearby bookcase who you know who i talking about just give him some time he ll come around james there are so many things wrong with that one is that i ve tried waiting i ve waited forever and i through waiting two is that i ve got a boyfriend james examined her again then changed the subject it quiet without you in our dorm james said solemnly autumn didntanswer him she instead reached into her robes and pulled out a tube of something and handed it to james give this back to sirius for me alright james flipped the tube over in his hand and cracked a small smile he was being such a little flirt remember james pocketed the tube without questioning her about it you re not happy autumn i know why i dontknow autumn said and slouched in her chair yes you do you know very well why you re not happy anymore james frowned and crossed his arms autumn considered for a moment then sighed and said softly you re right i dunno over the summer jason meant everything to me because he saved me from sirius but now that i back in school i see him as more of a best friend than anything else but i dontwant to tell him that yeah i thought so just tell him what you just told me alright alright i ll try autumn said smiling at james who was now standing behind her playing with her hair i cantfigure out how to braid your hair why would you ever need to i dontknow but i sure one day it ll come in handy alright so basically i didntpost for so long because i didntwant to make sense no probably not ok i ll explain i pretty much got my writing skill ego crushed and i

said as he sat down at the gryffindor table he kissed autumn on the cheek and autumn smiled at him it was already mid october as they all sat down to eat breakfast in the great hall so did fall girl sleep in this morning i didntget a chance to tease you about it in class but you know i had to eventually james said grinning oh shut up i slept in once i never sleep in so i have the right to sleep in once donti i suppose so but you know you only slept in because i wasntthere to pour a pitcher of water on your head james you never poured a pitch of water on me head and i was always awake before you autumn raised her eyebrows and smiled of course you woke up before me that just what you want to think james gave her a teasing sort of glare and finished up his breakfast autumn laughed and started to talk with jason half way through breakfast autumn felt sirius gaze in her direction she ignored it until she felt it again she began to stutter in her conversation due to her paranoia until she finally snapped her head around and glared at sirius who was in fact looking in her direction what are you looking at she snapped at sirius oh dontflatter yourself i wasntlooking at you you re so full of autumn started but jason cut her off autumn dontstart something just forget it autumn gave sirius one last death glare then walked out of the great hall acting as calm as she possibly could jason started to stand up but james put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him back down i ll talk to her james said and jason nodded worriedly james followed autumn out but not after shooting sirius a look james found autumn leaning against a wall with an angry expression not to far away from the great hall you need to stop starting arguments with him james said simply autumn calmed down and shrugged how else can i get him to talk to me autumn stared down at the floor what james said shocked autumn didntanswer she instead covered her face with both her hands james walked forward it alright autumn he said comfortingly walked forward and placed a hand on her shoulder but all autumn did in response was collapse in his arms autumn autumn james said trying to see if she was okay but autumn hadntbeen covering her face to hide her tears she had been covering her face because she felt like she was going to pass out and after calling her name out a few more times james knew she had as if by instinct james scooped autumn up and carried her in the direction of the gryffindor common room once he got there he used the spell he had learned a year ago to conjure autumn a bed in the empty area between sirius bed and a wall he laid her down on the bed and stole sirius bed covers to cover her james didntknow what to do the thought of taking her to the hospital wing didnteven cross his mind as he felt he had to take care of this himself ten minutes after james had brought her up to their dorm autumn woke up she slowly sat up and looked around the room why d you bring me here she asked james shrugged i guess i was just looking for an excuse to bring you back james said and autumn looked at him and smiled what time is it she asked first class starts in two minutes oh no autumn said as she struggled to get out from under the covers no no no you re staying right here i d say you have a good enough excuse to not going to class today i cantskip the whole day oh yes you can and you and i are doing to be lazy and not go to class all day james said excitedly you re insane and you love me for it james grinned back at her autumn smiled slightly under her scowl and james reached forward and put his hand on her forehead plus you have a fever no i don t what are you my mother she laughed in a sense yes but alas no i couldntbe a mother as i am a man james laughed at his own joke now james what have i told you about the marauders never becoming men aw you admit we re men all the time james grinned what i wouldntever say you all are men you re a bunch of little screaming boys autumn raised her eyebrows you use to call sirius a girly man did you not james said with a grin still plastered to his face autumn playfully glared at him aw shut up autumn admitted defeat so what could we do all day without getting caught autumn gave an over dramatic playful wink and nudge ooooh you make it sound dirty james wiggled his eyebrows and autumn laughed well how bout i show you our secret butterbeer stash james suggested and autumn gasped but you haventeven told remus and peter where you keep it all autumn said shocked james shrugged they never really pushed the subject james laughed and helped autumn up 888888888888888 autumn finished her third bottle of butterbeer and laughed at james who had already gone through 5 bottles they were both sitting on autumn bed having fun drinking part of the marauder stash of butterbeer seriously this time you should get to bed now you re still sick and you need sleep james told autumn and she just stuck her tongue out at him make me autumn grinned fine then james said what ll you have to do but sleep if i leave and lock you in you wontlock me in autumn said and james grinned at the challenge watch me james stood up and ran towards the door autumn didnteven bother getting up you re not going to do it you donthave the heart to lock little ol me in here autumn yelled out at him still smiling when james went silent she stood up and walked to the door she tried to open it and found it locked what let me out right now potter she yelled but the only reply she got was a soft laughter in the common room she banged on the door for a few more minutes then gave up and sat on her bed sulking 888888888888888 sirius threw a quaffle at james and james caught it easily they were sitting in the common room right after james had locked autumn in their dorm so would you like to explain to us why you werentin any classes all day sirius said crossing his arms james passed the quaffle from one had to the other lazily well i decided to skip classes james said truthfully why peter asked uhh i felt like it james gave them a funny smile right i not buying it remus said and sirius raised his eyebrows at james james chucked the quaffle back at sirius and as sirius caught it remus suggested they all go to bed yeah i pretty drained i ll probably head up you three coming sirius asked uhhh no you dontwant to go to bed james said as peter and remus both stood up to go up to their dorms why not sirius asked because sleeping is for wimps that why james gave a fake grin jamsie you re an idiot let just go to bed sirius laughed yeah alright james said nervously they headed up to their dorms but before sirius could open the door james thought fast and casted a quick silencio spell on sirius sirius didntnotice so he opened the door and walked in she sleeping and she sick so leave her alone james tried to explain to sirius but sirius was just mouthing something angrily at him i not going to take the spell off until you calm yourself james stated and waited sirius sat on his bed with a silent huff and glared at autumn sleeping form on the floor in front of her newly created bed she held one of james text books in her hands and it looked like it didnttake her very long to fall asleep james walked over to autumn and picked her up off the floor she softly grunted but allowed james to tuck her into her bed he then turned around and took the silencing spell of sirius why d you let her come up here sirius whispered and james shrugged she passed out and she had a fever james explained so take her to the hospital wing then sirius said irritably no i like her here and if you have a problem with that take her to the hospital wing yourself james crossed his arms fine she can stay but just tonight sirius sighed and walked into the bathroom 888888888888888 sirius was lying in bed after all the lights were off looking at autumn in the bed next to his he watched as she tossed and turned obviously having a fever dream if he were still good friends with autumn like he had been not so long ago he would shake her awake and ask if she was okay but now he felt all he could do was watch as tears began to fall onto her pillow i didntknow it was possible to cry while you re asleep sirius thought to himself but he knew something was definitely wrong when he saw autumn roll onto her back and start gasping for air he sighed and swung his legs out from under the covers then walked over to autumn bed hey hey get up he said sitting on the side of her bed and shaking her shoulder he tried again and this time autumn snapped her eyes open she stared at sirius for a few seconds as her pupils shrank you you re alive autumn said her voice shaking seems like it sirius replied you were breathing abnorm sirius started but autumn cut him off by reaching forward and hugging him gently sirius sat there shocked for a few seconds then hugged her back you must have had some heck of a dream huh i sorry autumn said letting go of sirius for what for judging your relationships it not any of my business who you date sirius shrugged i didntmean it when i told you to stay away from me i guess i was just being sirius sighed girl crazy girl obsessed autumn suggested sure that sirius gave a small smile they both sat in silence for a moment until sirius said i ll be right back sirius stood and it was at that moment that autumn realized he didnthave a shirt on she blushed and looked away as he pulled on a dark blue shirt he calmly walked out of the dorm autumn was too tired to wonder why the heck sirius randomly left the dorm so she turned over and tried to get back to sleep a little less than an hour later the door to their dorm opened and autumn turned over to see sirius walk in yawning he walked over to autumn bed and casually climbed under her covers autumn didntquestion why but she smiled as he put an arm around her as if she were a stuffed animal she buried her face into his chest and fell asleep so it mid summer now and i already dreading school as i said before i actually kind of like the chapter especially the ending with sirius and his dark blue shirt yes chelsi i did that purposely so everyone having fun this summer hope so i sure am although i am very tired at the moment i swam today after like a month of not swimming and let me tell you swimming is nothing like

die without you guys yey ch 40 already i so proud of myself enjoy chapter 40 the sirius black package autumn slowly awoke to an annoying repetitive clicking sound she groaned in frustration and felt something move against her she opened one eye to see that her face was in sirius torso she backed away and sat up quickly her heart beating fast good morning sunshine autumn heard james say she looked over and saw james grinning his face off she scowled at him blushed and tried to slide out of bed but realized one of her legs were caught in between sirius legs she shook sirius shoulder slightly and he rolled over letting go of her leg she sighed and slipped out from under the covers only to be caught around the waist and pulled back onto the bed by sirius followed by a couple more annoying clicks where are you going sirius grumbled to class sirius let go of autumn and rubbed his eyes it a saturday autumn sirius smiled autumn blinked stupidly for a few seconds oh james what are you grinning at she asked james held up a camera and waved it taunting her sirius didntsee james as his back was to him sirius was lying down looking up at a sitting autumn and smiling autumn finally caught his gaze and raised her eyebrows in amusement how is it that you and i can fight and you win my friendship over within a few short hours autumn asked causing sirius to grin it comes in the sirius black package i guess sirius black package my arse my package is your arse now isntthat a tad suggestive sirius grinned autumn smacked him in the arm and walked away from him to the bathroom to brush her teeth any of you idiots out there know how to conjure a toothbrush and toothpaste no james answered you couldntpossibly be talking to me i not the idiot sirius retorted but no i dontknow how ask moony over there he seems to have woken up remus conjured a toothbrush and toothpaste and threw them at sirius hitting him in the head sirius ignored this and handed them to autumn after fifteen minutes or so autumn came out of the bathroom showered and ready for the day hey bozo your turn in the shower autumn grinned at sirius obviously in a very good mood what a bozo sirius asked standing up to walk to the bathroom it what you are autumn smirked and sirius shrugged and went to take a shower autumn walked towards the door to the common room where are you going james asked lying on his bed taking pictures of himself with his camera out of boredom autumn placed her hand on the door handle and turned to james waiting for sirius to close the door to the bathroom and whispered you know sirius is going to come out with a towel wrapped around his lower half and you know i canttake that kind of torture autumn smiled slightly james laughed and turned the camera to take a picture of autumn blushing remus snorted and covered his face with his hands his shoulders shaking with laughter oh be quiet autumn said blushing harder james smirked at her and motioned with his finger for her to come to him autumn rolled his eyes and walked over james grabbed his wand from the bedside table and autumn raised her eyebrows slightly worried james pointed the wand to autumn head and magically dried her hair there you go james said and tugged on a lock of hair wait i want to get a picture what are you camera obsessed suddenly yes deal with it stand over there james said pointing slightly to the right of where autumn was already standing autumn slid over a bit and james smiled there you go now smile autumn crossed her arms pouted and then stuck her tongue out and laughed you and your stupid camera got pictures of you snuggling with sirius so you cantblame me too much james grinned evilly we werent snuggling we were sleeping james raised his eyebrows and remus looked over at them you were snuggling remus said bluntly hey guys there no towel in here is autumn still out there sirius shouted from inside the bathroom and autumn quickly opened her mouth but james threw his hand out and tightly covered her mouth no she went down to the common room james called back doing everything in his power not to laugh autumn struggled furiously but james just pulled her onto his bed and held her mouth tighter mate i think you re killing her emotionally and physically remus whispered smiling nah she can breathe with her nose james whispered back and sirius walked out autumn tightly closed her eyes and struggled to turn away from where sirius was standing you said she left sirius said stupidly walking over to james bed and grabbed the towel autumn had been using wrapping it around his bottom half alright autumn i apologize he decent now james said letting go of autumn mouth autumn cautiously opened her eyes and blushed a deep red when she saw sirius with just a towel on again put some clothes on autumn protested why i rather like the towel only fashion besides i like it when you blush sirius grinned flashing her all of his teeth sirius mate i ve been meaning to ask you what that thing you ve been keeping on your dresser sirius turned what thing sirius asked and james pushed autumn off of himself and quickly crawled forward james what are you autumn started and james grabbed the towel on sirius and yanked it off hey sirius yelled and autumn turned her head scrunching up her face in disgust sorry i couldnthelp it autumn was blushing too hard james laughed sirius snatched the towel back from him and quickly threw it around his waist james you evil little murtlap autumn smacked james in the arm mer what james said smirking he pulled out his camera and flashed another picture of her that a nice picture i think i ll frame it autumn smacked james in the back of the head and sirius couldnthelp but chuckle at the whole ordeal using me for your own sick entertainment james i never knew you were so interested in seeing me naked all these years and i actually thought you liked lily sirius laughed and james tackled him with pillows in his hands autumn rolled her eyes letting them have their little sissy fight she stood up and walked towards the door remus make sure james and the girly man dontkill themselves she said turning the handle and getting hit in the back of the head with a pillow sent by sirius she laughed and threw it back at him quickly leaving the dorm before he could throw another pillow at her hey she heard someone call from inside the dorm james came running out you feeling better no fever i dontthink i have a fever i feel fine honestly alright james smirked now thank me for getting sirius naked in front of you you pervert she yelled shoving him back into the dorm and closing the door walking down to the common room with the distinct sound of james laughter getting softer as she walked down the stairs when autumn reached the bottom of the stairs and faced the common room the first thing she noticed was a red headed girl sitting on a couch smirking at her over a book autumn raised her eyebrows at her and lily just laughed you know any girl who goes in and comes out of the marauder dorm with the same clothes on will get questioned lily smiled and motioned for autumn to sit down autumn complied and tried to explain herself i was just i had a fever and james is so protective erm lily eyes went wide so you and potter no james is like my older brother that sick autumn scrunched up her nose i suppose that makes sense i always thought you and sirius would make a better couple i mean once he matures a bit if that possible lily bookmarked her book and put it away autumn blushed slightly and chuckled if sirius can mature so can james autumn said trying to warm lily up to james uhg potter i know it not possible for him to mature you never know right autumn tried lily shrugged dismissing the subject and stood up you want to go down to get lunch with me lunch oh i suppose we slept in a bit yeah alright autumn smiled at the invitation when the two of them entered the great hall the first thing that they saw was jason jogging towards them he came up to autumn grabbed her around the waist and whisked her around softly setting her back on the floor well you re sure in a good mood autumn smiled at jason and he grinned back at her yes i am did you sleep through breakfast he asked and autumn simply nodded she grabbed his hand and led him back to the gryffindor table with lily following close behind as soon as they all took a seat the marauders burst into the room your school mischief purveyors have arrived sirius yelled happily strutting towards their table the distinct sound of a crying girl was heard in the distance sirius sat across from autumn and james followed him sitting across from lily grinning at her sirius looked at autumn then at jason who was smiling and his face fell slightly realizing autumn hadntbroken it off with jason like he expected her to good morning all james said flashing a grin to autumn and lily well it was a good morning lily sighed yes i know right when i decided to sit across from you it became a wonderful morning james said arrogantly lily rolled her eyes and autumn kicked james under the table giving him a look james just shrugged you sure you feeling better james asked autumn taking a bite out a sandwich yes james i fine were you sick jason asked worriedly no i just had a small fever it gone now she saw sirius roll his eyes out of the corner of her eye but she chose to ignore it so are you going to hogsmeade with me tomorrow jason asked and autumn fumbled with her hands under the table yeah okay autumn said and jason smiled and you and i could find a dress for the halloween dance lily gave her a friendly smile oh i forgot there was going to be a halloween dance this year yeah but it less formal than last year ball lily said and autumn nodded the marauders zoned out their girly talk and started going on about what they would do the next day at hogsmeade when lunch was finished lily joined her two best friends and autumn walked behind the marauders holding hands with jason autumn stopped and let the marauders walk in front of them a bit i going to head off to the library i ll meet you back in your common room i know the password already autumn told jason softly and he nodded kissing her on the cheek letting go of her hand and let her walk in the opposite direction autumn walked straight to the library and began combing the shelves for a book to help her on the potions essay she was suppose to have done by wednesday she stepped back from a shelf and looked up spotting the book she needed it was just conveniently out of her reach she stood on her toes and reached for it but another hand got it before she could she turned around and watched as sirius handed the book to her you re pretty short sirius gave a weak smile well compared to you autumn crossed her arms over the potions book i broke it off with rebecca last night that what i left for autumn immediately looked at the floor but looked back up at him and asked why she smart and so danged pretty sirius shrugged you re smarter he said casually he lowered his face down to hers and whispered in her ear and definitely prettier he said breathing on her neck she shuddered slightly and couldntquite find her voice to answer him i i autumn said at a loss for words i broke it off with her for you he said simply and she backed into the shelf behind her he slowly lowered his lips so that they were just centimeters apart from hers buahahahaha i feel so bad for jason but i have something in store for him hahahaha yup so i made it

and definitely prettier he said breathing on her neck she shuddered slightly and couldntquite find her voice to answer him i i autumn said at a loss for words i broke it off with her for you he said simply and she backed into the shelf behind her he slowly lowered his lips so that they were just centimeters apart from hers autumn gasped slightly dropping her book and lifted her shaking arms to his chest to signal for him to stop sirius i jason she said still not quite able to speak well you re blushing and that got to be a good sign for later sirius backed away slightly and grinned autumn was shocked how could he still be so cocky after she just rejected him sirius winked at her and moved to walk away autumn mind immediately snapped back into motion hey she said grabbing the collar of his shirt and span him around pushing him roughly against the bookshelf where she had been moments before a few books fell off the shelf i never knew you liked it so rough sirius laughed you did that purposely did what led me on even though you knew i had a boyfriend what your problem you just love playing with girls hearts dontyou autumn said not letting go of his shirt sirius frowned solemnly you donthonestly think that do you he said quietly yes i do autumn said lowering her voice a bit sirius sighed and unclenched autumn fist so he could move i dontdo it purposely he said avoiding her gaze autumn eyes glistened with the beginnings of tears but you still do it autumn said her voice dangerously close to cracking sirius leaned a hand against the shelves and looked at the floor i not trying to play with your heart sirius clenched his teeth there was an awkward pause until autumn said look sirius jason is my boyfriend and i very happy this way he a great guy and i sorry you missed all your chances with me but you and i cantbe together we got back on a friends basis and i d like to keep it at a friends relationship alright autumn crossed her arms yeah alright sirius said softly then see you tomorrow at hogsmeade then autumn just nodded sirius picked up her book handed it to her and left the library autumn leaned back against the shelf took a few deep breaths then walked slowly out of the library herself she headed to the gryffindor common room where she said she told jason she would meet him after her trip to the library after giving the portrait the password and entering the common room she noticed jason sitting on a couch leaning forward with his hands clasped together upon seeing autumn he jumped up and grinned hey i ve been waiting for you jason said happily and autumn smiled back at him sorry this little book here was annoyingly hard to find she lied d you want to go for a walk with me jason asked now yeah now unless you no now is good i was just asking autumn chuckled slightly and took his hand as he led her out onto the hogwarts grounds they walked by the lake for a bit in silence until jason spoke up so i haventproperly asked you do you want to go to the dance with me jason said blushing slightly you donteven have to ask of course i will autumn grinned and i not going to force you to endure the pain and torture of sitting in a dress shop while lily and i pick out our dresses so go get dress robes or candy or something alright autumn said jason laughed yeah alright your dress can be a surprise for the dance huh jason looked over at autumn sure autumn said smiling it kind of chilly we should head back in dontwant to catch a cold the day before a hogsmeade trip and it only six days until the dance so getting sick isntan option autumn said and jason chuckled they walked slowly holding hands they stopped on the way back at a bench by a big tree and autumn turned to face jason she gave a little fake curtsy and jason bowed slightly taking her hand and kissing it he led her up onto the bench so she was standing on it autumn laughed as jason grinned evilly at her and grabbed her around the waist swinging her around and setting her back on the floor kissing her soundly on the lips you know what jason asked happily what i think i might love you jason grinned down at her and autumn tried to seem happy as words were caught in her throat she suddenly felt awkwardly guilty to avoid having to answer autumn reached up and grabbed the back of his neck pulling him down to kiss her the tension of that moment faded away and the two of them walked back inside while talking and laughing they walked in the corridors for a while until autumn said well i ve got to get back to my own common room but i ll see you tomorrow alright alright jason smiled and kissed her one more time before heading in the opposite direction to the gryffindor common room autumn grinned and practically skipped to the slytherin common room but before she could even say the password someone covered her eyes from behind guess who hmmm it either professor mcgonagall or james potter autumn smiled as james took his hands off her eyes you didnthonestly think you were sleeping in there did you well i autumn started but a randomly appearing sirius interrupted her no no no you re staying with us sirius said as james picked autumn up and slung her over his shoulder wait at least let me pack my stuff autumn protested but sirius grinned already taken care of you raided my stuff again autumn said shocked as james carried her away from the slytherin common room yup and let me tell you those new panties you got are not what i pictured a modest girl like you wearing sirius grinned autumn tried to smack him in the head but james swerved her in the opposite direction not letting her get close enough to do so autumn was secretly relieved that sirius was back to his old perverted self she had almost laughed when he cracked a joke about her underwear and when james finally dropped her on her bed in their dorm autumn was in a very good mood 888888888888888 lily wasntall that surprised when autumn came down from the boy dorms the next morning and jason didntseem to have a problem with it as if he had known all along once in hogsmeade the marauders and jason went off in one direction and lily her two friends and autumn went off in another to get their dresses the dress picking didnttake all that long and all four of the girls were very happy with their selections they walked out of the store with their dresses and met the boys in the hogs head where they had already gotten themselves 5 butterbeers the girls ordered for themselves and joined jason and the marauders you girls all pick out your dresses james said trying to act civil around lily yup one of lily friends said can i see jason joked and reached for the bag with autumn dress in it autumn slapped his hand away no it a surprise remember autumn smiled and jason gave a mock sigh i suppose i ll just have to wait he said leaning over and quickly kissing autumn on the cheek they all went into their own conversations until the marauders had all finished their drinks let head over to zonko s you girls want to come james asked them standing up they all nodded eagerly and left the hog head filing out of the pub karli and bonnie both immediately started walking alongside sirius and talking rapidly with him laughing at every slightly funny thing sirius said neither of lily friends were purposely hitting on sirius but come on this is siriuswe re talking about autumn mentally glared at the pair of flirtatious girls but stayed behind them a bit with jason in hand jason looked sideways at autumn and smirked at her hmmm seems lily friends are attacking black with their fluttering eyelashes autumn turned to jason and laughed at his comment you noticed too autumn said grinning oh it hard not to he said then stopped walking abruptly and held autumn arm letting the rest of the crew get ahead of them autumn looked questioning at jason but jason just kept smiling and leaned in to kiss her he kissed her once twice three times then kissed her on the nose and moved back slightly so that he could look into her eyes he likes you you know what autumn asked taken aback but his sudden comment it seemed a bit weird to her that he would kiss his girlfriend then tell her someone else fancied her sirius isntit obvious no what did you not hear anything i told you over the summer him and i haventever actually had the best relationship ever autumn frowned slightly and jason just shrugged it the way he looks at you he does it all the time when you re not looking looking out of the corner of his eye as if he were a child looking at a cookie he isntallowed to have a cookie autumn said trying to brighten the mood jason broke a grin you see this is why i love you you can turn the most awkward moments into the happiest moments jason wrapped his arms around autumn waist and looked down at her happily d you know what autumn said calmly what i love you too she said almost forgetting to blink when he looked down at her then kissed her again softly on the lips and pulled away to say good i was beginning to think i was alone jason grabbed autumn hand and pulled her in to kiss her harder than he ever had before they only broke apart when they heard a girl shout something at the top of her lungs about letting go jason and autumn walked back into public view holding hands and looked up where sirius remus james and lily stood facing a single cloaked character the cloaked person had its wand held out threateningly pointed at james autumn immediately released jason hand and ran as fast as she could towards the scene please donthurt him he done nothing honestly lily said from a few feet behind james sirius whipped out his wand and remus followed his example as soon as autumn reached james she threw her arms protectively around him putting herself between james and the figure get off him the man said angrily expelliarmus the man wand flew out of his wand unexpectedly and jason came jogging up his wand in hand pointed at the cloaked man the man laughed as his wand magically flew back into his hand and he pointed his wand at jason don t autumn started letting go of james and focusing her attention on jason she pulled out her wand don t hurt him the man didnteven turn to look at autumn he flicked his wand and jason wand was shot out of his hand leaving him pretty much defenseless stop it autumn said demandingly taking out her wand if you wish the man said and she could almost hear the sarcastic grin in his voice he turned quickly to autumn shot a spell at her and she fell to the floor screaming the man then turned back around as jason walked towards autumn and he raised his wand at jason again the cloaked figure perked up and looked over jason shoulder and cursed as he saw a group of teachers rushing towards them autumn stopped screaming in agony with a few short gasps and tried to crawl over to where her wand had gone when she fell she grabbed her wand and looked up at jason trying without success to get up the man looked back over at jason shooting a jet of green light at him then apparated quickly just as soon as dumbledore came into sight are you alright sirius asked helping autumn up from the floor yes autumn gasped painfully jason she said looking from jason on the floor to dumbledore who was bent over him looking up at autumn is he alright did he get stunned dumbledore shook his head silently and moved a stand of hair out of jason face with a wrinkled finger what wrong with him everyone but autumn seemed to know what was going on and she suddenly felt very confused james bent down and hugged her shoulder from behind slightly and said autumn let go no i want to take jason to the hospital wing he passed out autumn he not passed out yes he is autumn said shaking off james grasp on her shoulders and crawling forward to jason who still laid there still she ran a hand through his hair the strands of hair that had been tucked behind her ear fell in front of her face and she slowly bent over and put her face in jason chest a silence fell over the group around jason and autumn and it was only after over five minutes that james bent down and held autumn shoulders to get her to realize how long they had been there autumn jumped at the contact and james slowly picked autumn off jason and autumn didntfight back too hard jason slid out of her arms and she stood up sirius quickly rushing to hold her up so she wouldntcollapse no one said anything on their trip back to hogwarts 888888888888888 i cantfind her sirius said to james walking into their dorm peter had fallen asleep on the floor by his bed remus sat on his bed leaning against the head post with his eyes drooping closed james looked up from his sulking position and shrugged she wontdo anything stupid she probably just wants time alone how do you know she wontdo something stupid her boyfriend just died and i cantfind her anywhere did you check in the hospital wing they re keeping jason there and his parents are coming over good point sirius said turning to leave sirius why dontyou just check the map james said pulling the marauder map out of his pocket and holding it out letting sirius grab it from him why didntyou give this to me earlier i ve been searching for hours she fine she probably smashing things in the unused classroom she is in a few floors down james said calmly as sirius opened and activated the map searching frantically with his eyes finding out that autumn was in fact a few floors down you already checked how are you so calm sirius asked james angrily i trust her james shrugged and sirius left the dorm he dashed through the corridors map held tightly in hand and by the time he reached the room the map said autumn was in he was out of breath he opened the door quickly and saw autumn sitting on the floor in the middle of the unused classroom looking up at him with a sorrowful tear stricken face sirius walked over to her slowly catching his breath and bent over wiping her tears he sat close to her and directed his eyes towards autumn arms which were folded in her lap he quickly grabbed her wrists and flipped them over examining the smooth underside of her forearms he sighed a breath of relief and hugged her wordlessly sirius pulled away and finally looked around the room they were in james was right sirius said softly examining the broken fragments of assorted objects scattered across the floor he took out his wand and repaired a broken vase and swooshed it back onto the table where it had probably been autumn not taking her eyes off sirius curled into a ball and casually flicked her wand making the vase shatter onto the floor again do you want to head back to the common room with me sirius asked softly autumn shook her head and buried her face in her knees sirius cautiously put a hand on her shoulder and she didntmove he took the opportunity and hugged her it ll be alright he whispered in a comforting voice autumn brought her body out of the curled up position she was in and rested her head on his chest tears leaking out of her eyes and dampening his shirt autumn heard sirius take a sharp breath and only then did she realize that he had started tearing up himself sirius brought autumn closer to himself and softly placed his head on her shoulder their embrace lasted a few minutes until sirius lifted his head and casually wiped his tears with his sleeve he leaned back slightly and tilted autumn chin up with his fingers wiping the tears from her cheeks with the other sleeve let get out of here sirius whispered and stood up slowly offering her his hand i ll carry you if you want autumn shook her head in response and pushed herself off the floor stumbling i think i d feel safer if you got on my back actually sirius bent over and pointed to his back autumn grudgingly got on and sirius straightened up holding her legs in place as she wrapped her arms around his neck and he walked slowly towards the common room autumn dozed off on sirius back a few times but she was awake when they arrived at the common room sirius set autumn carefully on a couch by the fireplace and slumped next to her obviously exhausted himself autumn fell asleep and her head dropped onto sirius shoulder sirius sighed and placed a hand on the other side of her head keeping her close to him yes well um how do i explain this chapter how about like this jason was planned to be killed since a few days after i created him kind of sad actually i liked him but it had to happen i sorry sirius is a sweetie isnthe so i haventupdated because i am now a sophmore in high school and as easy as that may sound i taking college level classes which they for some reason allow sophmores to take idiots well basically ap us history is the hardest thing i ve ever done and math is equally as frustrating so i hope you all understand my procrastinating this chapter i mean my not having time to post this chapter and lastly i almost at 100 000 words which was my new years resolution which means the next chapter will be very short because i want my story to be exactly 100 000 words at one point just for the heck of it please dontget frustrated with me and i hope some of you are still reading even though you are probably very confused as far as my plot goes review review review o snowflake prongsette o 100 000 words i accomplished my 2006 new year resolution 2 5 hours before midnight on december 31st yeah more in the end notes but here ch 42 have fun chapter 42 healing autumn slowly came out of her current daze her eyes focused on the ceiling above her bed she slowly sat up and tried to figure out what had caused her to come out of her wonderful sleepy daze she turned her head to her right and jumped as she saw a hand reach out at her come on we have to go eat sirius said and autumn looked disbelievingly up at him sirius paused and waited for the answer that did not come dontmake me carry you sirius said frowning and crossing his arms autumn stared blankly at him for a few seconds then laid back down turned away from him and pulled the covers up to her chin you leave me with no choice then sirius sniffed and roughly ripped the comforter out of autumn grasp and off of her body sending the cold wave of october bitter weather onto her body she shivered but just curled herself into a ball and refused to move sirius stood and waited for a little bit then sighed and rudely swooped her up into his arms and proceeded to carry her out of the boy dorm out of gryffindor and down a few flights of stairs after a few flights of stairs and many raised eyebrows in their direction autumn finally realized that sirius was carrying her she started to fight against his hold sirius ignored her struggles and took her outside rather than taking her to the great hall to get food he walked calmly as if autumn werentstruggling to get free then he abruptly stopped you need to wake up sirius said as autumn tried to figure out where he had taken her but before she could gather her surroundings sirius had let go of her and she suddenly found herself submerged in the freezing cold water of the great lake the shock sunk into every nerve of autumn body and she broke the surface of the water to breathe sirius helped her up by her shoulders and watched in amusement as she stood shivering in the chilly climate w what was that f for autumn managed to ask through the chattering of her teeth sirius shrugged how else was i going to get you to stop acting like such a zombie autumn stood soaking wet hunched over with her arms crossed glaring at sirius they stared at each other for a while a small smile on sirius face alright let go before you die out here sirius said and walked behind her grabbing her shoulders and forcing her to walk towards the castle they made it all the way back into the gryffindor boy dorm and sirius held autumn by the shoulders tightly wordlessly telling her to stay there he walked into the bathroom turned the shower on and tested the water with his hand he left the bathroom with the shower still running and grabbed autumn who by this time had her lips turning a funny shade of blue sirius picked autumn up momentarily and placed her standing up and fully clothed in the hot shower he had prepared sirius picked up autumn shampoo bottle from under the sink and held the bottle out for her to take she stared at the bottle refusing to take it from him sirius shrugged opened the bottle himself and poured some of it out on her head and when she didntmove he moved forward and mussed the shampoo into her hair sloppily the halloween ball dance is today sirius said having fun as he played with the shampoo in her hair autumn turned to face sirius and raised her eyebrows up at him so so you re going with me of course i am autumn said sarcastically you are i know for a fact that you have nothing better to do sirius grinned down at her and she frowned pushing sirius hand away from her hair and lathering the shampoo in herself sirius watched her for a little while and then spoke up again so is that a yes no i will not go autumn said her face directly being pounded with water from the shower so as to not have to face sirius and also to rinse the shampoo out of her hair why not what on earth would make you think i would want to go to a dance well we all figured you need a little cheering up i don t autumn protested and sirius handed her conditioner for her hair you do autumn put a little bit of the conditioner in her hair combed it out with her fingers and then shook her head i dontwant to now get out so i can properly shower autumn commanded sirius replied with a small grin i can stay for that no you can t autumn said shoving sirius in the direction of the door and muttering pervert sirius chuckled and left the bathroom walking over to the dresser to change his pants which were wet at the bottoms from walking into the lake himself he then spied into james trunk as the rest of the marauders were all in their last day of classes for the week sirius immediately spotted james precious camera and took it out of his trunk and onto his bed he fiddled around with the camera for a while waiting for autumn to come out from taking her shower he found a little red button and nosily pressed it before he could blink a stack of rectangular pictures appeared on the bed next to the camera sirius smiled at his accomplishment picked up the pictures and started looking through them autumn walked out awkwardly with a towel wrapped around herself i didntgrab dry clothes to wear and i guessing you didnttrust me to pick out clothes for you sirius said looking up from the photos nope dontworry i ll be quick autumn said wanting to go back in the bathroom and get dressed as quickly as possible oh trust me i dontmind sirius grinned jokingly and autumn shot him a deathly glare i raided james trunk and got some pictures from his camera really autumn said suddenly interested she grabbed her clothes and walked over to sit next to sirius so she could see the pictures herself suddenly not caring that she only had a towel around herself she watched as sirius slowly flipped through the pictures let see most of them are james being a creepy stalker and taking pictures of lily i shocked he doesnthave any pictures of her naked autumn scrunched her nose and hey when did prongs ever take this sirius said suddenly grinning mischievously autumn blushed beet red it was the picture she knew james had taken when she and james had tied sirius up and dressed him up like a girl but this particular picture was taken when james had said he was going into the bathroom to dampen a towel when he was really conjuring his camera and then coming out of the bathroom just in time to take a rather raunchy picture of autumn practically sitting on sirius knee snogging him pretty passionately seeing the picture made autumn cringe knowing sirius never knew james took the picture sirius just laughed i remember this did you know he took a picture maybe alright yes remember that present james gave me for my birthday the one i refused to let you see yes sirius said and autumn stood up and walked over to her trunk rummaged through it and pulled out a picture frame she walked over and handed it to him and he laughed same picture autumn said blushing she left the picture on the bed and grabbed her clothes walking into the bathroom to change when she came out sirius had the pictures in separate piles all over the bed he looked up at her and smiled i organized them seriously autumn said and walked over to the pictures again and sat down on the bed yup see this pile is all of lily and her friends this pile is james taking stupid pictures of himself this pile is any of the marauders including myself this one is you and the last pile is you and me autumn grinned and picked up the pile that james took of himself she flipped through the 30 or so pictures and couldntcontain her laughter jamsie is one weird guy pick your favorites i think i ll frame a few of these liiike this one yes this one is definitely going to be framed sirius grinned holding up a picture let me see autumn said reaching over and snatching the photo out of his hands she sniffed at the picture of herself that she was holding it was when james decided to restrain her when sirius came out of the shower without anything on she had blushed so hard and james thought it would be funny to snap a picture of her in all her tomato face glory you will not frame this i will sirius said snatching the picture back from her and setting it aside autumn set the pictures of james down and picked up the pictures of both sirius and herself she flipped through the pictures quickly turning red again james had a little bit too much fun taking pictures of us together sirius said calmly i can tell i think i ll frame this one as well sirius said holding the picture back for autumn to see it was one of herself refusing to pose for the camera like james had insisted but instead crossing her arms frowning and sticking her tongue out the two of them spent some time flipping through the pictures some more until sirius announced that the rest of the boys would be getting out of classes did you skip classes today autumn gasped yes sirius said simply and smiled autumn scrunched her nose and gathered up the rest of the pictures into a pile and handed them to sirius thank you this did definitely cheer me up a lot i know sirius said overconfidently but i still cantbelieve you threw me in the lake autumn complained and i still cantbelieve you haventeaten all day sirius said mocking her let go get food for you shall we i suppose so autumn sighed and allowed sirius to lead her to the kitchens and get some food for her growling stomach sirius smiled at autumn from across the small table they were sharing in the kitchens what re you looking at autumn smiled at sirius sirius took a few more moments then answered with you ll heal i was originally going to calculate this chapter out so that it words would make my story exactly 100 000 words but then i decided against it i had too much to write having 100 000 words was my original 2006 resolution and i really excited about actually accomplishing it sorry if the camera pictures portions was a bit long i just had a bit too much fun with the different pictures also there will be a much more in depth healing process for autumn in the next chapter and then some more on the halloween ball thing happy new years review lots o snowflake prongsette o it tgnms 2 year anniversary as in 2 years since i posted the first chapter of this story wow so here a little chapter in celebration chapter 43 mind numbing autumn bit her lip impatiently fumbling with her fingers she looked at her feet and tried to compose herself as she waited she heard movement inside the classroom she was waiting outside of and she perked up almost jittery james finally walked out of his last class and spotted autumn waiting for him right outside the classroom she launched herself at him and wrapped her arms around him he hugged her back as he picked her up and moved her out of the way of other students trying to get out of class you re sure eager to see me how re you feeling james asked setting autumn down and looking at her with pure concern in his eyes i alright as of now but i dont like being alone and sirius left me autumn answered the truth was that since jason died a few nights previously she went into full mode depression where she refused to get out of bed and refused to talk to anyone it wasntuntil sirius dropped her in the great lake that she came out of her trance but since then autumn tried to completely block the memories of jason from her mind her mind went numb trying to forget and all she could think about was not being alone for a second i should have guessed that why padfoot was in none of his classes i also going to assume he is going to try and force you to go to the halloween dance tonight he going to try yes autumn smiled are you going to give in to his pressure james teased probably eventually the dance is in five or six hours and i dontwant all of you to go without me good james said and started walking knowing autumn would follow you are going right autumn asked him yes james said simply are you going with someone autumn probed again yes who are you going with then james kept walking not answering her question for a few strides well you refused to get out of bed james started and autumn cringed slightly and i actually got up the courage to you have to understand i couldnthave told you right away james what all happened when i wasntaround um sirius made the quidditch team james grinned but autumn stomach fell now both her best friends would be off at quidditch practice non stop what position beater wow quidditch games just got a little more exciting is he any good i d say he amazing for a beginner james teased you re veering away from the point who d you ask to the dance ummm i sort of asked lily to the dance and she agreed well yes james said shyly and autumn attacked him in a hug stopping him from walking any further i so proud of you autumn said smothering him we have to go get you ready you ve got to look sharp for lily well what about you so do you james said trying anything to get the attention off himself autumn let go of james and laughed i dont even have my dress anymore i dropped it in hogsmeade actually oh james what did you do autumn sighed well we figured if you didntgo we would drag you so the two of us sirius and i got you a dress please tell me sirius didntpick it out autumn pleaded so you ll wear it james smiled hopefully do i have a choice nope fine then autumn said as they reached the gryffindor common room immediately upon walking into the room sirius walked up to the two of them grinning and handed james his dress robes so are you going sirius said ecstatically well i dont really think i have a ch autumn started but got cut off good then let go get you ready sirius grabbed her arm enthusiastically and pulled her up to the boy dorm when they arrived sirius grabbed a dress of her bed and ran it back over to autumn handing the dress to her so you heard about james and lily autumn asked taking the red dress from him yup ahh you should ve seen the hard time we gave him his face turned the brightest red i ve ever seen sirius laughed and autumn smiled you re evil i know go put it on already sirius begged and pushed her in the direction of the bathroom autumn smiled and walked into the bathroom closing the door behind her her smile faded entirely as she leaned against the closed door and sighed how could she possibly be able to go through a whole night trying to be cheerful but despite herself she changed quickly into the dress she examined herself in the mirror and managed to smile it was obvious james and sirius had fought over a dress for a while she knew this because james would try to find a dress for her that was modest enough that she would agree to wear it and sirius would try to find a dress that showed off as much skin as possible the dress she was currently wearing happened to be right in between the dress went down to her knees but had a slit on the side that went half way up her thigh and the neck of the dress had loose fabric that swooped nicely and didntshow too much the only part she considered complaining about was the fact that the dress was mostly made of silk she heard a knock on the door you done yet i getting bored you re impatient autumn said unlocking and opening the door maybe just anxious sirius said scanning her body with his eyes sirius autumn said and his eyes snapped back up to her eyes sirius who re you going with you really that a first autumn said looking down at her bare feet sirius i not so sure i can do this autumn said with a sigh why not sirius frowned well one of the last things i said to him was that he couldntsee my dress until the dance and he never autumn cut herself off before her voice began to crack sirius stepped forward and hugged her i have something for you sirius said almost regretfully and pushed away from autumn walking over to the dresser bending over and pulling out the bottom drawer he carefully pulled out something that sparkled in the light sirius held it up for autumn to get a good look at and she was shocked in realization that the thing he was holding was the black dress autumn had bought for herself for the halloween party we werent going to give it back to you for a while because we thought it would hurt too much but if you wanted to wear it tonight then you could sirius said nervously awaiting her reaction autumn just stood and stared at the dress with tears filling up her eyes i told him he had to wait to see it on me oh jeeze i sorry autumn sirius said and with the dress still in his hand he stepped forward and hugged her tightly she put her face in his shoulder but didntcry thank you though autumn mumbled so do you want to wear it sirius asked hesitantly and autumn silently shook her head against his body do you still want to go sirius took a step back from her and held her shoulders autumn looked up at him and nodded solemnly i guess i d just rather be surrounded by you guys than my bed sheets autumn smiled and sirius fought to hold in a smile autumn crossed her arms what she asked cracking a smile sirius finally gave in and grinned i for one would rather be surrounded by your bed sheets sirius laughed and autumn smacked him in the side of the head that disgusting autumn exclaimed and sirius shrugged you made it too easy i couldnthelp myself sirius said and autumn shook her head amused by his playfulness shouldntyou get ready it only a little over an hour until the dance mmm i guess i ll go shower or something fix your hair in the meantime sirius sighed and headed towards the bathroom ruffling autumn hair on the way oh no you don t autumn said quickly grabbing sirius shoulder causing him to stop what you re taking clothes to change into while you re in there why cant stand to see my ripped body sirius bragged grinning james chose this moment to walk into the dorm having obviously heard this conversation no she cant stand to see you with just a towel on why do you think she blushes so hard whenever you do james said nonchalantly and sat on his bed autumn grabbed a pillow and threw it at james face so the first chapter of the girl not meant for slytherin was posted exactly 2 years ago wow i was a loser back then but then werentwe all i know i promised the dance this chapter but i had to post tonight so that the update date and the first post date looked snazzy next chapter i promise laugh note autumn and sirius are complete flirts even when her boyfriend died hah review lots i love you guys o snowflake prongsette o it been over a month here you go chapter 44 just a tad autumn and sirius were both completely ready for the halloween ball and they were both seated in the common room waiting for james remus lily and karli who were all still getting ready in the half hour they had left autumn reached over and began twirling sirius hair in fingers we overestimated our time didntwe autumn asked sirius calmly yeah we did can you imagine how excited james is for his first dance with lily sirius said closing his eyes and smiling they re cute autumn said and sirius nodded in agreement sirius autumn asked still playing with his hair mmm do you believe in heaven she asked and sirius opened his eyes to look at her yes i think so autumn looked at her lap and ran her hand through the back of sirius hair do you he asked her i not sure she sighed and sirius gave her a sad meaningful look autumn twisted a lock of sirius hair and looked up as james came down the stairs she smiled as she slid her hand out of sirius hair and stood up to properly see james aww jamsie you re cute autumn said admiringly brushing off james shoulder and sirius snorted behind her why thank you and you re still looking gorgeous james said back to her and sirius stood up behind autumn he wrapped his arms around her waist from behind her and pulled her onto his lap on the couch they had been sitting on and simply said mine i am not yours autumn said relaxing in his lap sirius shook his head disagreeing tonight you re mine autumn shrugged to this and james smiled at the two of them james autumn said getting james attention and motioning towards the stairs where lily and her friends were coming down james flashed autumn one last excited grin and then ran off to greet lily you think that little bugger finally got her sirius said his arms still wrapped around autumn waist mmm probably not but it doesnthurt to give him a little bit of hope lily does like him she just doesntknow it yet autumn sighed true should we head down to the great hall now sure autumn said reluctantly getting off his lap and pulling sirius up with her remus walked down and only had to wait a few moments before karli came down from her dorm also james lily sirius autumn remus and karli walked down towards the great hall happily half way there autumn turned to sirius and smiled thank you for waking me up autumn said are you kidding i couldntmiss the chance to throw you in a lake sirius grinned and autumn laughed the six of them walked into the great hall greeted by poorly attempted halloween decorations and music that was turned up a little too loud sirius shouted something at autumn but the only thing she could pick up was the word dance autumn nodded at sirius and the two of them walked to the middle of the dance floor where many couples were already forming a clump of people after sirius and autumn had both wordlessly declared they needed a break they took to the side of the great hall where a few tables were set up the two of them sat down and autumn attempted to say something but her words were drowned out by the blaring music a slower song switched on and autumn sighed in relief the music is a tad loud isntit oh just a tad sirius said sarcastically rubbing his ears in pain they stared at each other for a very long moment as if to share their thoughts silently sirius smiled knowing exactly how autumn felt would you like to go back to the common room with me sirius said oh yes autumn said eagerly with a sigh they both immediately stood up and headed for the doors ignoring james and remus staring at the two leaving they quickly walked out the doors and through the halls autumn started laughing sirius quickly joined in that was terrible autumn exclaimed slowing down her pace i didntthink i could get out fast enough my ears are still ringing sirius said scrunching up his face in distaste you know actually i think the party was alright i think we just both didnt want to be there autumn said thoughtfully maybe sirius shrugged they walked quickly into the gryffindor common room and then straight up to the boys dorm autumn kicked off her shoes and collapsed on her bed she smiled and watched sirius take his jacket and shoes off to lie on his own bed i think james may have been annoying lily a bit autumn mentioned and sirius laughed maybe we should have helped them huh sirius said and autumn sighed oh well the two of them were silent and autumn closed her eyes basking in the quiet she eventually turned to face sirius and opened her eyes and sirius was staring back at her sadly funeral is tomorrow autumn said sadly her eyes stinging slightly where somewhere in london i think she said wondering if she had to tell dumbledore or not do you want me to go with you sirius asked comfortingly yes autumn said simply rolling back onto her back alright sirius said not taking his worried eyes off of her he sat up and walked over to her bed he sat on autumn bed bent over and gathered her in his arms they hugged each other and autumn relaxed a bit sirius autumn asked softly yeah sirius said still holding her close to him i lied to jason what sirius said pulling back from autumn a bit so he could see her face the day he d i told him i loved him and autumn drifted off into her own world tears spilling down her cheeks and i did like him i really did but i knew i didntlove him the way he loved me i never did and i didntknow what else to say he died with my lie implanted in his mind i cantbelieve i could autumn tried to say more but her words were drowned out by her jerking sobs she cursed out loud as she attempted to compose herself sirius rubbed her back and began to talk hoping it might calm her down a bit the way you re crying right now it reminds me of a long time ago do you remember when you woke up in the middle of nowhere and stumbled into our dorm and passed out you had been missing about four days and i didnt know what to do with myself i actually cried for you i dont usually cry at all i caught james crying once too while you were gone you ve got to admit sirius said smiling down at autumn you ve got a way of softening us up sirius pushed part of autumn hair out of her face you guys seriously cried autumn asked slightly amused now yeah i pretty much bawled my eyes out i mean come on we thought you had died sirius said sadly and autumn stared at him until she finally cracked a smile what a wuss autumn said mockingly and laughed sirius grinned and laughed at himself do you want to change out of your dress or something then you could probably fall asleep more comfortably autumn shrugged broke out of sirius arms and rolled off the other side of the bed she got up and walked over to the dresser she pulled out her basic pajamas and turned to sirius i too lazy to go into the bathroom to change so just look away okay autumn said to sirius waiting for him to turn away okay sirius said not moving that would require you looking away sirius autumn said smiling knowing he wouldntturn away at the opportunity to watch her undress hmmm no i dontthink i ll look away i guess you re just going to have to strip for me sirius grinned innocently autumn sniffed and walked into the bathroom closing and locking the door i can see you through the door sirius called towards her jokingly sicko autumn called out from inside the bathroom but sirius heard her stumble around nervously she changed quickly and threw her shirt at sirius playfully annoyed sirius laughed and threw the shirt lazily on her own bed he held out his arms to her and she smiled and climbed into his arms like a little child would in their dad arms what time is it autumn asked and sirius shrugged it probably about ten but i dontexpect james and remus to be getting back anytime soon peter will eventually come up from the common room unless he fell asleep there autumn said and she felt sirius shrug against her back there was a silence between them in which both of them fell into their own thoughts and when autumn spoke up she spoke in a soft voice so you made the quidditch team autumn asked and sirius grinned yes i did i made beater and i heard you re amazing for a beginner autumn mocked for a beginner i amazing for a pro sirius said sitting up straighter mmm i sure you are autumn said with a sigh shall we taunt james about lily until the day he dies sirius laughed and stood up setting autumn onto her feet he threw back the blanket on autumn bed picked her up and laid her down on her bed pulling the covers over her body he smiled down at her and chuckled again yes we shall poke james about his little obsession with lily until the end of time oh poor james and yes autumn is a tad depressed and maybe even a little mood swingy or a lot but after the funeral autumn will be right back on track huge ap finals coming up i fear for my life and the lives of the other students in my class oh my i know i going to fail i very sorry for the delay and i promise promise promise i will make up for the delays over the summer as for now review o snowflake prongsette o i absolutely apologize i thought this chapter would be posted a few days ago i also apologize for the fact that i haventbeen able to answer many reviewers this particular chapter goes out to siriuslylikefanfic because she brightened my day with her review enjoy chapter 46 speechless autumn finally finished unpacking her things into one of the rooms of james mansion she hurried into james room where sirius already was and sat on james bed it was already getting dark and james parents had just left for word sirius thought it to be very important that they start drinking the firewhiskey immediately they passed a bottle around until autumn decided just to keep it for herself and sirius opened a second bottle i feel rebellious autumn said and placed the firewhiskey down to lie down herself it a good thing your parents work night shifts otherwise how could we get away with anything sirius laughed took another swig out of the bottle and passed it to james outstretched hand a half hour later autumn gave the rest of the bottle to sirius and smiled i think i drunk you cantbe drunk you ve had barely anything to drink sirius laughed and took the bottle well i ve never had firewhiskey before i probably don t tolerance autumn asked confused no it doesntseem you have any tolerance at all james smirked and looked at sirius for his reaction to the situation sirius just grinned stupidly at autumn autumn laid herself down on the floor and closed her eyes you probably shouldntfall asleep without having a cup of water or something sirius said in an amused tone you guys get drunk all the time i bet autumn grumbled no not really james answered stood up and headed downstairs to grab a cup of water for autumn once james was gone sirius held his arms out as an open invitation for autumn to collapse into his arms she crawled over and did so slouching against his chest in a very sloppy manner we should go to the park and have a chocolate feast autumn giggled what why sirius asked and autumn shrugged against him have you never had a drink of anything before butterbeer autumn replied and sirius laughed crap we re the terrible kids who got innocent little autumn drunk i really not all that autumn began but then got too confused and lost her train of thought james came back with the cup of water and handed it to a dazed autumn who took it spilled a bit tried to drink it spilled more and then was assisted by sirius and finally succeeded in drinking the water she then fell asleep 888888888888888 james autumn called through the halls of james mansion jamsie james poked his head out of the kitchen and frowned at her what did i say about the name jamsie that i could call you it whenever i wanted to autumn smiled innocently and james just shook his head and smiled at her whatta you want i got a letter that isntaddressed to anyone and it doesntlook like it was meant for me so i thought maybe it was supposed to go to your parents or something autumn said handing james a folded up piece of parchment james wiped the powdered sugar off his hands onto his pants and grabbed the letter he opened it and read it out loud it seems you ve gotten through to them they ll be informing you soon of your place here james frowned yeah that sounds ministry like to me i ll be sure and give it to them when they get home why hellloooo sirius said walking into the kitchen and poking autumn in the sides from behind autumn squeaked in surprise and smacked his arm sirius ignored her action and walked directly to the table with the powdered doughnuts to collect one for himself and what re we doing today no idea are you eating that for breakfast autumn motioned towards the powdered doughnut sirius held sirius stuffed the rest of the doughnut into his mouth well unless you want to make breakfast i much too lazy to have anything but this for breakfast sirius said and swallowed james ignoring their conversation suggested that they finish preparing for christmas an idea that was quickly shattered by sirius extreme laziness i was actually thinking about stopping by the baker place to see how jason parents and little brother are doing autumn said and james raised his eyebrows wontthat bring back memories for them and maybe make it harder james asked and autumn shrugged probably but i really want to see little will i miss him and now he an only child with two depressed parents he probably doesnthave all that much fun well alright and you can bring him over here if he wants to james said and smiled sirius seemed to have completely zoned autumn and james out and had been staring at autumn for the past three minutes he eventually walked up to autumn and tilted his head slightly are you alright autumn asked and sirius reached up and stroked her check with the back of his fingers autumn stood shocked and dumbfounded while sirius smiled what are you doing autumn asked hoping to get sirius to come out his creepy trance your face looked really soft and i wanted to see if it was sirius walked out of the kitchen leaving a speechless autumn what the hell was that autumn exclaimed jerking her attention to james who stood there with a big dumb grin on his face aw you two are adorable together i hate you jamsie autumn walked out of the kitchen herself and left the house to walk to the baker place after grabbing a warm jacket and scarf she walked briskly down the road to jason house and stopped for a moment when she reached it autumn stood up straight facing the house and gathered her thoughts before finally walking up to the door and knocked after autumn almost gave up on anyone answering the door the door opened slowly and will stood looking up at her with one small hand grasping the doorknob autumn he asked in a voice that sounded much too mature for his 6 or 7 year old body hi will how are you autumn asked and will just shrugged and let her inside she looked around for a second nothing had changed physically at all but the mood the feeling inside the house had changed drastically before jason and autumn would walk into this house together greeted by a chirpy little brother and an over enthusiastic mother now all she could see was an unhealthily depressed child and parents not to be found there was no sandwich on the table waiting for them and there was no urge in autumn to rush upstairs to jason room everything felt dead are your parents home autumn looked down at will will nodded shortly they re upstairs autumn bent down slightly to more directly speak with him and said would you like to come over to where i staying sirius and james are there and we ve got a whole bunch of fun things we could all do together will stared at her blankly for a moment i dontknow if mum and dad ll let me but i ll go ask them he walked up the stairs with a slight clumsiness and autumn mulled about waiting for him to come back down it didnttake long for him to come back and when he did he said mum says its alright if i go over for the day but she says to come back before dark good now would you like to arrive in piggy back fashion autumn asked and will cracked a smile and nodded will grabbed a jacket for himself and they headed out the door as they walked or rather as autumn walked with will on her back will was almost completely silent autumn figured this was because he had gotten so used to his house being quiet and depressing she knew will understood what was going on and she could sense his maturity had spiked to unnatural levels after jason died autumn opened then kicked the front door to james house open and shouted sirius jamsie i come bearing presents almost immediately at the mention of presents the two boys had come walking into view why hello william we ve heard loads about you james grinned down at william whom autumn had put down on the floor sirius bent over slightly and shook will hand in a very manly handshake how d you do i sirius black would you care to join me in a game of tag will grinned at this suggestion alright but who it hmm sirius thought out loud and inched his way over to autumn autumn is sirius quickly tapped her on the arm and bolted out of sight will quickly ran in the same direction sirius had and james sprinted in the other direction autumn sighed and chased after the three rather excited boys this was more a filler chapter than anything but i really excited about introducing a new friend into autumn life dontworry i promise i wontkill him off like i did jason i was also really happy to make autumn get drunk i laughed oh and that letter she got is more important than it seems i going on a little vacation so i taking a week or so off writing but then i ll be back on track writing as fast as ever as always please leave your thoughts in a review o snowflake prongsette o this chapter goes out to kerry chelsi and freckles x kerry because she still reads my story loyally chelsi because she is amazing and blonde and freckles x because her comment made me smile it brightened up my whole summer thank you guys warning i really really like this chapter and you know what that means things get kinda hot no sex dontworry i just joking around chapter 47 uncomfortable sirius flopped down on to his bed gracefully and peered over at autumn who was fiddling with her christmas presents which were obtained a week previous autumn sensed his presence and turned to meet his gaze sirius rubbed his eye you know it polite to use gifts that you receive as soon as possible you just want to see me in nothing but a bath robe autumn smirked well yes sirius said simply and chuckled lightly to himself turning to lie on his back autumn was silent for a moment then said christmas was oddly calm this year wasntit yes i suppose it was sirius twirled his hair in his fingers i wonder why autumn was silent for a while and when a chill ran down her spine she gratefully put on the bath robe she had received from sirius for christmas she pulled the robe tighter around herself and looked at the floor you know it kind of feels like i in the eye of a great hurricane like everything happened at once and then none of it mattered anymore because the worst is yet to come sirius gazed at her wordlessly then unwrapped a wrapped candy from his nightstand and popped it into his mouth well sirius said moving the candy into his cheek so he could properly speak let just hope this eye lasts through tonight huh jamsie and i were planning on getting you completely plastered for new year s autumn just gave him a look and sirius shrugged innocently we only have an hour how long do you think it ll take you to get ready for the party um twenty minutes probably as usual it ll be a bunch of people from the ministry mostly pureblood so i wouldntgo around flaunting the whole muggleborn thing if i were you sirius said and watched as autumn nodded at his comment autumn looked up at the ceiling and it was rather silent until they heard a bang and a few clattering sounds they jumped up and quickly ran downstairs to meet remus who had flooed into the potter manor remus was enveloped in a massive group hug moony how have you been james exclaimed clapping his friend on the back i ve been alright remus said flattening his hair i going to go and quickly take a shower but when i come back we can all catch up i ve missed you remus autumn said grinning and backing out of the room to go upstairs remus nodded and allowed her to go take her shower 888888888888888 autumn walked out of her bathroom in her new bathrobe and curled up on her bed exhausted by the heat of the shower there was a knock on her door and she groaned who is it the sexiest man alive can i come in no autumn said with closed eyes sirius opened the door silently walked in and looked at autumn curled up form are you sick sirius said and walked towards her autumn jumped and sat up covering herself even though she didntneed to i said you couldntcome in i not dressed sirius shrugged you should already know that when you tell me i cantcome in i do anyways well then why do you even ask autumn frowned to sound polite sirius said nonchalantly and wrapped his arms around her waist autumn looked up at him this is extremely uncomfortable here i ll make it more uncomfortable for you there are only two or three layers of clothing between our naked bodies right now i could just rip off your robe and your skin would be completely bare in front of me he dropped his voice to a whisper and then i could have my way with you uhg sirius that disgusting is it sirius bent down slightly and slowly licked autumn cheek with the tip of his tongue autumn wiped her cheek on the shoulder of her robe and scrunched up her nose was that supposed to be hot yes i suppose it just my natural dog instincts sirius grinned so do other dogs think you re sexy when you lick them autumn raised and eyebrow and smiled sirius dropped his voice to a low mock seductive voice and said oh baby you re the only dog i ll ever lick autumn laughed and struggled slightly to get out of his hold but sirius held on tightly sirius really i need to change autumn whined and sirius finally let go fine i ll leave but you know you want me oh yes terribly take me now auutmn said sarcastically and sirius face brightened up really no get out autumn tried to act angry but ended up stifling a laugh as she said it sirius held up his hands in defense and slowly walked out like if he walked slow enough he might be able to see her undress but autumn locked the door and quickly changed into her rather plain flowly knee length black dress putting a light black jacket over it she used a hair drying spell brushed it stuck a headband in it then bounded down the hall into sirius room autumn knocked eagerly on sirius door yes are you fully clothed autumn asked yes sirius answered and autumn opened the door sirius stood grinning in front of her in only his boxers autumn ran to him and jumped curling her legs around his waist i knew you were going to lie before i even asked autumn said giddily what are you so excited about sirius asked putting his arms around her keeping her there it new year s yes yes it is but i hate to break it to you it not a holiday in which you get mounds of presents sirius frowned slightly i know autumn said and sirius lowered his body towards the bed and pried autumn arms and legs off himself so she would lie on the bed while he was free from her hold i need to get dressed too you know sirius said pulling his very black pants on then his white button up and coat what colour tie sirius asked ah dontwear a tie i dontthink anyone will expect you to be too formal alright sirius unbuttoned the top two buttons of his white shirt autumn mood leveled out as she sat watching sirius dress and she smiled at him and he joined her on the bed sirius rested on his elbow and wrapped his other arm around autumn pulling her closer to him i going to assume without any confidence that you already know how i feel about you well and you re alright now sirius dropped his voice yes then why on earth are we not together sirius asked autumn adjusted her body so that she could face him we re not together because every time we hit a point together where i think we could be together you run away and get another girl or we get into some sort of fight autumn answered i like it better this way i don t sirius said softly sorry autumn said looking down and fiddled with the bottom of sirius shirt her hand made its way under his shirt and up onto the skin of his stomach her fingers searched for the scar she gave him below his belly button ah you really probably shouldnttouch me like that sirius said nervously autumn withdrew her hand and snorted in laughter you know you actually gave me a scar before i gave you a scar really sirius said intrigued yes autumn said sliding off her light jacket and pointing to jagged scar that appeared on the back of her left shoulder it weird that i never noticed that there when and how did you get it he asked it was a few years ago when we got detention you pinned me to the ground and kissed me and through the adrenaline rush i didntnotice you were pinning me and moving me against a sharp rock autumn laughed kinky sirius said with a smile but then caught autumn eye oh sorry but i guess we re even scar for scar uh huh maybe we should go downstairs or something the guests will be arriving soon and i promised remus we could catch up autumn moved out of sirius hold and stood up fiiine sirius said and they both headed downstairs for the party that was soon to begin 888888888888888 the punch was not spiked this year must to autumn amazement james parents had made sure of that however as every other year all four marauders peter showed up a after sirius and autumn came downstairs and autumn went upstairs to celebrate the changing of the year in james room here of course they did have a modest supply of firewhiskey d you think slughorn will assign anything on the first day we get back he likes to do that yes yes he will autumn said in reply to remus who was currently lying face up on the floor two minutes guys sirius sat up straight and took one last swig of firewhiskey before setting it down to watch the clock the clock ticked down and sirius grinned at autumn what re you looking at autumn asked slightly peeved you re gorgeous sirius replied with his goofy grin and you re drunk yes i am sirius said eleven seconds ten peter started and they began counting down autumn noticed that sirius wouldntstop staring at her she tried to ignore it and failed terribly right before the one of the countdown was shouted autumn smiled back at him and said damn you hah autumn is a silly billy short chapter i know sorry but water polo season starts tomorrow so i am going to be swamped i tried to get some chapters up this summer to make up for the school year it didntwork to well so anyways i ll keep posting as much as possible i really into the plot right now and i very excited to have them all go back to school i have some things planned please review it really brightens up my day to see that people read o snowflake prongsette o this chapter came out a bit longer than usual and since i ve been doing dedications this chapter is dedicated to bad fairy because she stuck with this story for so long and she awesome p and to my old history teacher who taught me history teachers donthave to be boring and dumb chapter 48 hazel eyes autumn walked out of slughorn potion class only half awake i dontthink i ve ever been so tired in a class in my life autumn said rubbing her eyes well at least you were in class i amazed we were able to get you up this morning the banging of drawers and shouting about showers didntseem to stir you at all james smirked no but the all of you jumping on my bed screaming bloody murder tactic sure seemed to work autumn said scrunching her face up at the memory just barely sirius said they continued down the corridor towards the great hall for lunch they reached the gryffindor table sat down in their usual seats and while the boys started eating autumn put her head in her arms and tried to get a few minutes rest she had almost fallen asleep when something poked her on the shoulder she grudgingly brought her head out of her arms and turned around a slytherin 7th year boy with black hair and hazel eyes was standing behind her rather stiffly he eyed the boys around autumn and cleared his throat do you think i could speak to you privately he said gazing back down at autumn no james and sirius answered at the same time for her the slytherin ignored the two marauders and waited for autumn answer what for it a rather private matter he replied still not moving autumn raised her eyebrows at this comment do you think it could wait i afraid i not quite awake at the moment and i might not be able to process whatever it is you need to tell me autumn stifled a yawn for effect alright but i ll be needing to speak with you in the very near future and with that the slytherin walked straight out of the great hall suddenly awake and with wide eyes autumn turned to face the marauders again what the hell autumn grinned at the strangeness of the previous scene do you suppose he wanted to take you to hogsmeade or something james said very amused what was with the formality sirius asked with a raised eyebrow it was probably from the way he was raised you know with a huge manor and snobby pure blood parents remus answered with a smile you know moony it rather sounded like you were describing my life james said with mock anger yes but i would never call your parents snobby remus took a bite out of something in order to avoid further interrogation he looked really really familiar i feel like i ve known him forever sirius said frowning yeah i kinda get that too it probably just because he been around school james said shrugging i really dontthink i want to find out what he wants to talk to me about he kind of gives me the creeps and i know i ve seen him around there has to be some reason we all think we know him autumn sighed as she felt a wave of fatigue sweep over her again and she resumed her previous attempt at sleeping with her head in her arms 888888888888888 autumn fiddled with her fingers on her desk as her charms teacher went on about something or another it was her last class of the day and it couldnthave gone by any slower a group of ravenclaw girls were sniggering behind her and she felt greatly self conscious as if she were the center of their amusement she hunched her shoulders over slightly and pretended to be very interested by the nearly completely chipped gold polish on her nails autumn heart pounded and her face turned red as she eagerly awaited the end of class one girl behind her muffled a snort with her hand and autumn heard a slight bang of the desk class was finally let out and autumn frowned as she turned to face the girls one of the ravenclaw girls followed autumn with her eyes and said hello you re autumn arentyou autumn resisted the urge to glare at them and answered simply yes arentyou a slytherin yes then why on earth do you spend all of your time in the gryffindor boy dorm the ravenclaw girl finally grinned so that what this was all about they thought she was some sleazy whore who shacked up with the marauders we re all pretty good friends and if you find that you canthandle your jealously then you can just take it up with them yourself autumn walked out of the room wanting very much to find either james or sirius and hide behind them for the rest of the day luckily sirius was waiting for her outside the classroom the ravenclaw girls promptly shut up upon seeing him autumn walked around sirius and basically hid behind him until the girls were out of sight you re seriously hiding behind me since when do you hide sirius asked smiling at autumn you know i never realized how odd it was that i ve been sleeping in the same dorm as a bunch of boys for what a year now doesntthat kind of make me look like a autumn was cut off no sirius said bluntly so autumn couldntfinish her sentence autumn sighed and sirius grabbed her hand in his and began walking oh are we at the holding hands phase of our relationship autumn said with a slight smile lightening up the mood relationship really sirius said excited no it was just a autumn said confused we re not together well technically we are together arentwe sirius said but didntlet go of her hand autumn laughed james snuck up behind the two of them and then in a low voice said sexual tensiooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn sirius and autumn immediately released hands and glared at james james shrugged and walked between them someone had to make it a little more awkward for the two of you and who better to do it but the amazing mr james potter james grinned autumn felt suddenly tense again as she spotted a group of older slytherins walking towards them her instincts screamed danger but as they passed by they just smiled at her and walked by as if they had been friends with autumn since the beginning autumn felt shaken up she didnteven acknowledge the fact that remus and peter had joined the group of boys next to her did they just smile at you in a non mocking way sirius asked as shocked as she was i think so did i do something amazing to the slytherins that i dontremember autumn said her voice slightly panicky i dontthink so unless you were drugged james suggested which is highly unlikely remus said well how else autumn started but noticed the 7th year slytherin boy from earlier in the great gall walk towards them autumn slowed down as she approached them and the whole group eventually came to a halt the boy gazed over at the boys and then looked back down at autumn do you have a moment now he asked calmly autumn tried to get her jumbled brain in order enough to find an excuse not to but found herself telling the marauders to continue on without her i suppose so autumn said nervously and the boy led her to the side of the corridor so as to not be in the way i think you ll find what i need to tell you is of great importance and i think afterwards you ll agree this needs to remain a secret do you think we could take this into an unused classroom he said and autumn stared at him i dontknow if i know you well enough to trust you autumn said twisting her hands around i promise i wontharm you in any way he said and autumn sighed alright but this canttake too long or my friends will be worried it won t he said and led her into a nearby classroom he shut the door behind them and turned to her i suppose you ve heard of mr vilcent recent death he said still very calm and autumn stared at him confused what oh i suppose we would have heard of it first he died of apparent liver failure over winter break the boy said and autumn just stood in shock the boy cleared his throat i know this will all be very hard to hear but my parents oh i suppose our parents gave you up about a year after our mother gave birth to you it been a very prominent trait in our blood that within the first year of life a major magical even happens to them this wasntthe case with you however and my parents placed you in muggle care for fear of being discovered of having a squib but when you got your hogwarts acceptance letter everything went wrong the boy looked down at his feet his calm front finally being slightly let down you were sorted into slytherin as a muggle born and the reputation you built for yourself wasnta good one you made friends with gryffindor blood traitors and went your own way our parents werentplanning on ever revealing your true blood but we must now place you into different care as you are our responsibility now our parents have graciously offered you a spot back in our manor at least until you graduate and they have told me to inform them of your decision he finished waiting for an answer from autumn it took autumn a few moments to realize she was still conscious and standing upright she tried to soak in what he was telling her and she didnthave much of a hard time believing it this did explain why he looked so familiar to all of them his eyes and hair were exactly the same as hers the way his cheekbones were placed and the shape of his chin were similar to autumn as well she also couldnthelp but feel like she finally had some kind of reason why a muggle born like herself was placed in slytherin autumn realized the boy was still waiting for a reply so she answered i have a place to stay at the moment so it wontbe necessary the boy shrugged alright but it was my duty to inform you he said and began to leave what your name autumn said through her daze vincent jackson he said before leaving autumn in the classroom alone autumn stood in silence for a moment but then walked out calmly and headed towards the gryffindor common room all four marauders waited for her in the common room by the fireplace they looked to be in some sort of quiet argument until autumn walked in autumn went and sat by them in one of the chairs and slid deep into her own thoughts autumn are you alright what exactly happened james said being the first to speak autumn looked up from the fireplace slightly my father is dead oh james said and it became silent again is that all he said sirius asked autumn paused for a moment and nodded autumn decided that she would eventually tell them that her birth family wasntwho she grew up with she would eventually tell them that her being put in slytherin wasnta complete fluke who was he remus asked vincent jackson autumn replied she secretly added the surname to her own name and had to suppress a shudder how could she never know that the vilcent werenther real family it never even crossed her mind she vaguely remembered her mother telling her that the reason her hair was so black was because her grandfather was japanese now she wondered if it were true at all she never met her grandfather and she had no reason to doubt her words i ve heard of the jackson s my parents work with them in the ministry i think i dontknow what department they work in though james sighed and looked at the floor did you figure out why he looked so familiar to all of us do we know him at all remus asked leaning back further in his chair no i didntfigure out why he looked so familiar i have no idea what we all know him from i figure it because he was one of those slytherin jerks walking around all the time autumn lied actually you know i think i do know where i know him from sirius started i pretty sure he was one of those kids who bumped into me in the hall and threatened you it was right after you disappeared for a few days d you think he had something to do with that maybe i still have no memory of that week or so that i was gone i just remember something about the marauder map and then i remember waking up and forcing myself to walk to the gryffindor common room autumn felt all awkward again because she couldntbring herself to remember ah those were not good days james said and sirius nodded in agreement i have a headache i think i going to tuck in early tonight autumn said pressing her right temple she wasntlying either the lack of sleep mixed with the density of the information she was given didntwork well with her head she trudged up to the boys dorm but half way up sirius caught her arm and turned her around autumn what going on sirius asked gently autumn weaved her fingers into her hair and tried to think of an appropriate answer i just found out my dad died autumn said and dropped her hands to her sides oh oh no i sorry how did it happen sirius sighed well i think it was some sort of organ failure i haventseen him in so long he might have had a disease for months and i would have no idea there was a moment of silence between them where both of them tried to figure out how to react sirius finally let down his guard by putting his hand on the back of autumn head and pulling her towards him in a comforting hug autumn didnthesitate at all in burying her face in his chest and wrapping her arms around him i suppose we should get our own flat soon huh autumn said her words slightly muffled mmhmm sirius said releasing her from his tight hold autumn avoided his eye contact and stared at the floor instead i really do actually have a headache though and i actually do want to go to bed early tonight autumn said quietly but didntmove sirius watched as small tear slid down one of her eyes he put his hands on either side of her face and wiped the bottoms of her eyes swiftly with his thumbs and when you want to tell me the rest of it i ll be here sirius said obviously knowing she wasnttelling him the whole truth autumn didnthave the strength to lie to him so she just shrugged and turned to walk into the dorm with her thoughts to keep her company sirius walked down the stairs and joined his friends by the fireplace did she tell you what that kid told her james asked as sirius sat down yes but i not sure if she told me all of it she said that the boy told her that her father died but she seemed really shaken up about it sirius leaned against his hand well i pretty sure that alone would have shaken her up considerably remus said raising an eyebrow yes but oh it doesntmatter she ll tell me eventually sirius stared off into space with a blank expression actually mate i hate to tell you but she d probably come to me first i have after all slept with her more times than you have james grinned easily lightening up the mood sirius looked up and when he understood what james had said he grabbed the pillow from behind him and threw it at james hitting him in the face prick sirius smiled and james shrugged so quidditch game against ravenclaw tomorrow nervous james asked you kidding me lions eat birds for breakfast sirius said proudly sitting up tall i not sure lions would bother with birds that much actually remus laughed james stood up and headed towards their dorm yawning slightly i going to head to bed early as well james said then turned to sirius and flashed him a devious smile and if you dontget a good shag from fall girl soon i afraid you ll blow up from the sexual tension sirius practically flew out of his chair and attacked james to the floor and they wrestled each other for a while as peter and remus laughed at the two of them somewhere in between the punches james said something like you know it true 888888888888888 autumn sat down at breakfast the next morning and raised her eyebrow upon seeing sirius where d you get the black eye james nearly spat his food out laughing i love james school started so i really sorry about the gaps between updates i ve actually had this chapter written for a while but i wrote something at the end that i felt shouldnthappen for a little while so i cut it out shock shock autumn has a brother and was adopted overloaded with new information i know but i ve actually had this planned for a long time i was just waiting to see where i could properly fit it in poor poor autumn i should probably write a re cap soon because i doubt any of you remember the chapter where autumn gets kidnapped by slytherins i try to mention it to have the story make sense but with so many chapters it hard to recap it all i ll try also i sick which means if there are errors in this chapter i blame germs review review review you know it makes my day o snowflake prongsette o a n hello all long time no write i apologize but it very late at night and i just really wanted to get this up tomorrow i ll edit this with more information and i will send out thank you replies to everyone who reviewed for my last chapter like i usually do chapter 49 he must ve fancied you autumn was in a deep sleep when all four marauders burst into their dorm laughing her eyes snapped open and her heart started beating fast as she sat up in bed that what they get for losing a game against us autumn heard james laugh and she gave them all a rather scary death glare oh remus said as he saw autumn glaring at them i think we woke her up peter said his laugh subsiding yes but it ll cheer her up to know what we did sirius grinned at autumn sleepy face autumn only blinked in reply we ve been working on a potion for the past few weeks that ll ruin the slytherin valentines day james grinned at his own joke well that kind of a mean joke isntit autumn ruffled up her hair tiredly way to suck the fun out of it fall girl you know you think we re hilariously ingenious james said unfazed yes right sure autumn cheered up out of her sleepy mode let do something fun today like remus asked autumn shrugged animatedly with a dumb smile on her face we could climb trees and spy on people sirius suggested and james broke into a sharp laugh alright autumn changed quickly in the bathroom put a small jacket on and followed the four marauders as they led the way outside the trees outside were still bare after the harsh winter but autumn favorite tree by her favorite bench had enough branches to efficiently hide the five teenagers in its arms remus whipped out his wand and placed two stakes into the side of the tree allowing them to climb to the upper branches easily they all climbed up and took their spots in the branches sirius obviously made an effort to sit next to autumn and autumn didntcare much herself it was then that she realized the sun was only just rising what are you blokes doing waking me up so early autumn whined the earlier you rise the longer day ahead james said obviously awake himself autumn found herself dozing off however and it didnttake long for her to fall asleep comfortably in the curve of a branch by the time she woke up the sun was bright and she knew it would be a fairly nice day the marauders were still awake and laughing about something what have you guys been doing autumn asked innocently well james started you tell er padfoot alright well we were rather guiltlessly blowing up girls skirts with the wave of our wands sirius grinned shamelessly autumn sighed why am i not surprised we are wizards after all might as well take advantage of it james said remus shook his head but smiled despite himself dontbe jealous autumn you know your skirt is the only one i would ever want to sirius began but autumn smacked her hand over his mouth to cut off his sentence sirius licked her hand to get her to take her hand off and autumn laughed as she wiped her hand on the sleeve of his shirt sirius grinned and casually placed his arm around autumn shoulders autumn glared at him but let it slide aw man get a load of her peter said shyly pointing in the direction of a long legged girl through the branches hey fall girl i think you should fall asleep again for a second james flipped out his wand and autumn turned her face into sirius so that she couldntsee them at work when autumn heard the boys muffled laughs she knew they were done autumn scrunched her nose at them in disgust must you really autumn asked james simply nodded i suppose that what i get for having guy friends yes it entirely your fault we re just being ourselves james grinned at her oh i know autumn said and turned her head back into sirius side to shield her eyes just tell me when you re through wow get a look at her peter said probably gaping at some girl moony are you seriously blushing sirius said and autumn felt the rumblings of his chest as he spoke no i just warm remus said in his defense but when autumn looked up at his face she could tell that it was in fact a blush and not a cause of his being warm does moony have a little crush on said girl james grinned she only in my muggle studies class remus said she only in my muggle studies class what her name sirius mocked karen brown i knew it you fancy her james laughed and flicked remus shoulder playfully maybe a bit remus admitted his face red as a tomato well she is rather pretty sirius said calmly and they watched as the dark blond haired girl strolled past the tree autumn glared at her automatically filled with dislike for the girl she really bright as well remus sighed softly aw how adorable james pinched remus cheeks so how much progress have you made with her well she called me her friend so far remus ran his hands through his hair nervously good enough for me invite her to gryffindor and we ll get to know her and play you up a bit sirius said seriously and flashed remus an overly large grin um i ll try i doubt she ll agree though remus shrugged and settled back into his spot in the tree autumn silence irked sirius and he nudged her in the side causing her to almost fall out of the tree you still alive sirius asked i suppose so autumn answered without much emotion in her voice heyyy sirius said excitedly poking autumn cheek what wrong mmm autumn turned herself and wrapped an arm around sirius and rested her head on his chest now i cantsay i complaining sirius put one of his arms around autumn and kept her comfortably there are you two having a moment james asked the two of them yes sirius asked simply and closed his eyes relaxing well that adorable james peered out through the branches again and saw that karen was now sitting in the grass by a tree with a few of her friends cocking his head to the right james looked at remus and smiled suggestively then quickly scrambled to a lower branch and jumped out of the tree landing on all fours and bouncing back into a standing position prongs remus said worriedly and followed him out of tree in a rush ignoring the two of them sirius straightened up ah let head back to gryffindor shall we peter nodded autumn shrugged and they slowly got out of the tree and made their way back into hogwarts you know autumn said once they had entered a side entrance to hogwarts and gone inside it good for remus to finally have a little crush on someone he needs it sirius smiled while looking straight ahead we re all pretty sure he had a little something for you back in second year actually what really autumn looked up at sirius while they walked peter listened in as if it were all old news to him well before we were all friends we would make fun of moony for associating himself with you and said he must ve fancied you sirius said still smiling well that just rude you made fun of him for associating himself with me we were rude boys sirius shrugged were autumn raised her eyebrows sirius decided not to dignify her question with an answer and turned his attention to peter wormtail you think prongs is giving moony too hard a time out there nah karen nice she ll understand peter said the three of them walked in silence for a few minutes until a trio of ravenclaw girls came walking down the corridor towards them autumn fought the urge to cringe these girls had been teasing her for months about staying in the gryffindor common room with a bunch of boys usually it was just an arrogant smirk or a tsk in the halls but autumn understood exactly what they were implying this time as they passed autumn in the hall one girl gave her a low humph which autumn ignored with dignity was that sirius began were those the girls you said accused you of sleeping around he asked autumn shrugged yeah sirius turned around and shouted oy the three girls turned around shocked what have you got to say to us he said frowning furiously and walking towards them autumn and peter stood back autumn hadntseen sirius this angry in a long time nothing one of the girls said putting her hands up in defense as sirius stormed towards them he stopped and glared them down we were just wondering why you hang out with her are there any specific reasons you keep her around a brunette ravenclaw put her hands on her hips yes sirius said grabbing her jaw and directing her face upwards to meet his eyes and our reasons are very dignified thank you we keep her around because she kind sirius took a deep breath closed his eyes and released her then without a backward glance walked away from the ravenclaws and joined autumn and peter they resumed walking towards gryffindor before but with autumn grinning this time that was adorable autumn laughed adorable adorable is not quite what i was feeling sirius frowned not finding anything the slightest bit funny you completely stood up for me it was like in those films sirius that was adorable i might have the urge to hug you soon autumn said poking fun at sirius they reached the common room peter gave the password and they entered he then rolled his eyes at sirius and autumn and found a chair to shut his eyes in please refrain from hugging me just because i yelled at some girls they ve actually always bothered me i just had a reason now to tell them off yes of course autumn said sarcastically and hugged sirius in a friendly manner anyway well thank you sirius grunted in return the door to the common room entered and james emerged first with a gargantuan grin plastered across his face remus came in second and right after him was karen looking timid james came and joined sirius and autumn on a couch while remus showed karen around wow you got her to come to the common room autumn said smiling in surprise naw it really was just moony he charmed her to pieces oh autumn began changing the subject did i tell you what sirius did today um sirius shook his head and tensed his neck what did he do james said overexcited he completely stood up for me when these girls gave me a dirty look in the corridor that adorable padfoot james grinned aw come on she was pissing me off sirius slouched is shoulders in embarrassment moony is blushing sirius said desperately trying to change the subject he gestured over to where remus was sitting rather stiffly next to karen james chuckled at the two of them alright well i heading up to bed james stretched for dramatic effect and stood up yeah i think i ll come with you autumn bounced up onto her legs and the two of them walked up to the dorms speaking softly together about sirius and the incident in the hall he adores you fall girl i know he told me so autumn looked at the floor right as they reached their dorm well then i dontsee the problem james opened the door and allowed autumn to go in first following her two reasons actually one he has a history of freaking out whenever i act upon my feelings and two i kind of like it more this way sirius and i might as well be dating but it more like dating with stronger boundaries autumn sat on her bed i suppose i still think the whole situation is dumb james sat next to autumn perhaps i can whip padfoot into shape for you yes please do autumn said and there was a rather calm silence where autumn looked up at james who was smiling at his last comment autumn frowned then leaned up and kissed james putting one hand gently behind his head james placed both his hands on autumn cheeks and kissed her back for just a second but pulled back gently so as not to hurt her feelings aw autumn what was that james asked with a pitying look autumn ran her hands down her face and replied with a slightly muffled i not sure i say we forget that ever happened alright feelings and you know whose i talking about could get very hurt james sighed then said but why exactly did you i dontknow alright i just i so comfortable with you and i thought maybe autumn trailed off i going to bed now she said hinting for james to get off her bed james stood up and walked into the bathroom with a guilty heart happy first day of spring please review and i ll most likely get back to you before the next chapter is up again sorry for the uber lateness of this chapter and the lack of author note i sure you dontmind o snowflake prongsette o oh my gosh i cantbelive how stupid i was and still am sadly i didntsay thank you to my awesome reviewers midnight pixie i cantbelive i forgot to thank you last chapter you have been my most up to date reviewer thank you you rock i hope you like the little revenge in this chapter and look i guess it tastes like chicken hehe and of course i d like to thank the little peopletear but there are too many little people to list out so i won t ok i at like 8 000 words or so i so proud of myself concided tear now on to the chicken i just love saying chicken it sounds so funny on a school say at 10 30pm chicken chicken chicken foo foo dolls hahahahahaha you can just ignore that little last comment chapter 5 revenge that tastes like chicken i d been pretty cold towards lupin for a while the stupid marauders dontcare about anyone but themselves although i couldnthelp but keep replaying the thing potter said to lupin the night i started no longer liking him it almost the big night you know we risked our lives for you and before even the first night the first night with our plan you go and make friends with a slytherin nice going potter said angrily what was that suppose to mean they risked their lives for him and for some reason the plan they were talking about didntseem like their every day prank type plan no it seemed like something more serious oh well i was sure i d find out sooner or later i really needed to study for the upcoming final exams each year they seem to come faster i was pretty excited about going into 3rd year because we d finally get to go to hogsmead you know when i think of it there were only two good things about having re lupin as a friend i got potter mad i got an a on my transfiguration homework and that about it besides the fact that i didntfeel lonely 24 7 but that isntsuch a big deal right i figured i would get good marks on all of my exams except transfiguration i still wasntdoing too well in there so i figured i would make that my top studying priority but i didntworry about studying too much in fact i didntworry at all i just lazed around for the most part not really wanting to study well who does when i finally realized i should probably be studying i only had a week left i jumped up off my favorite bench can you guess which and bolted to the library in search for any book that would help me study for the transfiguration exam when i got to the isle though i found potter pettigrew and black leaning against a shelf mumbling about something probably something secret because when they saw me they all immediately stopped talking and looked up i just rolled my eyes and went to the next isle wanting to know what they were whispering about nosey nosey autumn d i kept as quiet as i could so i could hear then and caught a few sentences well remus didntreally like the fact that we ve chickened out the past few full moons i think we should give it a try this time ya but i still worried he could still hurt us even in animal form animal form i asked myself i ve read up on it werewolves dontfeel the need to hurt other animals unless they are bothering it and werewolves dont bite animals remus cantbite us i stopped breathing but what if animagus forms dontwork the same that all i needed to hear forget the transfiguration exam this was big remus is a werewolf i knew there were a few days where the marauders didnthave one of their crew but i always figured he was in the library or something but a werewolf i felt horrible i should have been a lot nicer to him he has to go through a lot and they re animagus they are going to they re going to get killed they re such idiots exams came and passed i was prepared enough i never really got a huge amount of time to study because i was always thinking about how the marauders were all animals and not in the sense their stupid girlfriends probably think either lupin is a werewolf and the rest of the marauders became illegal i imagine animagus to help him out that sweet that friends want to help friends but really i knew that by the next full moon i would see what animal their animagus forms would take but i had a fun time in the mean time guessing so far i had gotten that pettigrew would be a gerbil badger or maybe a turtle potter would be an owl maybe it was the glasses and that black would be a fox i dunno it suited him i guess i d just have to find out the last full moon of the year was going to be the monday of the last week of our second year yey it almost 3rd year i cantwait monday night finally came and i was ready in the astronomy tower with binoculars should just be just a few more min i looked down and saw a few specks crossing the yard i hastily put the binoculars to my eyes and looked down at potter pettigrew and black walking i waited for them to turn animagi i was shaking from the excitement then suddenly replacing their figures were two animals a stag and a black dog i had to look really carefully to see that pettigrew had transformed into a rat by their positioning i figured out that potter had turned into the stag and black the dog which suited them both pretty well although i think potter could have been the rat i cantget over that pettigrew is most like a rat hahahahahahahaha ok i ll calm down now pettigrew a rat hahahahahaha i was smiling a lot for the next few days i guess it was the i know something you dontknow and it a marauder secret kind of smile and then suddenly i wasntmad at any other marauders because i knew that i had something against them i even smirked at them when i passed by them in the corridors it felt so good knowing such a big secret i guess i shouldnthave been happy because lupin was a werewolf and i should be feeling really bad that i was mean to them but i know a marauder secret nothing can wreck that mood well maybe not nothing lunch on the second to last day was not exactly what you would call a mood brightener the marauders were glaring at me again even lupin that jerk i decided to just return it with a simple smile and small wave i guess you can say i gained self confidence a tiny bit since the last full moon then the marauders started whispering to each other again ug not again just then rolls of bread and chicken came flying at me but i was ready this time i swiftly took out my wand and muttered something that made the food go flying back towards them a roll smacked lupin in the face before they were able to stop them sweet revenge in the form of bread rolls and chicken i gave them an innocent smile and shrug from across the great hall and they glared in return i looked back down at my food and grinned i hadnthad this much self confidence in years and it felt good i figured i d try to stay like that the end of the year didntcome fast enough this year i was looking forward to third year so much that the hours of the last two days dragged on and on of course the marauders did their little end of the year prank and i have to admit turning all the tables red and gold swirls was much better than the letter fireworks last year spelling out marauders because by having your group name up in lights the teachers know exactly who to go to for lecturing thought they d get away from punishments at the end of the year the rascals while we were eating the end of year feast this was after the fireworks i realized with a shock that when the school year was over i was going home to my dad i know it sounds silly but for some reason my mind had it all figured out that it was so great that the end of the year was coming so i didntthink that there was going to be a summer at home and of course because i didntwant to go home the train ride home came really quickly but i decided i d make the train ride worthwhile i feel so evil right now my first cliff hanger dot dot dot isntit great i ll update within 7 days hmmm two chapters in one day not quite my style but i had them both already written chapter 50 oh and things the next morning were awkward autumn and james had been such close friends for so long that she didnteven know how to act after they has kissed the night before they both knew autumn really fancied sirius but what james couldntfigure out was why she had kissed him in the first place and why he hadntfought back at first autumn got dressed the next morning and walked out of the bathroom in silence usually james would yell a rude comment through the door and sirius would join in but this morning all was silent it didnttake sirius long to feel the tension in the air and he cleared his throat are we all very tired this morning autumn looked up from what she was doing and began to answer but then just shrugged yeah i guess so james said sirius eyed them curiously i going to head downstairs and join wormtail and moony before our first class sirius said awkwardly and left the room another silence autumn james started but autumn cut him off no i dontwant to talk about it we ll i going to force you to neither of us wanted to do it i think it was a curiosity issue autumn stopped fidgeting yes but it still happened but we didntwant it right james said confidently right but i still feel really guilty about it autumn scrunched up her nose in disgust at herself maybe we should tell sirius then it ll be out in the open and not a hidden secret james suggested i suppose but then he may think he has competition and and i dunno everything will change autumn ran a hand across her neck muscles anxiously well let talk about what to do later james said smiling but first james walked over to autumn and enveloped her into a big hug i not going to deny what happened because i dontus to lie to ourselves it was just a kiss i know and since neither of us really meant it it doesntmean anything i guess autumn smiled gratefully go to your first class and we ll talk during lunch james said grabbing his book bag and leaving the room autumn hurried to follow him 888888888888888 lunch came much too quickly but in those short few hours that autumn had been in class thinking to herself she had come to a solid conclusion she would talk to sirius and tell him everything everything autumn walked quickly to the great hall hoping the marauders were already sitting at the gryffindor table they weren t autumn sat in their usual spot at the long table and drummed her fingernails quickly on the table obviously nervous when the marauders came into the great hall together autumn had to suppress the urge to stand up impatiently she remained seated and took her first bite of food hey autumn hey fall girl james winked and sirius mussed her hair in one quick motion sirius could i talk to you autumn finally said oh uh yeah yeah of course sirius stood and out of the corner of her eye autumn saw james nod in approval once autumn had pulled sirius off to the side she began her spiel hello autumn said hi do you happen to remember that one time when that boy named vincent jackson pulled me aside and talked to me yeah his parents work with james or something he told you that your father had died right he didntdo anything sirius looked worried no nothing like that see he didntjust inform me of my father passing he also told me that he was my brother by blood and that his family er my family had given me up to a muggle family when they suspected me of being a squib they were one of those pureblood families you know but anyway so i guess that means that legally my name is autumn jackson and that i really not a muggle born at all which would explain the me getting sorted into slytherin thing and all the slytherin trying to recruit me into their little club vincent is one of the little slytherin cult leaders i guess y sirius began his eyes wide in shock oh and i kissed james last night sirius looked at the floor as if he were calculating something is this an elaborate prank absolutely not sirius looked up to see autumn eyes shining with threatening tears let s go talk somewhere else sirius mumbled stiffly they walked out of the great hall and straight outside to the bench by the tall tree autumn knew so well sirius had forgotten to glare at james on their way out they sat on the bench your brother vincent jackson the slytherin sirius stated to himself deep in thought now that i think about it he looks almost exactly like you except more masculine yeah i noticed that too autumn said quietly so i guess you re not the first muggle born in slytherin house i kind of feel like a piece of my personality was chipped off actually autumn sighed sirius stood up looking determined i going to skip the rest of my classes would you like to join me he didntsmile like he usually would when saying something like that sure they walked together back inside the hogwarts castle in time to catch the last of the students leaving lunch at the great hall sirius and autumn strolled side by side in the corridor the air still felt a bit tense but autumn felt a little better herself they walked in silence until sirius wide eyed stopped dead in his tracks and turned to autumn you kissed james he said as if he had just heard it for the first time oh i suppose we were going to talk about that huh autumn looked at the floor but i thought you didn t do you you know like him like that because it wontbe the first time that someone has thought that you ve fancied james sirius tried not to act jealous but it flickered very obviously in his expression no absolutely not and he and i talked about it this morning and it was me not him for the record we decided it came out of loneliness and curiosity autumn shrugged ashamed curiosity we didntmean it and it meant nothing can we just leave it at that autumn frowned slightly irritated you cantjust whatever sirius said his fists curling up and his shoulders tensing slightly they continued walking you re angry autumn stated pointing out the obvious of course i am sirius said with gritted teeth well i dontreally think you have any right to be it not like we re together i have the right to kiss anyone i want honestly if i want to kiss james that not your business autumn said angrily and frowned fine kiss james all you want you re right it not my business date him kiss him shag him i dontcare what you do sirius replied irritably in a low voice i didntmean it like that sirius i already said i didntlike him that way right stop getting so riled up about it it was a simple mistake and it not going to happen again let not you and i get in a fight again you know how terrible it is when we fight plus o w l s are in a few weeks and i dontthink we can afford to have our minds elsewhere autumn said defending herself again why are you making it sound like i the one that did something wrong how is kissing james wrong autumn said raising her voice a bit stop denying it we have something you and i have been on and off since we were eleven bloody years old they reached the gryffindor common room and they glared at each other for a quick moment and then sirius muttered the password and they entered the first thing they saw was james sitting down looking frightened for his life at the sight of sirius glare hey mate james said nervously sirius didntanswer him and walked off to their dorm after he was gone autumn sat down on the couch next to james they were the only ones around the dead fireplace i didnthandle it well autumn sighed that alright he ll understand eventually i sure james messed with his hair so are you and i completely awkward now autumn smiled anticipating his answer aw of course not james held out his arms to signal her to come closer he engulfed autumn in his arms and squeezed her we re the bestest friends ever autumn giggled 888888888888888 sirius tried to act like nothing was wrong between him james and autumn but things were obviously a bit tense whenever james and autumn were close sirius went silent this lasted clear through o w l s and autumn was starting to feel sick in the stomach because of it but one saturday evening sirius mood changed drastically as he came running up to autumn in the hall autumn autumn guess what i just did your homework autumn said mockingly hilarious no i told snivellus how to get into the shrieking shack tonight oh is that really the smartest thing to be do wait sirius is tonight a full moon why yes it is sirius said proudly give him a little scare are you insane remus cantcontrol himself when he a werewolf he going to rip snape to shreds he wontreally sirius began but autumn wasntlistening anymore she bolted through the corridor towards the common room she quickly said the password and ran inside she saw peter walking towards her peter where james he just left the common room autumn didntanswer she just ran back out and went towards the main doors she turned a corner and ran smack into someone making her fall backwards onto the floor she held her head in pain looking up to see james hey fall girl i was about heading back to the common room because i forgot my wand what are you in such a rush for james said happily and helped autumn back onto her feet oh um autumn began trying to think past the pain in her head from the collision right sirius told snape to prod the knot on the tree and go into the shrieking shack and he so stupid james stared blankly at autumn please tell me you re joking no unfortunately sirius really is that dumb autumn said angrily james cursed and ran off towards the whomping willow autumn still in a state of panic but not knowing what else she could possibly do she walked back to the common room alone by the time she got there peter was gone and there were a lot of gryffindors hanging around the common room autumn felt suddenly very left out and alone she walked up to their dorm and sat down on her bed autumn couldntconcentrate she fiddled with her nails paced the room and even tried to get a start on some of her homework eventually she drove herself mad waiting so she just sat back down with her head in her hands and after a while she fell asleep fully dressed on her bed in the morning autumn heard a loud bang that woke her up suddenly she quickly sat up and noticed the loud bang was james slamming the door open into the wall james are you alright autumn asked but james ignored her and turned around facing sirius what the hell is your problem did you fall and hit your head or did you just take a potion to make you lose all sense james yelled at the top of his lungs remus walked past james and sat quietly next to autumn stop scolding me i know what i did sirius said frowning can you possibly understand how dangerous that was i said i know what i did sirius crossed his arms across his chest just get out of my face james stomped into the bathroom and slammed the door behind him it was very silent for a minute sirius looked at autumn and she avoided his eyes were you guys out all night autumn asked remus noticing his sleepy eyes yes remus said looking down at the floor you know none of this is your fault right remus sure remus said unconvincingly autumn put a hand on remus shoulder comfortingly sirius left the room and autumn was quick to follow him out she closed the door behind her sirius autumn i not even going to ask what you were thinking but where were you boys all last night trying to convince snape not to say anything for a few hours then dumbledore called us into his office for the rest of the night oh sirius what were you thinking autumn finally asked sirius sighed and ran a hand through his hair i didntactually think he would do it well i guess i did i dunno i wasnt thinking i guess well at least you re man enough to admit it autumn smiled sirius leaned down and kissed her on the nose and laughed i feel bad about moony though i think he feels pretty guilty sirius said solemnly yes but we all know it was your fault so dontworry autumn teased then placed a hand on sirius shoulder it not james i fancy girly man aw i already know you love me sirius said with a grin and nudged her cheek with his nose you need to apologize to james and remus without attitude or sarcasm alright sure so sirius i was thinking autumn looked at the floor james opened the door behind her oh you re here james rolled his eyes and moved to close the door again wait prongs can i talk to you for a second sirius said acting as modest as he could autumn gave him an encouraging smile and james shrugged walking down the stairs into the common room sirius directly behind him autumn skipped back into the dorm and found that she could sleep quite easily now even with a lot on her mind she felt satisfied aw o snowflake prongsette o i haventposted for 78 days and i ve had this chapter done for months oh no well sorry about that this chapter is dedicated to bad fairy for being so loyal to my chapters even when it takes me months to update chapter 51 viking school was finally out for summer and sirius autumn and james were sitting on the edge of james pool with their feet in the water you know autumn began just a few years ago around this time you punched me in the nose you know that was my first bloody nose autumn smiled you love bringing that event up dontyou james smiled back acting slightly annoyed i didntget to see that i ve missed years of jokes sirius crossed his arms are you going to cry autumn mocked sirius just frowned at her in response james sloshed the water around with his leg and rolled up one of his pant legs further i suppose it was pretty epic it was the first and last time i ever hit a girl james said with a tad of guilt shrugging well now that not completely true autumn held a straight face james thought for a second then answered no i pretty sure i had never hit a girl before that or after that you hit sirius autumn cracked a grin and james laughed hey sirius sat up straight and promptly shoved autumn into the pool predictably soon all three of them were in the pool james jumped back out of the pool i going to change into a bathing suit do you guys want to change as well james asked no i ll just let the sun dry me sirius said overenthusiastically and autumn nodded in agreement james walked awkwardly and uncomfortably back into his house sirius and autumn sat back out of the pool autumn smiled knowingly up at sirius and grabbed his hand threading her fingers with his and leaning her head on his shoulder well isnt this fantastic and unexpected sirius said eyeing their clasped hands autumn ignored the comment but smiled anyway after a few minutes james walked back out in his swimsuit and slowly walked towards sirius and autumn get a room james scrunched up his nose really prongs would you like us to get a room would you really like to know what autumn i and i do when we are alone together in a room sirius raised his eyebrows at james james stared wide eyed at sirius i hate you black autumn said to sirius you two did you did you two you know james stuttered no autumn said blushing while james said at the same time maybe honestly sirius i am going to stab you in the chest shut up autumn frowned alright fine no prongs we did absolutely nothing of the matter although i absolutely wouldntmind if i had autumn all alone in a room and sirius began but autumn slapped her hand against his mouth do you really need another death threat autumn threatened mate i would close your mouth if i were you james chuckled sirius shrugged i think i ll go change now autumn stood up and began walking towards the house i ll come along sirius said with an over exaggerated wink toward james both james and autumn rolled their eyes autumn proceeded up the stairs with sirius close behind when they reached the door to autumn room sirius leaned seductively against her door your room or my room baby sirius raised an eyebrow obviously trying to raise his sex appeal you re in quite a good mood today arentyou cracking suggestive jokes left and right you realize we arenteven dating right autumn said in all seriousness well yes sirius took on a more serious attitude and crossed his arms we can change that though i mean the only reason we arenttogether is because you don t trust me right i suppose it seems like once you got the satisfaction of being with me you would quickly move on to other girls i ve been going after you for years how does that not show devotion sirius said aggravated yes but while being devoted to me you have gone with other girls along the way well you cantexpect me to wait around forever sirius sniffed exactly fine but we cantkeep going on like this sirius calmed down what do you mean like what the flirting and retreating thing it getting a bit tiring sirius said honestly autumn crossed her arms and said does it really bother you that much sirius shrugged and then cracked a smile and poked her nose with his finger we ll discuss it later go change now sirius grinned and allowed her to enter her room sirius sprinted back into his room and changed into a swim suit as quickly as he could then slowly walked back to autumn room opened the door suddenly and ran in hello he said cheerfully and loudly autumn screamed in surprise and modesty and covered herself with a pillow that she grabbed off her bed sirius began to laugh and autumn just frowned at him arentwe a little too old to barge into each other rooms while they are changing autumn scolded no we are never too old also if you would just agree to date me we could make this a regular practice and then you wouldnthave to cover yourself with a pillow sirius smiled mischievously and poked the pillow that autumn held to her chest autumn continued frowning aw come on you know i funny sirius gave her a puppy face get out autumn said sternly but sirius knew deep inside she adored his attention alright but if i leave i ll tell jamsie we shagged in your bed sirius attempted a straight face he wouldntbelieve you autumn finally smiled slightly wouldnthe sirius rolled up on his toes and rolled back down autumn stared at him for a moment as if testing him and then answered no he would not believe you alrighty sirius sighed then i ll just have to go tell him goodbye he stepped out of her room and casually walked downstairs autumn rolled her eyes and stood in her room for a minute then realized james may actually believe sirius and that she should probably be down there to defend herself she quickly threw on a swim suit top and ran downstairs autumn was greeted outside by james wide eyes it not true i promise autumn insisted he saw your you flashed padfoot james asked worriedly oh um well he ran into my room while i was changing and i not actually sure what all he saw autumn said nervously sirius tilted his head toward james and smiled oh i saw did you really autumn suddenly felt very self conscious yeah sorry about that but you do have very slow pillow covering reflexes sirius smiled sheepishly way to go mate james held up his hand and sirius high fived it james noticed autumn looking extremely embarrassed and tried to reassure her it has been five years since we met you and four since sirius decided he fancied you so it about time he saw your james motioned towards autumn breasts you know yes but wait did you say four years autumn said shocked james thought for a moment then replied yeah four years right mate by this point sirius was beet red are we done embarrassing sirius sirius said awkwardly i not nearly done punishing you for being a peeping tom what i should do is walk in on you changing and then make fun of your size after seeing you naked autumn smiled there are two problems with that punishment one you wouldnthave to walk in on me to see me in my glory i will gladly show you my privates at any time and two when and note the word when you see my viking you will not be making fun of his size sirius grinned your viking autumn raised her eyebrows is that what you re calling it well no but i couldntthink of a better sirius tried to make up for his words good seducing technique mate call it your viking i applaud you james said sarcastically oh shove it sirius said angrily conversation over who wants a sandwich james smiled innocently and walked happily inside and into the kitchen while autumn and sirius sat outside waiting for james to finish making their sandwiches autumn tilted her head towards sirius did you really see anything when you walked in she whispered embarrassed no you covered yourself with that pillow too quickly sirius grinned nice reflexes by the way sirius added purely for mocking purposes autumn raised her eyebrows and pushed sirius clear off his seat james walked out with his plate of sandwiches just in time to see sirius go flying off his seat i see we re all getting along james smiled 888888888888888 a few days later bright and early in the morning autumn sat on her bed still under the bed sheets as she had just woken up she stared off in a daze obviously not accepting morning as a reality of course this daze didntlast long as autumn was still in james home and in james mansion no one was ever in a daze for long this particular morning sirius opened the door suddenly guten morgen sirius bellowed obviously very awake since when did you know german autumn felt her hair to make sure it wasnttoo much of a mess it was oh is that german remus just said it one day and told me it meant good morning soooooo my birthday is coming up sirius jumped up onto autumn bed and began to jump up and down no it not it in september it only the beginning of july autumn frowned sirius ignored this and continued so i would like this sirius pulled out a rolled up catalog from his back pocket and then sat down in front of autumn he unrolled the catalog in front of her and pointed to the middle of the page a muggle motorcycle yes can you ride a motocycle no sirius continued smiling and added but i will learn and i know muggle motorcycles are very expensive but you should buy it for me anyway does james know about this impulse of yours better yet have you told remus no and no they would both bite my head off but you re a terribly sensible girl and of course you will buy it for me right absolutely not get out of my room autumn was apparently too tired to deal with sirius your hair is adorable like that all bunched up on top of your head much like broccoli actually why thank you so much autumn answered sarcastically sirius replied by falling over on top of her and smothering her in a giant hug this cheered autumn up a bit she giggled and attempted to push him off her you re my favorite slytherin aw well shucks autumn said not able to fully push sirius off her am i your favorite gryffindor sirius asked excitedly if i say yes will you get off sure then yes you re my favorite gryffindor autumn said and sirius sat up and stood up on the floor by autumn bed i telling james you said i was your favorite sirius said childishly and bolted out of the room autumn rolled her eyes unless you ve never read harry potter books i sure you know that sirius gets his wish somehow i had fun with this chapter these last few chapters have mostly been a build up it almost over i promise o snowflake prongsette o i updated whaaaat this next chapter goes out to cassie93 and ladyalmondstar for making my day chapter 52 t erribly embarrassing i hate august sirius threw his arms into the air why that autumn asked without any real curiosity james didntlift his head to hear the answer at all because in august all you can think about is how we have to go back to school sirius said frowning i for one never hate going back to hogwarts james began finally lifting his head from the quidditch magazine he was reading it become a home for me well yes but the homework and the exams and the professors oh my autumn said quickly cracking a wizard of oz joke that neither james nor sirius obviously understood how many days do we have until classes begin autumn asked sirius about fifteen sirius shrugged it not all bad mate quidditch season starts up again i s pose i definitely looking forward to the mass of girls that think i shacking up with the marauders autumn said sarcastically i dontmind that bit too much it ups my reputation as a badboy sirius said grinning but seriously fall girl if those girls keep bothering you about staying with us then just mention it and we ll take care of them james made a fist with his right hand emphasizing his point i thought you said you didnthit girls autumn raised an eyebrow they re not girls james smiled they re beasts hmm maybe i should have friends of my own gender autumn thought for a moment that would be terribly boring you would have to actually care about petty things like making your hair look nice and makeup and which boy is prettier and such sirius scrunched up his nose what exactly are you saying about my hair autumn smiled 888888888888888 quidditch season did indeed begin again along with classes and sirius waking autumn up every morning at 5am simply because he had to be awake for quidditch practice shove it girly man autumn shouted as loud as she could at so ungodly an hour good morning beautiful sirius stopped jumping on autumn bed and jumped to the floor why do i always have to be awake when you two do this is why i didntjoin quidditch i love my precious sleep no you didntjoin quidditch because you re terrible on a broomstick james corrected her from the other side of the room remus muttered something incoherent and threw a sock at sirius obviously trying to get them to quiet down james waited for sirius to finish dressing and autumn decided to get up and get ready for the day now that she was up she finished getting ready just as sirius was ready and so she walked them out of the common room look autumn whined as they passed a window in the corridor it still dark out only just the sun is about to come up james said shrugging the three of them walked out onto the pitch and as james promised the sun peeked out from over the horizon autumn broke away from the two boys and went to sit in the stands she pulled her hat down tighter and sleepily watched the gryffindor quidditch team practice about an hour and a half later practice ended and autumn awoke to the sound of a whistle blowing the quidditch team walked off the pitch laughing and patting each other on the back autumn jumped down the stands and quickly followed behind the team she hardly noticed one of the boys on the team following her with his eyes as she caught up with james and sirius how was practice she asked well you were watching james said quizzically but i dozed off anything interesting happen nah not really but we were all pretty worked up today it probably the crisp air or something the boy that had been eyeing autumn walked over to the three and started walking backwards so as to face them hey mates yeah owen sirius frowned in concern is anything wrong no i just d you think i could have a word with um autumn alone owen said quickly and james sirius and autumn all stopped walking sirius and james were both silent for a few seconds obviously confused sure mate we ll see you in the locker room sirius said side glancing james and nodding to autumn before walking away autumn looked apprehensive what was it you needed owen autumn asked him she had seen him at games before and knew he was a pretty good guy from what little james and sirius had said about him she knew he was a 7th year meaning he was a year ahead of them well there a trip to hogsmeade this weekend he began and autumn already knew what was coming and i was wondering if maybe you d want to go with me i mean i know you re really close to black and potter but i didntthink they d mind he waited for autumn reply oh that really really nice of you owen she quickly racked her mind for a list of excuses but only came up with but i sort of already have a boyfriend she blushed at her lie no kidding owen asked and autumn shook her head slightly oh well it was worth a try who is he anyway he asked autumn stuttered for a second trying to think if she should make up a name or use someone she knew sirius she answered as a question really i thought you two were just friends well donti feel like a prick see you around though he looked at the floor his ego slightly damaged yeah no worries autumn said with a shaky voice once he left autumn stood for a moment trying to find the courage to walk around to where she usually met sirius and james after practice she finally took a step and then walked to the spot inside hogwarts by the great hall that she was going to meet them she leaned against the wall and tried to recollect her thoughts while she was thinking sirius and james showed up what did owen want from you sirius asked obviously having no idea from his emotionless expression autumn immediately turned bright red and she shrugged he asked you out didnthe james smiled yeah she replied and the two boys looked at each other quickly what did you say sirius asked trying to act calm about the situation um i lied and said i was already seeing someone the boys broke out in laughter it not funny it was terribly embarrassing for both of us autumn frowned but her blush remained when the two of them finished their rude laughter sirius smiled and asked did you tell him who you were dating exactly maybe autumn replied afraid of her answer oh ho now you ve got me interested who did you say it was james grinned autumn shrugged again and then motioned toward sirius and mumbled something what sirius said with a smile still left over from his laughter well i didntwant to make someone up so i said it was you autumn blush deepened and she looked rather ashamed james didntstop grinning but sirius smile dropped a bit i really sorry i just didntknow what else to say when he asked who it was and i didntthink you would mind too much from the amount of time you spend over the summer trying to get me to agree to dating you and well of course i dontmind but you realize it may turn into a rumor sirius said seriously now we can always dispel it we can just deny it whenever anyone asks autumn tried yes of course that ll work james rolled his eyes go away sirius said to james and james just smiled knowingly and walked into the great hall i sorry autumn repeated no dontbe sorry you know this could be a good time for us to actually date sirius wiggled his eyebrows dontjoke around autumn frowned you know actually i not joking sirius put on a stern face can i just have some time to think about it i dontreally like the idea at all autumn sighed you ve had at least two years to think about it you re killing me here it not practical sirius if we date things will fall apart and then our lives will be extremely awkward you boys are the only friends i have if i lose you then what will i have autumn looked down at her feet autumn we re never going to abandon you unless we die or something which isntpossible because the marauders are invincible sirius said his smile returning autumn smiled weakly fine i ll give you as much time as you want to think about it i ll even stay single it ll kill me but i ll try sirius gave in with a joking tone in the last bit casanova is going to stay single i dontbelieve you what if i dontmake up my mind for seven years well then casanova is going to have to go without a shag for seven years sirius sighed jokingly and autumn rolled her eyes yes keep pretending you re not an innocent little boy it makes you look silly autumn smiled and sirius puffed up his shoulders and gave her a suggestive look you know you want me sirius said in an over exaggerated deep voice with a few eyebrow wiggles autumn pushed him on the shoulder and then she walked into the great hall with him quick on her heels 888888888888888 james autumn tugged on james hand wow i have never heard you say my name in such a formal tone james raised his eyebrows expecting bad news no i just i need your help autumn said a little nervously yeah anything well sirius birthday is in fourteen days and oh i know it stupid of me to ask but i ve been saving up all summer for his present but i ve come up pretty short so i thought maybe as his best friend you could help autumn smiled modestly james began to answer but then realized what she was asking and answered please please donttell me you re getting him the motorcycle he going to go wild and kill himself james exclaimed i know but i really want to get it for him because he been so good to me and i feel like i owe it to him plus you ve never really gotten him anything big for his birthday and you are his very closest friend do not guilt me into this james grinned please please please pleaaaase autumn pouted her lower lip fine but only on one condition sure autumn said eagerly never tell him i had any part in this i want him to think this was all your idea and all your money because if he gets terribly hurt i want him to blame you is that clear james sighed peeved by how easily he gave into whatever autumn said autumn jumped with glee hugged him and kissed him on the cheek oh thank you so much shouldntyou be kissing your boyfriend a girl passing by said to autumn my boyfriend oh you mean sirius no he and i arenttogether autumn said as coolly as she could manage right the girl said eyeing james with a judging look and then walked away i hate girls autumn frowned well that makes one of us james grinned at lily as she passed by and he immediately ruffled his hair autumn grabbed his hand and pulled it down stop messing with your hair she grumbled james just nodded absentmindedly and followed lily with his eyes down the corridor autumn rolled her eyes why dontyou make a real attempt to ask her on a date i haventasked her out since last year james ruffled the back of his hair at the thought so make a good impression this time i gave you lessons on not being a prick remember autumn laughed yes dontmention quidditch how hot she is or anything about yourself i believe in you um alright i guess james said and went in the direction that lily went in walking in a sort of daze autumn shook her head grinning sympathetically and continued walking toward the gryffindor common room when she walked into the common room autumn was greeted by a certain sirius black who hugged her around the middle and picked her up carrying her over to a couch and dropping her onto it hello to you too autumn smiled and sat up my birthday is in thirteen days and five hours sirius grinned is it i almost forgot between when you last told me an hour ago and now although i suppose last time you said six hours autumn said sirius didntseem insulted at all james said he got firewhiskey sirius looked a bit too overexcited oh dear how is it that i updated in september it this funny thing called postponing my homework so it my senior year of high school which means not only is this story almost four years old holy bologna but i will also be pretty darned busy with applying to college and graduating and such can you guess what the next chapter is going to be about birthday maybe i ve been planning this next chapter for three years roughly sooooo i ll probably be updating pretty soon simply because i really want to get to writing the next chapter i think you guys will feel as giddy reading it as i will writing it well i can always hope o snowflake prongsette o how many times is it possible to apologize for how long this chapter has taken i started getting emails about whether i quit the story no i ll explain in the authors note at the bottom as

are you still reading my fanfic you ve been around for so long and i apologize a million times that i haventthanked you in almost a year i hope this chapter is as great to read as it was to write i crazy excited about this one here we go chapter 53 i ll love them both it was three in the morning on sirius birthday and autumn was awake already she was not only awake but also outside in the dark with sirius birthday present she put an invisibility charm on it and with a smile she briskly jogged back inside and up into the boys dorm she nudged james peter and remus into waking up so they could participate in surprising sirius for his 17th birthday as well james could tell that autumn was beyond excited for some reason she seemed overly enthusiastic about the entire event creeping downstairs the four of them whispered their plans for sirius birthday and james was sure to bring up the topic of firewhiskey enough times to earn a loving shut up slap in the head from autumn did you put his present outside james asked autumn it under an invisibility charm just beside that big tree we used to climb all the time autumn said overjoyed i know it sirius birthday but why on earth are you so excited remus asked scratching at his ear it probably because he been so excited about his own birthday that it rubbed off on me autumn replied with a wink i can see that you even winked like padfoot james shuddered at the resemblance and autumn rolled her eyes they moved to the couches by the empty fireplace and continued their plans alright so james obviously has the firewhiskey covered the rules surrounding the alcohol are that no one drinks more than i say they can and if we get caught i had nothing to do with it clear autumn half joked wouldntwant to ruin that perfect little record of yours james teased and pulled at autumn ear autumn slapped james hand off nonchalantly and continued i d like to save my present for last if that alright i think once he gets it he ll be too busy to come back to any festivities autumn thought for a moment we re sure sirius doesntwant a big party positive he mentioned it a billion and half times remus answered well alright then let quickly set things up and then we can go wake him up autumn said and jumped to her feet excitedly the four of them ran off and hurried to finish setting things up which didntinclude very much and returned to the gryffindor common room they sneaked up to the boys dorm and crept beside sirius bed at james mark the four of them shouted happy birthday as autumn hopped onto sirius bed and began bouncing around sirius sat up slowly and opened his eyes sluggishly aw you guys are great but did you buy me cake he smiled with as much mischief as he could muster in his tired state isntit a bit early for ca no sirius cut remus off quickly we canttell you what we got for you stupid padfoot james grinned then added get out of bed now sirius hid his excitement and pretended to have a hard time getting out of bed and standing up follow us james said and he remus and peter marched out of the room autumn stayed back for a second and whispered into sirius ear i have a couple surprises for you at the end of the night that i think you ll like sirius eyebrows shot in the air and autumn pushed him forward 888888888888888 they decided to hold sirius private party in an unused classroom on the 5th floor autumn returned from the bathroom to find the four boys laughing a bit more than they should boys i was gone less than fifteen minutes you didnthappen to drink more than i would allow did you the only response she got was a mass of giggles and then finally sirius stood up clumsily and walked over to autumn your pretty girly knickers are in a twist sirius began to giggle some more autmn reached into her robe and pulled out two small vials she walked past sirius and opened the vial forcing both peter and james to drink one of the vials remus hadntdrunk much at all of course james frowned did that potion just sober us up he looked around the room to confirm that he was in fact a bit less drunk only just a little bit you ll still feel quite a bit tipsy that potion took me a week to make and i so glad i did although i think i ll allow sirius to stay in his embarrassing state as it is his birthday and he is allowed to do whatever he wants autumn smiled as james crossed his arms angrily sirius overheard and came over stumbling i can do anything can i take alllll your clothes off i ve always wanted to sirius grinned no you may not autumn laughed at the faces sirius made when completely inebriated i made you laugh i always make you laugh laughing is fun i think you love me because you laughed sirius seemed confused ah i know a birthday present sirius will truly appreciate james stood up and walked over to an unopened firewhiskey bottle standing on a table across the room let get autumn rip roaring drunk but i want to be not drunk when that happens sirius said slowly and sat on the floor well i ll be glad to offer you this autumn pulled out a third vial unscrewed the lid and helped sirius drink the contents sirius smiled quickly back to his goofy sober self best birthday present ever sirius ran over to james and stole the bottle of firewhiskey from him and then ran back to where autumn was sitting on the floor leaning against a wall sirius leaned in to hand autumn the bottle when she quickly said i ll give you my presents earlier if you dontmake me get drunk aw autumn you re really no fun sirius said but placed the bottle on the floor in defeat your presents better be the best presents of my life sirius frowned and autumn winked at james 888888888888888 the night went on and autumn finally loosened up sirius cunningly convinced her to take a few drinks out of the bottle remembering she had an extremely low tolerance for alcohol she was making a complete fool of herself sirius seemed to thoroughly enjoy the fact that autumn kept relying on him to stand up he was also enjoying very much how ridiculous she sounded sirius autumn jumped yes giiiirly man um sirius yes your hair is perfect thank you i like it i so glad sirius said and rolled his eyes at this point the smile from autumn lips faded mate i think the fun is disappearing and the sick is kickin in james said nervously and helped sirius grab autumn and lay her down on the floor aw why do people do this autumn groaned poor baby sirius said with sympathetic eyes and pulled autumn into himself hugging her and letting her lean between his legs against his chest i suppose you should give her the vial aye remus reminded sirius sirius pulled the vial out from the inside of autumn robe and sighed must i really i quite enjoying this at least you re being honest mate james laughed he thinks i the best autumn smiled through closed eyes you know he does james confirmed alright open wide sirius held the vial up to autumn lips and she allowed the liquid to drain into her mouth after a minute sirius asked feeling better mmhmmm sooo where are my presents he asked but i so comfortable autumn sighed sirius stood up suddenly and pulled autumn up along with him presents sirius demanded okay alright fine autumn walked toward the door and turned back to say boys you can head back up to the common room this might take a little while i really hope this is what i think it is sirius winked suggestively at autumn and she giggled rather than rolling her eyes as sirius expected sirius followed autumn as she led him outside into the dark as they walked autumn began nervously rambling i really dontknow which present to give you first i afraid if i give you one before the other you wontappreciate it as much but the other way around would just be awkward autumn sirius said softly yes i ll love them both i promise he smiled lightly oh my i hope so autumn began fiddling with her fingers as she started to slow her pace why are you so nervous sirius raised an eyebrow autumn decided not to answer his question but instead said we re here we re where exactly sirius stopped walking and looked around at the familiar bench tree and stone laid path well i going to give you the better of the two presents first i think and it under an invisibility charm there autumn pointed to a spot in front of them should i reveal it or do you want to sirius asked still very curious as to why autumn was so terribly nervous oh i ll do it autumn bit her finger as she flicked her wand quickly and the invisibility charm came off the motorcycle sirius was speechless um i saved up for a while and you said you wanted it so i um it muggle but it flies autumn fidgeted and looked at her feet while she waited for sirius to respond did you change your mind about wanting it her heart dropped but then she looked up to figure out the expression on sirius face and she knew he hadntchanged his mind once he was able to take his eyes off the motorcycle he turned to autumn and grinned wildly autumn he said with a tone of disbelief he then engulfed her in a tight hug and picked her up swinging her legs around playfully autumn laughed in relief you like it she said as sirius placed her back on the floor sirius responded with a maniacal laugh he ran over to it and began to run his hands along his present he hastily climbed on and turned the engine on want to go for a ride with me sirius winked no merlin no go by yourself she then quickly explained how to drive and fly the motorcycle sirius began to drive the motorcycle like a professional which wasnttoo difficult as the bike was magically set to always stay balanced and then soon pressed a button and shot into the air autumn sat down leaning against one of the school walls and watched sirius with amusement he flew over the lake and sometimes flew out of autumn sight occasionally she could hear his laugh echo back to her after half an hour sirius landed back next to autumn and pushed his wind blown hair back how was it autumn grinned and stood up you re coming with me sirius jumped off his bike ran over to autumn and grabbed her around the waist pulling her toward the bike no you ll kill me but it ll be the most fun anyone will ever have dying sirius was obviously filled with more joy than he could handle he placed autumn on the bike and she gave in allowing him to swing her leg over the other side he hugged her tightly first then climbed on in front sirius flew them around for over two hours until it was almost 5am and the sun was just about ready to rise they then touched down and climbed off the bike both completely out of breath from laughing and yelling thank you thank you thank you thank you sirius faced autumn and ran his fingers through her hair once to get the tangles out from being blown by the wind for so long autumn blushed like crazy when she felt his fingers run through her hair sirius couldntsee the color change in her skin as the sky was still almost entirely dark they both grinned at each other for a few seconds and autumn mind went blank sirius cleared his throat breaking the silence and asked uh so you said something about a second present autumn snapped out of her daze right er sirius walked toward autumn in a jokingly seductive matter he backed her up against the wall they were standing near and put his hands above her on either side of her head by this point autumn was beet red and uncomfortably warm sirius puckered his lips over dramatically can i get a kiss for my birthday sirius tapped his lips with his finger and chuckled waiting for autumn sarcastic answer or a light slap to the face instead autumn leaned up a bit and quickly kissed him sirius immediately took his hands off the wall and stepped back i was joking he said the smile wiped off his face and shock replacing it you didnthave to i thought you d autumn cut him off no i wanted to autumn looked completely disheartened at sirius reaction i so sorry i thought maybe your offer from a few weeks ago was serious and still stood and i thought about it and i just her voice broke and tears welled up in her eyes no sweetie i loved it i just wanted to make sure you didntdo it just because i asked you to he cupped her chin with is hand what were you saying about my offer a few weeks ago you mean the one where i said we might as well be together autumn nodded i was being completely honest i want it more than anything do you want me to forget you ever kissed me sirius asked with a frown and autumn shrugged we can talk about this later let get your mind off of it what was your second birthday present for me sirius put on a smile that was it autumn put her hands over her face autumn say exactly what you mean what exactly was your present autumn slid her hands off her face and replied to accept your offer from a few weeks ago i want to be with you you know that you ve known that for years sirius was now grinning his face off what re you grinning at autumn cracked a smile you you ve been and will always be the most beautiful girl i ve ever seen sirius chuckled and messed with is hair nervously do you promise you want to be with me because you ve thought about it and not because it my birthday autumn gestured to the sun that was just about to come up and smiled it not your birthday anymore dummy sirius bent over laughing as if he were having trouble breathing he stood up after a few seconds with a huge grin still across his face autumn replied with a grin of her own without another wasted second sirius swiftly stepped forward and kissed autumn with all his might holding her face desperately with both hands want a reason for why i ve been gone for a year or so it because i got a boyfriend and i knew it i knew once i got a serious boyfriend i wouldntwrite as much as i did

chapter muahahaha anyway i desperately hope you enjoy this chapter it been brewing in my mind for a while i promise the next will be longer things will be getting steamy chapter 54 ready sirius and autumn crept back into the boys dorm holding hands just as the sun fully came up into the sky 888888888888888 james ambled into the gryffindor common room with a relaxed look on his face remus looked up from his homework and smiled hey prongs what re you looking so content for james joined remus on the couch and put his feet up on the table remus was doing his homework on ah classes are over for the day and what could make a man happier than having no homework james grinned with half closed eyes lucky bugger remus laughed and picked his quill back up james looked around cooly where is everyone james asked who do you mean remus looked up again peter is usually sitting in a chair watching you do your homework lily is usually sitting with her friends in a corner being beautiful and sirius and autumn are finally together so they should be making googly eyes at each other somewhere where i can tease them james grinned at his clever remark peter is off taking a remedial class and lily is most likely in the library or still in class remus nervously pretended to go back to his homework you forgot the lovebirds where are they on this wonderful afternoon i rather miss their nauseating affection james chuckled oh i not sure remus avoided james eyes james paused for a moment then said you re hiding something no i i just remus became visibly uncomfortable where are they they re in our dorm remus admitted james stiffened and his eyes widened in anger how long about half an hour remus muttered timidly james cursed and ran straight for the boys dorm behind him remus guiltily watched james twisted the doorknob hurriedly but it didntbudge his anger soared he stood back and shot every unlocking spell he knew at the door he tried the door again and this time it swung open prongs sirius quickly sat up and moved away from autumn who was lying in his bed both teenagers were down to their undergarments and autumn sat up in embarrassment james cursed and grabbed sirius by the arm pulling him off his bed and away from autumn black what the hell are you thinking you canttake advantage of her you ve only been going together for a week prongs mate calm down i not taking advantage of her sirius voice shook but he tried to remain calm he really isn t autumn reassured james regardless it too early for this what if i had left the two of you alone in here for an hour james didntloosen his grip on sirius arm his voice elevated and he was shouting at full volume again neither of you is ready for this you cantdamage her innocence she too young he cursed loudly and let go of sirius arm james shot a threatening look at autumn then gathered her clothes off the floor he pulled her shirt right side out and helped her pull it on then handed her the rest of her clothes to allow her to dress herself he stood and waited for her to finish mate i think we can make our own decisions we re practically been together for over four years dontyou think that long enough besides we werentactually going to do anything sirius ran a hand through his hair james responded with only a deep intimidating glare james sirius tone became considerably more serious what james shot it none of your business sirius swallowed nervously but stood up straight james turned and shoved sirius into the dresser behind him then said aggressively you and i both know her safety is my business and you should be concerned with protecting her too james glanced over at autumn and noticed she was done dressing so he briskly walked over swooped her up and carried her down to the common room leaving a stunned sirius behind he set her on the couch next to remus and then sat next to her so she was in between remus and himself a few minutes later sirius walked down into the common room and sat in a chair facing the couch the rest of them were sitting silently on autumn was slouched over with her chin resting in her hand james was still tense with fury and remus was anxiously waiting for someone to speak sirius cleared his throat and calmly said james you have no right to do this autumn and i have known each other for long enough and you know there nothing wrong with it you re just over protective of autumn and that understandable to a point you need to let her go james didntrespond autumn placed a hand on james cheek jamsie i can take care of myself and if i can t you know sirius would do anything for me autumn said in a soothing voice james placed his face in his hands and didntmove autumn moved her hand to gently rub circles on his back she glanced over at sirius and smiled lightly james sat up straight and autumn noticed tears welling up in his eyes he quickly stood up and walked out of the common room after he left there was a silence shared among the three teenagers for a minute until sirius sighed he ll come around sirius said to autumn i dontwant him to be angry with us autumn said obviously distressed remus pitched in by noting prongs is only worried that he going to lose his two best friends to each other why hello there in case you all are wondering i am in my freshman year of college now i wrote the plans for this story in 7th grade and i am currently majoring in english although like many freshmen there is a great chance that will change why did you take so long to start writing again i answered this in my last chapter but i shall answer it again i somehow managed the task of getting an extremely beautiful boy to kiss me on the night of october 11th 2008 and we ve been together since then coincidentally that is about when my writing stopped it was much easier to write about a romance when i wasntliving one anyway he currently reading it and he up to chapter oh i not sure but he working on it i both embarrassed and flattered he compliments me even though my story was so poorly written back in the day sigh anyway enough about me how are you to my loyal reviewers i cantbelieve you ve stuck around i shocked stunned

over and she was walking to meet the marauders outside of their last class of the week she peeked over the crowd hoping to catch a glimpse of sirius tall figure autumn a familiar voice called through the crowd autumn jumped with excitement and began to run in the direction of the voice once autumn reached sirius she jumped up and wrapped her legs around his torso well hello there sirius smiled obviously teasing her for her enthusiasm hello to you too fall girl james said sarcastically and waved autumn purposely ignored james and ruffled sirius hair how was your class black autumn asked with sirius still holding her up oh it was fantastic thanks for asking james said in a playfully sarcastic tone again shut up potter no one asked you autumn turned back to sirius it was alright but peter fell asleep on our project and drooled on it sirius answered and peter blushed ooh autumn can you get off sirius grunted autumn nodded and stood up on her own should i lay off the chocolate frogs autumn giggled no it just hurt a little bit sirius frowned and rubbed his lower abdomen want me to kiss it autumn said with an exaggerated wink james and remus both pretended to gag but seriously do you want me to take you to the hospital wing to get it checked out autumn asked no i the strongest man on earth sirius bellowed then swooped autumn up in his arms and ran down the corridor they reached the entrance to the common room when sirius set autumn down and raised an eyebrow we have two choices at this point we could walk into gryffindor and sit around the fire exchanging polite conversation or we could head up to the astronomy tower and celebrate our three month montiversary sirius grinned suggestively autumn giggled well you know how much i love polite conversation sirius i think i ll just she took a step toward the entrance just go ahead and walk in here sirius cut her off and picked her up carrying her giggling self up to the astronomy tower once they reached the tower sirius set autumn down and then collapsed on the floor panting like a dog i guess you re not exactly the strongest man on earth eh autumn teased you re more of a whimpering boy i am not a boy nor do i whimper sirius protested i can make you whimper autumn said seductively and straddled sirius who was still lying on the floor sirius shivered she lowered her body down to his and moved up slightly she went to kiss him but pulled away just as her lips barely grazed his sirius whimpered see i knew i could make you whimper she then noticed sirius face scrunched in pain he groaned sweetie did i hurt you sorry autumn can you get off sirius asked glumly autumn got off sat next to sirius and watched him clutch his lower abdomen for the second time that day is it in the same place as your scar autumn asked yeah i think so sirius groaned here let get up i ll help you to the hospital wing autumn said and gently pulled sirius up they walked slowly down many stairs and through a corridor until sirius stopped and ran into the boys bathroom autumn heard retching through the door and she tapped her feet and shook her hands out nervously then gave up and ran in after him you alright in there she called into the stall uhg yeah just give me a second after a few minutes the two of them were finally able to begin walking towards the hospital wing again and upon arriving madame clark hurriedly took over autumn was immediately shooed out of the wing so she sat outside anxiously soon joined by the other three marauders after a couple very nerve wracking hours including thirty minutes autumn spent banging on the hospital wing doors madame clark came out smiling he absolutely fine the poison from his wound was apparently not entirely extracted but it was such a small amount that it was simple to conjure it all out the only thing he has to worry about now is not getting his pulse up too high as it ll shoot pain through the area in which he has the scar madame clark beamed at her good work and walked back into the wing autumn smiled immediately autumn responded only by standing up and confidently walking into the hospital wing 888888888888888 aw baby are you feeling any better autumn asked politely and sat next to the just woken sirius on his bed yeah actually nothing hurts until i get too worked up which hasntreally happened yet sirius smiled that good sweetie i bet i can make it all better autumn said with a hint of seduction then moved to straddle sirius i was thinking dontyou think we re ready to you know take it to the next step she bent down and purred something into his hear that caused his eyes to bulge uhh sirius began but then groaned in a sudden shock of pain ooh you did that on purpose sirius moaned yes but i so sorry i couldnthelp myself is the pain gone yet yeah yup i think it ebbing away sirius said with closed eyes trying to slow his heart autumn giggled and dismounted sirius you re laughing at my pain only a little bit it kind of cute autumn grinned dontbe so pleased with yourself you didntmake my heart rate shoot up that much sirius smiled despite himself oh really autumn said and slid her hand up sirius leg slowly autumn voice dropped again well we ll just have to change that she slid her hand up further and with her other hand she grazed the bottom of his abdomen sirius yelped in pain again dontever question my seduction skills again autumn smiled then kissed sirius lightly on the cheek and walked out of their dorm she spotted james and remus sitting by the fireplace so she went and joined them you two are awfully quiet she noted james handed her the newspaper he was reading that because there isntgood news james answered solemnly autumn scanned the article that james was reading seventy people autumn said with a terrified look in her eyes both muggles and wizards autumn it a war a few of you asked if my having a boyfriend would cause a hiatus no why because it already did sillies what did you think that year without updating was for he and i have separated for the time being which is good news for you more updating of this story and yes this was a bit of a filler chapter as the last couple chapters have been but things pick up next chapter seriously we re starting to get into the parts of the plot that i ve been planning since i first started writing this story things get scary things get intense thanks to all my reviewers for growing up with me and my characters o snowflake prongsette o i apologize ahead of time for how short this chapter is forgive me i a college kid this particular chapter is dedicated to kerry and cassie93 i love you both to kerry i think i cried when fruits basket ended to cassie93 ehehe thank you manipulating sirius is crazy fun and there more of it in this rather brief chapter enjoy chapter 56 pants havoc was wreaked in every corner of the world between wizards and muggles alike autumn noticed the school slowly emptying as parents took their children out of classes the mood of the common room was somber autumn and the marauders sat around the fireplace on a snowy december day do you suppose you re coming to my place over break fall girl james asked autumn smiled at the nickname and nodded she noticed a couple sitting on a loveseat near them whispering the daily prophet aloud to each other james head snapped up as he too noticed this could you two pricks read that bloody paper somewhere else james sneered and the couple scurried up to the boys dorm quite shocked by james rare fit of anger dontget too worked up jamesie autumn said soothingly with a light smile people just need to make sure they dontrecognize names in the articles james rubbed his temples i know i just hate hearing about death everywhere i go sirius nudged james comfortingly and he took his fingers off his temples think about break instead peter suggested james sighed and nodded autumn moved out of the chair and went to sit next to sirius on the couch she promptly leaned against his shoulder and closed her eyes the room was silent for a while do you suppose hogwarts will stay open with so many students leaving remus asked breaking the silence dumbledore ll fight to keep hogwarts open as a safe zone for its students the parents pulling their kids out are idiots james frowned and the rest of them nodded in agreement let go to dinner and try to put our minds on food autumn suggested taking her head off sirius shoulder sirius agreed and stood up before autumn holding his hands out in order to help her up i not particularly hungry james said and the other two marauders nodded autumn shrugged and the couple walked out of the common room clasping hands as they sat down in their regular spot sirius sighed and looked for something to lighten the mood he spotted a blond are you checking her out autumn asked with a slight smile absolutely i am sirius turned to autumn and smiled then looked concerned for a moment am i not supposed to do that when you re my girlfriend autumn just laughed no if i stopped you from looking at girls i d be taking away everything that makes you sirius black it alright as long as you let me do the same autumn grinned mischievously uhh sure go ahead sirius cleared his throat autumn began to scan for attractive boys it didnttake her long ah there one mmmm i wouldntmind him autumn said with a sly smile sirius did the opposite of what autumn expected he burst out in laughter what on earth is so funny autumn frowned disappointed that her attempt at making him jealous had failed you only think he hot because he looks just like me he does not autumn frown etched deeper he my little brother he your what autumn looked at him in shock sirius smiled you re joking i absolutely not regulus has been my little brother since birth some fifteen years ago autumn mouth dropped do the boys know you have a younger brother she asked of course they do how could they not know after six years sirius teased you never told me you had a brother maybe you should have asked dontfeel so bad i purposely donttalk about him he in your house and is on an obvious path to corruption so anyway i think you dontthink anyone is smokin hot who doesnthave my perfect gene pool sirius smirked autumn snapped out of her shocked expression er she looked around again ooh how about him autumn winked in his direction no avery on our team you cantthink he hot do i sense jealously at last autumn grinned point taken no thinking anyone else is hot he paused how am i going to face him now that i know you want to get in his pants sirius pouted oh black you know your pants are the only pants i can see myself in autumn said suggestively sirius scooted closer to his girlfriend mmm how would you like to take this opportunity to do exactly that in the broom cupboard sirius put his hand on her inner thigh autumn sat up straighter and cleared her throat nervously our first time cantbe in a damn broom cupboard but maybe if we head back to your room autumn trailed off stood up and walked backwards with a wink sirius followed immediately 888888888888888 autumn ran down the stairs of the dorm rooms into the common room sirius following in only his underpants james began laughing once he saw autumn what in the tangles of merlin beard did you do to him james snickered looking down at the abnormally large dress pants autumn was wearing autumn laughed a bit out of breath i told him i d get into his pants so i took them off him put them on myself and then promptly ran away from the sex craved pants less

my chapters you have no idea how grateful i am of you thanks for the awesome feedback it kind of funny that i made the chapter have the word chicken in it when u are a vegetarian glad u liked it thanks again this is my absolute faveorite chapter so far it is really cheesy at the end but i think it cute all the same d disclaimer i keep forgetting i dontown it it jkr s well except a few characters like autumn and the dad and mom and bianca i ll shut up now chapter 6 siriusly a lifesaver but i decided i d make the train ride worthwhile and so i did i wasntsitting with the luggage this time oh no this time i was sitting with the next worse thing the marauders yep you read right i was actually going to sit with the marauders no i wasntgoing to sit and reason over tea my plan was to give them a piece of my mind something that i ve wanted to do for so long well i guess i should tell you how it went then huh after getting all my stuff put away i headed straight for the farthest back compartment on the right in the train that where the marauders always sat i stood in front of the door took a deep breath and slammed open the compartment door not frowning but not looking really happy either i think i made a dramatic enough entrance because lupin potter and pettigrew all jumped and pettigrew even squeaked well that could have been my imagination but after all he is a rat heh whatta you want potter asked to talk to you guys i said simply and when they didntanswer i just sat down making sure to look at the seat before i sat just in case lupin raised an eyebrow i gave a little smile how life i asked lupin he blinked good good then i turned to potter for the kill why do you hate me he blinked too what was it with the marauders and blinking i don t he asked more than said you dontsound too sure of that i said sitting up straight well i am he said so you dont hate me then why do you torment me and drag away my only friend he didntsay anything he had too much dang pride to say anything lupin flinched at the last comment but i decided to ignore it and move on then i laughed and said through my laughter see if you understand this i calmed down i know something you dontknow that i know about you potter blinked you re weird ah you wouldntsay that if you knew that i know he tilted his head what do you know stuff oh thanks that tells me a whole lot no problem and to my surprise he smiled not the marauder mischievous smile but the genuine you make me laugh smile i smiled back dontworry it also wasntthe flirty smile but it was the i don t hate you as much as it may seem smile lupin coughed to get our attention i turned yes i think i know what you know he opened his mouth to say more but i said be careful there lupin you might tell me something you dontwant me to know that i dontalready know i smirked confusing him more potter interrupted damnit vilcent what do you know he demanded i guessed he had a clue to what i knew other wise he wouldntbe as testy i grinned let just say that now pettigrew here is really funny to me i said motioning towards pettigrew just then potter lunged towards me and punched me in the nose i yelped and grabbed my nose which was bleeding pettigrew finally said something you hit a girl then he grinned do it again potter raised his fist but i kicked him in the stomach go me lupin fumbled for his wand and first stopped the bleeding with a spell then cleaned me up and then cleaned the seat that got all bloodied up thanks then i turned to glare at potter what the bloody hell was that for lupin cringed and peter twitched potter stayed stiff with pride for insulting my friend he said simply ah yes he cantstand up for himself right the stag standing up for the rat they all froze they kind of got the idea i kind of knew but that finished it lupin went completely pale i felt really bad for him how long have you known potter asked politely this time months he closed his eyes and sighed what else do you know not much oh so you don t he looked at lupin no i know about remus i said using his first name because it sounded like an appropriate time to make it sound like i could be slightly trusted potter scratched the back of his head and then ruffled his hair sorry i mumbled looking at lupin damn right you should be he said still calm i was looking at the floor not talking it was silent for a very long while i didntdare to look at remus yes i ll call him by his first name now because i didntknow what i d see finally i had the guts to mumble how many people know besides you guys he sighed and pointed at me just me he nodded and i shut up and looked back at the floor then remus spoke up i sorry you had to find out you must he trailed off remus i dontthink of you any differently i swear he nodded but it didntlook like he believed me no really i don t if i did i wouldntbe sitting by you see diagram at bottom it ok remus i told you i don t and you have to trust me i said no longer at a mere whisper he gave a very slight cringe and nodded ok he still didntsound like he believed me but i ended it finally potter looked up and glared at me you canttell a soul you know that i ve known for months do you really think no you have to promise me you wonttell anyone he said raising his voice i jumped and replied of course not i wonttell i donthave anyone to tell we all went silent again then i said looking forward to third year not anymore potter replied and why not because i will constantly have blackmail hanging over us i wouldntuse that as blackmail what kind of person do you think i am he shrugged i dontknow you how would i know well you might have known me if you didntimmediately assume i was an evil slytherin i snapped you shouldntbring things like that up during a time like this he mumbled well what if i think it important and what if i don t he stood up challenging me and what if i do i stood up to face him then the door opened it was black smiling his smile faded when he saw me we both immediately sat down and glared at each other um what going on what the hec did i miss black asked squishing next to potter and pettigrew after shutting the door she knows about us being animagus and about moony potter said and black stared at me for a while and then broke out into a grin randomly so doctor what should we do with her my eyes widened and i scooted back in my seat then he laughed potter stared at him this isntfunny sirius potter snapped i know i am sirius you know potter rolled his eyes and went back to slumping in his seat with his arms crossed glaring at me i just returned the action without slumping in my seat it seems like you guys have it under control so i figured i d add a bit of humor to the glare a thon black said motioning towards potter and i neither of us stopped glaring stop it it fraking me out he said waving a hand between us then we both turned to glare at him he glared at both of us in turn after a few seconds we all started laughing remus and pettigrew included after the laughing died down it seemed like we had broken the ice for some reason we all forgot i knew something i shouldntknow about them and was a slytherin and we all just started talking and joking and laughing like good friends of course sirius yes i ll call them all by their first names now didntforget to mention that i had stolen his seat but that was forgotten soon when the train finally stopped i had to be pulled out of the compartment by sirius who is quite strong actually to tell you the truth so it wasntmuch of a fight i ll write ok to all of you whether you like it or not and if i dontget an answer i ll cry then write more letters until you are sick of me and my handwriting altogether sirius laughed and said i ll write back unless i cantfind you or i forget a n sorry i had to put that little shrek2 quote into it p the rest nodded and left then it was just remus and i remus i ll write to you too ok and please dontthink i think of you any differently just because you got bitten against your control if dumbledore is ok with it then so am i he grinned and nodded thanks autumn bye then we both went our separate ways the end a n hahahahah just kidding it not the end it just sounded so cheesy i couldnthelp it ok so i lied it wasnta week before i posted it was less but i dontthink you could possibly hate me for that could you hehe moonlightwitch yes i have thought about lily but i ve decided james isntinterested in lilt at all right now and he wontbe until 4th or 5th year so i might stick her in the story a bit until then but for now i ll leave her to her own story good question i ve been wanting to answer that for a while midnight pixie darnit i missed the hp1 extended on tv i saw the commercials and everything ug anywhoo ya i thought the the end was just perfect for the moment i couldnthelp it d llamaperson thanks i love your username llama excuse my hyperness ness ness ness hahahahaha glitch in story you may have noticed in tha last chapter i said i would put a diagram at the bottom i forgot d i was too excited to get the chapter posted disclaimer the characters are not mine so it shall not be said as mine as it is not mine because if it were mine it would say it were mine but i am telling you that it is not mine at all i laugh in your general direction you english folk and wipers of other peoples bottoms if you saw monty python and the holy grail you would get that and if you haventseen it go see it now chapter 7 fishies and ghosts now it seems to me that you know just what to say but words are only words can you show me something else can you swear to me that you ll always be this way lonely no more rob thomas over the summer i spent as less time as i could inside the house and as much time as i could with my owl in the park i still hadntcome up with a name for the poor owl though but i figured the perfect name would come to me soon i wrote letter after letter in the park and sent them off to a separate marauder each week i sent most my letters to remus and then potter and sirius peter didntget many letters because he only replied a few times and when he did they were short and to the point which made it so i didntknow what to say in reply remus and i carried out long conversations through our letters mostly about what was going on in our own lives and then asking each other about each other lives i learned his favorite color was dark pink odd but cute after each letter i would grin and immediately write a reply my owl knew to deliver the letters to the park unless it was in the middle of the night then i probably wouldntbe in the middle of the park i think it was the letters that really made us all friends before summer started right after the train ride they were still uncomfortable with me but james and i couldntfight through letters so it really seemed to bond our friendship at least in my opinion some letters even made me laugh like sirius would often use the sirius serious pun i thought it was hilarious although he told me james thought it was really annoying remus would secretly make fun of peter and james liked to make fun of other slytherins which i didnthave a problem with and told him that sometime around july i got a letter from all four marauders autumn sorry about none of us replying to your letters for the past week or so we ve been at the potter manner we ve come to the decision that if you wanted you could come over it ok with mr and mrs potter so if it ok with your dad you can head over at any time just reply with your answer moony wormtail padfoot prongs aka the marauders i jumped up from the picnic bench in the center of the park and ran home with the letter clutched in my hand leaving my owl to find as many rats as she wanted i bolted through the door daaaaaaddd i yelled right when i entered the house he came out of the kitchen with a piece of toast in his hand pig i hid a grin and said dad do you think i could go over to a friends for a week or so he shook his head and walked back into the kitchen i followed him pleaaaaase dad i wontbug you for a week he shrugged then said no dad please no autumn i know whats best for you i recoiled and then ran upstairs to my room and slammed the door yeah right you know what best for me i thought as i got out my quill and ink i wrote dear marauding marauders dad said he wouldntlet me come he says he knows what best for me i wish i could come over but it looks like i trapped til fall oh well i guess we can all still write o how i despise my father i even explained to him that it would get rid of me for a week but he just shrugged and said no see you in the autumn autumn p s sirius did you catch my autumn autumn pun now you arentthe only one with a name joke for yourself p p s do any of you have any ideas for a name for my owl i waited for my unnamed owl to return from her hunt and sent the letter off she didntlook too happy to have to go fly again when she just wanted to rest too bad i so mean the next day i got a reply from james dear autumn we donthave to wait till the autumn catch the pun rolls eyes to see you because we re coming over to pick you up by floo whether you like it or not my father has good connections so we were able to connect your fireplace to the floo line have everything packed up and we ll come pick you up july 17th at 1 00pm see you then james and the marauding boys p s sirius sticks his tongue at you and we have no idea what to name your owl but we can help you decide when you come over i laughed at the last comment with sirius i could totally picture it i guess i d have to go pack leaving a very shocked father i left with the marauders who popped into my fireplace at 1 10 just like the boys to be late hehe well i learned what flooing is and how to use it even though i fell when we got there it was pretty cool the potter mansion is well a mansion and it was huge everyone got their own room and bathroom and everything else was just amazing and huge i ll stop rambling now but it was pretty cool they even had a pool in their backyard and a mini quidditch pitch i think that the only time i had ever been more excited was on my first say of hogwarts i completely forgot about people as i gawked at my surroundings i had to be nudged by remus to remember to say hello to the potters and then i had to be dragged upstairs by sirius when we reached my room i froze lets just say i dontthink i ever wanted to go home ever james tilted his head at my reaction to my room i was staring at my room smiling james then said maybe someone should give her a tour sirius volunteered and took me around the mansion asking me different questions bout how long are you planning on staying um a week i guess or whenever you guys kick me out because i get annoying he laughed well then you wouldntlast close to a week hey then we both laughed and he took me to all the other rooms in the mansion it took about two hours before we were finally done how do you know so much about this place i asked oh i live here i chuckled figuring he meant he practically lived there no really i left my house so now i live here oh sorry i just figured never mind you sure are lucky to have a friend that would be willing to take you in to his house i wish i had someone like that how long have you known james just about forever since we were toddlers at least i smiled picturing two little boys running around banging each other on the head what sirius asked raising an eyebrow i can picture two little marauders that all i grinned doing what but are you sure you really want to know i said raising an eyebrow scaring him what he said worried no i dontthink so common are both you and james this pushy sheesh i just picture two little babies in diapers running around banging each other on the head with pots and pans he laughed i can picture that too then we were both silent picturing little marauders ok enough of that let go meet back up with the rest of the marauders i grinned and we walked up to where the marauders were meeting all in one room before we got into the hallway where the marauders were sirius shushed me and tip toed into the hallway i followed and did the same i saw that sirius was grinning so i figured he d probably somehow jump in and scare them he motioned for me to wait and i did he walked a bit further took out his wand and waved it muttering something and then pointed it at the room suddenly the hall was full of yelling and in peter case screaming sirius muttered run i giggled and we bolted back down the stairs we ran to the back of the mansion and i finally saw the backyard up close sirius opened the sliding door that led to the backyard and motioned for me to go through it he followed and quietly shut the door and walked on the path that led to a sort of fruit tree forest there he sat on a rock in the shadows and motioned for me to do the same on a rock across from his he let out a breath which made it seem like he was holding his breath the whole time then he laughed i did too that was weird what did you do i asked still laughing i i put live fish in their underpants i stared at him like he was a crazed lunatic for a while and then started laughing again we kept laughing like this to the point that we had both fallen off our rocks and were clutching our sides it wasnteven that funny but it was a laughing kind of moment we kept laughing until we heard someone running towards us through the laughing we both abruptly stopped laughing and stood up he whispered follow me and ran swiftly between the trees and into the shadows where i couldntsee him anymore i followed him and looked for him everywhere but he had disappeared i panicked he sure was fast i stopped for a few seconds to look around when i felt a tap on my shoulder and twirled around to see nothing i held my breath and looked around h hello i said worried i saw a branch snap in front of me as if a ghost stepped on it and it left multiple footprints past me and in the direction sirius went i let out the breath i was holding and ran back to the mansion well more like bolted to the mansion into the house up the stairs and allll the way into my room i sat on my bed and thought what the hec i waited for about a half hour before i got worried yes i know crummy friend i am you donthave to tell me and decided to go see what was going on i walked down stairs and into the kitchen that led to the backyard and saw the marauders eating sandwiches at the table i put my hands on my hips what did i miss oh everything james said through a mouth full of food you missed the ghost they all started laughing sirius included ok but really what did i miss they all chuckled again and remus motioned for me to sit in a chair with a full sandwich in front of it my parents are out so you re looking at dinner james told me yes but the question is do i trust dinner they all went silent what did you do to it then they all laughed again i personally made sure they didntdo anything to it i shrugged and sat down then asked sirius how could you perform magic outside of school james began to answer but i cut him off telling him i asked sirius and not him hehe oh he put down his sandwich and swallowed mr and mrs potter have good connections this place is approved for under age wizardry all the marauders shot him a glare wha oh then he grinned bashfully and said never mind i laughed nice then how are you guys stopped from having duels every 5 seconds they shrugged and we all finished out food in peace so you guys like fish remus james and peter shot me a glare while sirius and i shared a good laugh o you ll pay for that vilcent james said referring to me by my surname again i stuck my tongue out at him and grinned it felt good having friends even if they threatened to get me back for something somebody else did i see you are still reading my story but why are you reading the note at the bottom of the page it never contains anything worth reading sheesh you must really have no life because you are reading what comes after the story hehe well as long as you are reading i might as well tell you that in the next chapter there will be perhaps the funniest part of all the chapters if i type it right d i originally wanted the funny part to be in this chapter but this chapter was already about the longest out of all my chapters so i save it for later i will post before monday but it will probably be before then and you are still reading the footnotes what kind of bored person with no life person are you i command you to stop reading now you are still reading then i have only one choice to stop typing things for you to read excuse my hyperness again i shall shut up now stops typing still typing ha you are still reading are you calling me a liar because i didntstop typing well i ll show you moonlightwitch yes lily is important i love having lily in stories but i decided to wait till fourth year be patient she will be in a lot so dontyou worry i just dontwant her to come rushing into the story otherwise autumn would be pushed aside and wait that nice i like that ha i ll put lily in somewhere in 3rd year muahahahaha kalinerst thank you i not planning on stopping i the kind of person that never gives up i got it from my dad d kara hehe i own all three harry potters on dvd and the first two on vhs too so far my fave chapter is chapter 6 because i like arguing heh hopefully it ll only get sweeter pen2paper nice username thanks chapter 8 random fights i walk a lonely road the only one that i have ever known dontknow where it goes but its only me and i walk alone i walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams boulevard of broken dreams green day o you ll pay for that vilcent james said referring to me by my surname again i stuck my tongue out at him and grinned i changed into pjs and walked into my personal bathroom how cool is this to brush my teeth finally after an exhausting day i climbed into bed and tried to fall asleep but that not something i can do easily ever since i was little i used this time to think about everything going on in my life good and bad so it would usually take me about an hour to fall asleep so i stared at the ceiling and thought about how fortunate i was at that moment i was sleeping in a queen size bed with house elves that clean so i donthave to although i wasnttoo happy to find out they had unpaid servants but that not my business finally i closed my eyes and dozed off of course i dontremember what happened next because i was asleep but i do remember how i woke up there was a loud bang and my eyes snapped open i didntdare move but i looked around as far as i could see lying down that is i noticed that my door had flung open i held my breath i ll admit it the word ghost was rushing through my head at that moment it a very muggle thing to think but after all i was considered a muggle longer than a witch my bed shook now i sat up my heard beating faster than a hamster on wheels a n sorry that an inside joke i couldnthelp myself nicole i was far from tired now my eyes were wide open looking for anything to run away from but then i heard a mumbled ah what the and in a blink of the eye three marauders were standing by my bed i screamed and fell off my bed on the other side of where the marauders were i stood up quickly and glared at them you guys had better be able to run fast i said simply waiting for them to run and they did were they scared of me that would be the day james peter and remus bolted out of my door and down the stairs before i chased them though i walked over to the spot they appeared at and found a cloak i decided it was shiny and i wanted to hide it from them so i tucked it under my mattress then bolted out my door and down the stairs headed after the three marauders i heard someone running behind me and looked back to find sirius figures he couldntmiss out on action we entered the kitchen and were immediately pelted with assorted food sirius immediately got into it he grabbed whatever he could find and mind you it wasntall things you should be throwing around the house and chucked it at the other three marauders i figured i d stick to food as far as i can remember that was the best being woken up at 1 am i had ever experienced i dontthink i ever did experience a good time when i was woken up in the middle of the night come to think of it anyways the food fight eventually ended when we found peter slumping on the counter asleep it took all of us carrying him to get him upstairs on top of the fact that we were all covered in slimy gross food when we finally got him to his room we were completely exhausted more than we had been before so we plopped him in the middle of the room not really caring anymore all that mattered now was good ol sleep how i fell asleep or how i got to the couch downstairs will remain unknown to me when i opened my eyes and blinked a few times i found myself lying on a gold couch alongside other sofas and couches with 2 marauders also sleeping i sat up and got out of bed figuring i should probably take a shower i looked over to the kitchen which was right across the living room a n forgive me if family room is the wrong term for some reason i always get family and living room mixed up i found james walking around with his wand cleaning up the kitchen what time is it he turned and pointed his wand at me i raised an eyebrow sorry you scared me he lowered his wand it about six six six i sighed need help nope it just about done thanks i nodded and said think we should wake them up i grinned he smiled sure james walked over to the sink grabbed a pitcher filled it up with water and walked over to me classic i told him still grinning ladies first he said as he handed me the pitcher i smiled sirius or peter hmmm tough decision not really i walked over to sirius and dumped half the water in the pitcher on his head he immediately woke up falling onto the floor and he yelled out about three different cuss words mixed into one word i laughed and walked over to the amazingly still sleeping peter and handed the pitcher to james who was waiting next to him he grinned and quickly poured the water onto peter head he blinked a few times lazily as if he were used to have water poured on his head while sleeping what time is it peter asked around six thirty i replied both peter and sirius who had calmed down a bit and had dried himself off sighed then why d you wake us up sirius asked running a hand through his hair because it fun and we wanted to make you mad i stated plain out and simple he sneered and threw a pillow at me i caught it and threw it back at him he caught it and threw it back at me i reached down grabbed it and threw it even harder at him james yelled stop and threw a pillow at sirius sirius laughed and threw both pillows he was holding at james james then threw one pillow at me and one back at sirius i held the pillow and said you guys never give up do you they all replied nope i laughed good i threw the pillow at peter who seemed to forget he was a wizard and was ringing his shirt out he got hit by the pillow threw it and cringed that started the pillow fight i dontknow how many random fights we went through in the next few days but they included snowball fights magically provided water fights pool provided more food fights refrigerator provided and more pillow fights it was all sirius fault i swear but i do remember how it all ended after coming out of the pool we all lounged on picnic tables that were placed under cover i sat next to remus and we were arguing about who just won the water fight did too i said did not remus argued did didn t how could you have won you were hiding under water the whole time was not was too why do you think i couldnthave won because because yes because because why because because because because why remus glared then we both laughed well that sounds familiar doesntit i laughed yep what so funny over there sirius asked from another table oh we were just talking about this new device that makes nosey people ask what funny remus laughed in surprise at my spunky ness sirius blinked and then he got it hey i shrugged you asked he sneered playfully and went back to talking to the other two marauders we were silent for a few seconds and then remus said can i ask you a serious question why would you ask me a sirius question i dontknow anything about sirius that you dontknow he gave a fake laugh hilarious he said sarcastically no i mean it sure what why does it not bother you that i a werewolf and dontgive me some cheesy answer i

rambling no go on he insisted ok well there isntmuch else to say remus the truth is the answer is cheesy he nodded and zoned out in a different direction can i ask you a serious question he snapped

peter sirius and james turned to remus on my way out what the bloody hell was that about james asked remus sighed it was the next day and i was leaving somewhere deep inside me i was sad to leave but on the outside i was glad to get away from them i was packing and was almost done when someone knocked i ignored it they knocked again i sighed what could i come in came sirius voice no he opened the door i said no what if i was indecent he shrugged and i threw a pillow at him angrily what do you want you re not going to tell anyone are you he said referring to being illegal animagus and remus being a werewolf i told you on the train i dont have anyone to tell i glared at him for just thinking about himself good so that it just about great now get out ooo harsh why are you so mad because that the only reason i here just so there is no chance of me telling that really stupid because forced friendships dontwork out it not true that that the only reason you are here it was in the beginning but if it was really only to befriend you so you wouldnttell then we wouldnthave gotten into all those weird fights and pranks because that would be risking you getting angry right i shrugged he was right you can leave today if you want and never get the chance to have friends at hogwarts you re trying to guilt me into staying yep is it working a little bit good think it over wait i said and he turned how did you guys all become friends you re all so different he grinned mischievously except that you ve all got a different version of that smile and mine the hottest i rolled my eyes no i serious wait don t how can you be sirius i sirius i rolled my eyes again just answer the question but i couldnthelp a smile come slightly to my lips i dunno were all too cool for the rest of the school i raised my eyebrows at him i dontknow you cantexplain why people are friends i sighed maybe because you re all idiots i muttered to myself hey i heard that no you didn t i didn t nope i grinned wait i confused sirius tilted his head ha you should be um er so are you going to finish packing dunno do you want me to finish packing well peter is leaving tomorrow for his sick mother and we need another marauder to replace him where are you going to find a replacement he shrugged i chuckled is it ok with james and his parents ya i already talked to him i smiled sweetly ok then yey he grabbed the pillow that i had thrown at him earlier threw it at me and did a very odd dance around the room sirius yep you re scaring me muahahahahaha sirius ok ok but i know why you arentleaving it because you couldntleave a pretty face like mine he said circling his face with his hand you arrogant git you know i had to admit he i did look kind of cute when he was happy wait what am i thinking i just too cool for you he said in defense and jokingly huffed off when i finally decided to come down stairs i brought my wand with me living with the marauders for a week teaches you to always be vigilant 24 7 a n constant vigilance heh i got downstairs and held my breath the weird thing is nothing happened i loosened my grip on my wand and walked to the backyard oh good they were swimming again i was afraid they would pop up and throw a chicken leg at me i ran back upstairs and changed into my swimsuit as fast as i could i ran down the stairs with a towel wrapped around my bottom half it was a one piece so it didntlook weird try to picture a 2 piece with a towel wrapped around it i walked over to the pool sat and stuck my legs in the water i see you decided not to leave yeah sirius said it is ok with you yeah he asked me before hand peter is upstairs packing i smiled they smiled back no they grinned back no that was their mischievous grins i took a foot out of the water prepared to back away slowly then james went under james i mean common i wasntstupid he was going to pop up and either pull me in or splash me to death i looked under for a while trying to catch him before he caught me with my foot still in the water then i saw james pop up at the end of the pool james that was not i got cut off because while i was looking to my left sirius snuck up to my right and pulled me in when i finally came up i took a deep breath splashed him and dove back underwater i swam a fair distance from him and came back up i have pretty good lungs i saw the three marauders start to plan something so i came up with my own idea i went under for a few seconds came back up and started coughing then as i was coughing i took one more cough silently took a deep breath and sank under i opened my eyes underwater and looked in the direction the marauders were in to see if they were coming they probably figured it out oh well i tried to relax because if you have ever won a holding your breath contest you should know you have to relax i decided to go a bit deeper and lose my relaxation for a second i went to the bottom using my hands to keep myself down and relaxed again they still didntcome what kind of jerks are they my lungs started to really hurt just a bit longer it wonttake me that long to swim back up my lungs felt as if they would burst i started to swim back up i reached about halfway i blacked out i woke up coughing with my mouth against something which didntmake it much easier to hack the water out of my lungs it went away and i shot up trying to cough why was i coughing i didntopen my eyes i had a huge headache and i took long raspy breaths with my head in my hands i heard someone talking but i blocked it out all that mattered now was air i felt like crying because i couldntremember what happened hec i couldnteven remember who or where i was at that moment finally i calmed down and opened me eyes james remus and sirius were sitting around me with worried expressions sirius even looked a little embarrassed then it all flooded back to me i such an idiot well i figured i looked like an idiot because i drowned myself the three boys let out a huge sigh in unison i blinked erm what happened i asked breathlessly well james started um you sorta you re alive remus hugged me um remus i think i want air more than the air squeezed out of me thanks i said with a raspy voice ya sorry remus blushed sirius still hadnttalked did peter leave ya i think so james said i looked at all of them you guys donthave your wands how am i how did i sirius turned beet red sirius preformed cpr james said grinning didntyou he said in the kind of voice you talk to a baby with and pinched sirius cheek i blushed slightly also well i guess it the duty to keep guests of your house alive huh sirius didntanswer huh james asked what he lives here james chuckled he only wishes he lived here did he tell you he did er ha you ll have to excuse him he never wants to admit he lives with that family i decided not to push the subject ew i have sirius germs i waited for the sirius serious pun to come out aw common sirius i only joking james face turned into a disgusted shocked sort of look you are you enjoyed it ewwww i couldnteven feel it i just meant i ew i blushed i still expected sirius to crack some joke why woulnthe crack a joke it not natural i looked at the floor all red that was scary which was worse the drowning or the sirius kissing you james grinned wider that wasnta kiss both sirius and i exclaimed sirius finally talking denial james exclaimed wha did you guys do draw straws to see who would save my life james raised his eyebrows and shook his head did you guys threaten to kill sirius james laughed well then how did you guys decide who up for
