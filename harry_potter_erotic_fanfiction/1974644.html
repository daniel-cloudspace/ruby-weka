 summer h p boy who lived year 7 summer prologue looking back this is prologue leading into part one of harry potter seventh year fic harry potter boy who lives a seventh year fic featuring harry hermione as a couple and ginny draco as a couple in this very original fic that i came up with in july of 2004 long before hbp the farce came out in july 2005 or when dh the wthwst seventh year finale of a masterpiece gone sour after coming up with those brilliant five books previous came out summer of 2007 the war is over voldemort has been vanquished harry has to learn to live with the fall out of that he gets several surprises along the way like slowly getting who he lost back into his life after acting out against his elders and after lupin pleas to the powers that be he deals with his love for hermione discovers there is more to her than meets the eye since he has never asked her a personal question since he has known her so her family history comes as a shock to him he learns more about his father side of the family and his mother s what he learns shocks him ginny has done the impossible she has managed to break through the ice in draco heart and will eventually bring about the ultimate truce between two mortal enemies to put this in easier terms harry is no longer going to be alone anymore and for once he gets everything that has been denied him where as draco loses everything family wealth power get the picture oh and i tend to throw the whole canon thing out the window it just not my thing to go all carbon copy with any of my writing this is harry and the gang real time in real situations so yeah the timeline is different but then the story flows better that way and everything is explained as the story goes along so happy reading i believe in rewarding a character for a job well done unlike others who seem to get off on harry suffering by taking away everything and everyone one by one i for one dontbelieve in that line of thinking and that the way this story is going to go harry potter was now seventeen and finally free of he who must not be named but at what cost luna lovegood and ron weasley two of his best friends had both died luna by the hands of a deatheaters lucius malfoy and bellatrix lestrange ron by the hands of lord voldemort neville was still in st mungo because he had taken a curse that was meant harry but he was going to make a full recovery not to mention that half the da and he had just recently been released from there as well he closed his eyes to ward off some of the pain of losing ron his best friend and thought back to that final day of sixth year when the end of the year feast had gotten uninvited guests in the end it had come down to voldemort and himself only the dark lord was not playing fair and had lucius malfoy and bellatrix lestrange take ron and hermione hostage he had been helpless to do nothing but endure curse after dark curse from the dark lord his scar had hurt so badly that pain hadntbeen a factor anymore he had just about given up when he caught sight of bellatrix using crucio on hermione and it was as if something had snapped inside him he turned his focus on bella and sent avada kedavra on her so fast that she didnteven see it coming and had no chance of blocking it hermione to his horror had crumpled like a broken rag doll and fallen down two flights of steps the final battle was being waged in and around the grand staircase there werentmany innocents at risk when the feast was over dumbledore had ordered the prefects in this case for gryffindor fifth year ginny weasley to take the students except for the senior da members back to their common rooms he then locked them all down for their own safety that was one less family member that he had to worry about although harry ron and hermione where both prefects they were also senior members of the da so they were not closed in with the others ginny even though a member of the da was a prefect and one or two were needed there to keep some kind of order ron was still being held hostage by lucius malfoy the dark lord was not pleased at all at what harry had done to bellatrix but by this point any searing pain coming from his scar was just an afterthought for him he had to focus on somehow getting ron away from malfoy if only he had been thinking clearer then what was to come might have turned out differently he remembered each in every detail of the events that followed because they were burned forever in his mind when both lucius and voldemort turned to look at the fallen bella harry sprang into action he sent stupefy at lucius malfoy the second he turned away from glaring at him he had put everything that he had into that spell so he would let go of ron the stunning spell hit him so hard that he let go of ron and went flying over the banister of the sixth floor landing onto the cold unforgiving marble floor bellow lucius had hit ron with a powerful curse and he was half out of it so he was unable to run for cover this was unfortunate for him and to harry horror voldemort sent avada kedavra straight at ron harry shouted at him to get out of the way but it was no use it hit him square in the middle of his chest killing him instantly ron was now slumped over the sixth floor banister fury like nothing harry had ever felt now flowed through his veins he wasted no time using expelliarmus to send voldemort wand flying out of his hand then without pausing he shouted accio wand and caught voldemort wand with his left hand by this time most of the battle was over it was down to just him the dark lord and their date with destiny voldemort seemed to be in complete denial when he could not call his wand back into his hands accio wand accio wand accio wand he roared but the wand did not return to him harry could hear the words of the prophecy echoing in his head neither may live as long as the other survives accio wand voldemort snarled still nothing happened you cantkill me boy you donthave that kind of power in you and no matter what dumbledore has told you i will win in the end he started to taunt harry you killed my parents my uncle sirius died because of you first luna then hermione and now ron i have nothing left to live for you have taken everything away from me his temper had exploded and he roared his fury at the dark lord voldemort still thinking that he was going to win had no idea what was to come it was as if he were running on pure instinct now he had a clear picture about what he had to do what he had been born to do pictures flashed in his mind of when he was eleven and had touched professor quirrell he knew what his touch had done to him but voldemort was immune to that wasnthe he remembered when dumbledore had told him everything after sirius had died there was something mysterious the dark lord was repelled by flowing thru his veins but was that and his mothers love enough he narrowed his eyes at voldemort i haventtouched you since my first year at hogwarts do you remember what happened then tom riddle do you remember what happened to professor quirrell do you really believe that you are immune he held up his bleeding hands to show the dark lord what was to come ever wonder why the avada kedavra curse has no effect on me why even to this day i can still survive it it because i was brought into this world to take you out and by damn i will fulfill that prophecy even if it means my death he was ready now and sprang into action petrificus totalus voldemort was now bound unable to move no not the master wormtail transformed from his rat form to his human form in front of everyone to defend his master he was bleeding badly from the wounds caused by crookshanks stupefy harry shouted stunning wormtail with voldemort wand never once taking his eyes off the dark lord still peter persisted to crawl towards his master petrificus totalus dumbledore now able to give harry a hand made it so wormtail could no longer move mobilicorpus he brought peter to where kinsley shacklebolt was standing finish it harry were the last words that he remembered dumbledore saying to him minerva mcgonagall gasped at the sound of those words as did others around her harry snapped voldemort wand in half and tossed the pieces onto the ground evanesco dumbledore used the spell to get rid of the pieces of wand no i am the dark lord i cannot be beaten voldemort roared trying to break free of his bonds silencio harry was sick of hearing his voice he ignored the voice snarling in his mind and walked up to voldemort avada kedavra harry placed his wand against voldemort chest and cast the curse then after tossing his wand to dumbledore he placed his bleeding hands onto voldemort face it was if this man no this thing were eons old his body crumbled away until there was nothing left but dust and harry didntstop until even that dust was no more this time voldemort was dead there was no way that he could ever return he remembered looking up at ron lifeless form hanging over the banister of the sixth floor and then at hermione lifeless form lying there on the second floor landing after that blackness had claimed him he woke up in st mungo nearly four weeks later july 23rd hermione was very much alive and holding his hand while keeping vigil at his bedside his heart had soared love that he had never known he could possess flowed thru him when she saw him open his eyes she let out a cry of relief and delight and threw herself into his arms she had held him for what seemed like forever never wanting to let him go then the two of them let go of their sorrow over the loss of their friends and cried until the two of them fell asleep in each other arms chapter one a family at last i do not claim any of jkr characters only that i love being able to create my own kind of mischief with her beloved characters i do not claim any other things that are owned by other companies that i may mention once and a while in the stories although the original characters and ideas are mine and i loved creating them so please review if you wish but try not to flame me too badly cindra 2004 2008 harry potter boy who lived h p boy who lives year 7 summer chapter 44 master chen lee wu one evening left before seventh year begins and what better way to spend it than being patched up in the hospital wing or meeting one of your new auror instructors in this case an ancient tibetan wizard older than dumbledore one more chapter to go before seventh year begins rory awoke in the arms of her handsome prince instinctively knowing that something had happened to her baby brother the problem was that wills had his arm placed securely around her waist sorry handsome but big sister duty calls she gently pressed on his arm i not ready to be king in five years ask me again when i thirty something he muttered in his sleep as he pulled her closer to him look granny katherine aurora is special she new to all of this yes she a princess by birth but i dontwant to overwhelm her by having her jump in with both feet i d rather she just gradually get used to the family he continued to talk in his sleep rory thought it was sweet of him to want to protect her but she wasnta delicate flower or as fragile as spun glass well if baby brother can change into an animal then so can i he isntgoing to let me go or wake up anytime soon so it worth a shot she closed her eyes and concentrated on her animal spirit within changing into a mink with cinnamon colored fur and her violet eyes in this form she easily slipped out from under his arm and jumped silently down to the floor wills muttered something in his sleep before rolling over onto his stomach and then burying his face into her pillow what a rush rory turned back to normal sweetie that a very unique method of getting some space from your other half di was fascinated by what she had just done are the walls closing in on you or is something else the matter rory looked at di portrait and then over at wills i fine with all of it even if wills doesntthink so i felt that harry needed me and this was easier than waking him up she whispered he grouchy when he doesntget his beauty sleep you re just as protective of harry james as wills is with harry di sighed the difference being henry didntget into anything like my baby brother has over the years rory grinned true very true di smiled at her i ll watch over wills you go see to harry james thanks auntie di it wonderful to have you back rory was happy that her gift was a success no it thanks to my angels that this is even possible now scoot your brother needs you di sent her off on her way with some well thought out words shrieking manor this place is off the charts there are wizarding cages with live doxy s complete with a tree for them to nest in another caged habitat filled with cornish pixies top that off with various cages of other dark arts creatures and you have a bloody zoo draco was still taking in the odd ambience of the twin home it for uncle james and his dada classes we ve found at least fifty boggarts so far our contractor likes to say that when it comes to this place there an adventure in every corner george handed them frosty cold butterbeer s yeah those redcaps were enough to send everyone fleeing the third floor angelina smirked those are nasty little buggers and we werentexpecting to find them fred walked into the parlor there could be a bit of a snag with the ferret fritters george took a bite of his meat pie fred eyebrows shot up in surprise there cantbe a problem we launch them next week at the shops what do ya mean by a snag oh nothing major one of those silly joke treats of yours broke the hbp a bit ago angelina casually bit into her own meat pie as if what she just said meant nothing fred spat out his butterbeer how could it have broken baby brother he coughed it very simple genius he ate one turned into a ferret ended on the roof twenty minutes later he reverted fell off the roof and busted his arm up in many places draco gave him a shorter version of what happened well then i ll have not animagus friendly printed on the labels fred went to go get a meat pie from the platter on one of the end tables fred you arentgetting it are you harry got really hurt angelina glared at him dontyou care dontbe daft woman of course i care that my baby brother got hurt but he should ve known not to eat anything in the workshop he took the risk and ended up busted up it just plain logic fred glared at angelina did you get your exclusive with aunt lily and uncle james gin changed the subject that i did baby sis and i got one from uncle sirius and aunt jenna on their little one as well i also got a tour of the elusive camelot wing everyplace but the twin floor and the guest quarters evidently the princesses are napping and so are the princes and their dad fred spoke between bites of his lunch they were up all night and early morning painting in their studio the boys were up all night chatting with their father and forming a plan about how to handle the current crisis that they re facing ginny gave him the scoop on why the floors were off limits why paint when it easier to just snap a photo fred frowned honestly fred you can be so dense sometimes paintings or portraits can house spirits of loved ones long gone angelina pondered rethinking why she d been seeing him for three years running who would they be painting everyone is alive and kicking fred was confused who close to the princes died exactly seven years ago today not everything has to be about personal gain draco rolled his eyes at him their mum fred didntwant to even think of what it would be like without either parent they were up all hours just to create portraits for their men now that what i call love did it work george asked hopefully like a charm ginny smiled camelot wing dromi met rory in the main common room something happened to harry so i had to slink out from under henry arm how did you like being a i was a mink for a bit what were you rory grinned at her twin i was a fox for a few minutes it was quite invigorating dromi grinned back let go see about baby brother before the boys wake up rory suggested lady and rad were sitting at the front doors of the camelot wing whining they really bonded with harry didntthey rory walked over to the doors opened one and outshot the pups down the corridor wait for us the girls gave chase hospital wing harry found himself sporting a cast from his palm to just above his elbow remind me to never sample anything in that workshop no matter how good it looks he glared up at the ceiling next time ignore ron hermione draco and ginny lily smiled down at him if you had then you would have finished your lunch and wouldnthave been tempted to eat unknown snacks ronald is off getting his school list filled it seems that he let it slip his mind that we re catching a train in the early morning hermione was curled up next to harry and in full lioness protect what hers mode lioness this he pointed at his encased arm with his good hand is not ron fault so let drop the blame game all right so you had no control over the animal form after you were transfigured into it james changed the subject i donteven remember changing just ending up on the roof harry shook his head they really outdid themselves with that one sirius smirked it not like a canary cream this is not a safe product hermione growled not safe when you re being chased by five shouting people but otherwise harmless to the normal consumer harry countered he just needs to put not animagus friendly on the label oh no absolutely not he is resting and there are no pups allowed in my hospital wing madam pomfrey could be heard shouting in the other ward dontgo getting your knickers in a twist they arentgoing to hurt him rory growled back they re just harmless baby pups that miss harry dromi echoed i see the pups have bonded with you james chuckled when the pups came bounding into the ward and hopped on the bed oh yeah it easy to bond at five and two in the morning when they had to go out not to mention that these two are so damned adorable harry laughed when they crawled all over hermione so they could both lick him in the face i sure that taking care of lady and rad will be good practice for you james and sirius smirked good practice for me if anyone needs practice it the two of you harry didntappreciate the suggestion that caring for the pups meant practicing caring for his future children he does have a point daddy rory sided with her brother harry broken leave him be dad dromi pinned her father with a look why hello ladies james gave the two of them a fatherly look did we enjoy our snooze with your boyfriends they blushed i d say they enjoyed their cuddle very much wouldntyou prongs sirius wagged his brows at james now girls ignore your uncle and father it in their nature to be cheeky gits i have no doubts that your chaperone allowed only sleeping so relax lily glared at james and sirius wills has the future on his brain and the chat with his grandmother that seriously looming in his future rory took in what had been done to harry and frowned i ate a ferret fritter one of fred new brainstorms that transfigures you into a ferret it all went bad from that point on he read the look that she was shooting him isnta canary cream enough for them do they not research the animals for their crazy ideas dromi was not pleased they chased me up onto the roof of shrieking manor and the rest is history did you know that they have fluffy and fang hanging out in their backyard harry rolled his eyes in exasperation because talking about this was getting tiresome it really is a harmless joke if everyone backs off and lets the effect of it wear off you re actually defending those bozo s after what they did to you dromi snarled he did that by eating something the twins created knowing full well that it was at his own risk rory pointed to the cast then they panicked and chased him instead of just leaving him be so i should have just let him run around wily nilly when fluffy is lying around the yard somewhere i think not hermione glared daggers at rory for questioning her actions about harry all you did by chasing him up onto the roof was got him broken yeah you should have let him be until the spell wore off fluffy is a three headed hellhound he eats fire and brimstone not animals or people rory glared back at her enough this was my fault so stand down and go to your corners harry wasntused to the whole big sister being overprotective situation i know that you re being protective but i not even upset about this i lost my urge to eat lunch when ron started moaning about his schedule and then she joined in then draco and ginny i left still hungry so a pastry on a platter looked good to me end of story so as usual you take the heat and let everyone else get off scot free rory scoffed katherine aurora it wasntdeliberate that he got hurt it just happens because its part of being harry james grinned dad no really he just loves spending time in hospital wing james ignored his sons glare i do not it just happens well when it put that way so sorry about that hermione rory was all happy and calm now no harm no foul hermione was calm now as well i still lying here you know harry found himself lick attacked by the pups at least you two care about me he ruffled their furry heads with his good hand poor baby we love you rory and dromi hugged him unfortunately for him they lost their balance and landed on his bad arm oops so sorry about that baby brother oh think nothing of it he gritted his teeth in pain nope doesnthurt a bit that it he needs his rest everyone needs to clear off hermione growled easy lioness we ll clear off for awhile and see you both at dinner james knew when to leave them be or face the wrath of hermione you mean to say that i donthave to sleep here tonight that a relief harry winced when a pup brushed his throbbing arm you can sleep in your own bed but you still have a train to catch early in the morning lily locked eyes with james dad is not going to like that he broken again his plans have to be altered that all there is no way that he can expect junior to start phase one of his auror training with a completely busted up arm james led lily out of the ward it enough of an ordeal with two good arms sirius agreed daddy are you talking physical training like muggle military boot camp rory asked muggles have it easy compared to auror training it tough work hunting dark wizards and witches they can be anywhere and in the toughest of locations that why phase one is the make or break phase of the training you can be all o in the academic or magic but that only a small part of being an auror sirius explained to the girls no wonder it rare to become and auror dromi eyed him in disbelief junior is a natural born dark wizard hunter he been doing the job since he was eleven all he needs is the phase one part of the training with ancient wizard hunter master chen lee wu he worked sirius and me so hard that we truly thought we were gonna die james thought of seeing his old master again and smiled you d crawl back home shower and head off to quidditch practice with puddlemere united lily wasntsmiling i never went through as much as you did it was always just learning ancient first aid and healing rituals no offense hon you were carrying precious cargo at the time and we were both clueless about it james pulled her close did ya hear that dromi we were precious cargo rory and dromi giggled ya think that funny do ya well you arenttoo old to be tickle tortured james narrowed his eyes at his girls i haventdone that in years sirius grinned at james you ll have to catch us first the girls grinned that sounded like a challenge to me james kissed lily on the cheek and then focused on catching his girls padfoot shall we teach these two a lesson it sure did prongs and you know what that means no mercy sirius grinned wickedly the girls took off running down the corridor james and sirius gave chase ron and luna arrived back when draco and ginny who were arranging honeydukes sweets in a big basket what did we miss this time ron pointed at the basket harry ate a ferret fritter turned into a ferret ended on the roof twenty minutes later he reverted fell off the roof and busted his arm up in many places ginny filled them in oh and fred and george tamed fluffy he like a docile puppy now she added the mood candy line to the basket so did the two of you get everything you needed draco remained focused on his jolly up present for harry did they really how did they manage to accomplish that luna was very curious about the hellhound i sure that mum patched harry up by now not to mention that he a very fast healer yes big brother we re all set for school evidently he eats fire or brimstone and has been on the wrong diet all of this time ginny answered her question and yes luna aunt lily is very good at what she does she agreed with luna other comment poor thing must have had a tummy ache all this time luna looked up at ron he wasnttrying to eat you he was just grouchy because he was in extremes ron slumped down onto one of the overstuffed chairs hermione is gonna kill me it true that because of you he did skip out on lunch but he isntblaming anyone draco picked up the basket hermione is not harry ron buried his face in his hands she goes mental when something happens to him harry on your side so relax or madame pomfrey wontlet you near him ginny growled impatiently at her brother wontlet ron see who stephen home for the day walked into the room who may i ask is that care package for it for harry ginny was the first to say something stephen swore under his breath he then took a deep calming breath before asking them his next question why is harry in the hospital wing he tested a new www inc treat and ended up broken draco after his grandfather muttered more choice words under his breath reluctantly told him the whole story and yet another freak storm brewed outside it was just a freak accident grandfather no blame is needed i ve spent the day dealing with everything and not just ministry business i had to set magazine and newspaper editors straight then it was an hour long chat with a distraught elizabeth and i also had to prepare for the arrival of one of my closest friends master chen he one of your phase one auror trainers only to come home to find harry in hospital wing because he was famished enough to risk eating something in the weasley twin workshop that settles it from now on there will be no arguing until any meal is finished stephen proclamation decree was all about ron habit of rowing with hermione during meals is that clear ronald yes your majesty ron muttered good then perhaps you ve earned the firebolt that being delivered this evening the way i see it is this you cantkeep up with harry and the others if you donthave the same broom stephen found himself hugged by ron it uncle stephen not your majesty you re family not a subject i ll try to be better i promise this is abso bloody lutely the best news i gonna go tell harry he raced out the common room doors grandfather as this is the year leading up to the 1005th anniversary of hogwarts are we going to be allowed to play quidditch draco had dreaded asking this question but the time was at hand no quidditch house cup but there will be exhibition matches with various teams on the quidditch cup circuit it just not fair to subject the other house teams to playing gryffindor stephen explained you do make a good point that ll be more of a challenge for the rest of us then so i dontmind it so much draco wasntdisappointed by his answer wills and henry had showered and raided harry wardrobe for some jeans and rugby t shirt in the color of gryffindor house any of you seen rory or dromi wills yawned they went to see about harry or that what they told mum henry spotted the basket loaded with treats whose that for harry gone and ended up in hospital wing again hasnthe wills surmised severely busted up arm this time round ate one of fred special pastries and it all went dicey after that was all that draco was going to say about that what about the no harm no foul clause henry frowned doesntapply to this case it was an accidental fall off the roof and a voluntary consumption of the ferret fritter stephen answered my guess is the girls should be on their way back here by now so it best to wait here for them i want to check on harry wills had other ideas that where we re headed you can come with us ginny chimed in sounds like a plan to me henry grinned off with the lot of you then i going to chat with diana about what she thinks about this whole mess stephen sighed it seemed that no one in the family ever wanted to listen to him these days i love you grandpa and what you say really does matter to us luna gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek thanks angel i needed that stephen hugged her back if we were to blow the lid off this entire thing granny would have a fit wills frowned your grandmother is at a quandary about what the right thing to do should they bury her husband and son with the idea that they were great men who should be seen as such should she be honest to her people about diana death that she was ordered killed by said members of the royal family or wait to come out with it during the official inquiry next spring stephen arched a brow at wills the people deserve to know the truth no matter how nasty it makes the family look henry let his feelings known i ll make sure that it comes out during the inquiry so it going to come out no matter what whatever is easiest on granny at least for now is fine by me wills had his say and left the room wait for us wills the four of them chased after him spoken like a future king stephen headed up to chat with diana several hours later in the hospital wing harry blinked five times to make sure that he wasntseeing things but the 5ft 4 inch tall ancient man of the orient was still standing by his bedside he was arranging various vials of potions pouches of fragrant exotic ingredients and other ancient looking tools alongside long menacing looking needles the ancient wore intricately embroidered wizarding robes of heavy scarlet red silk with a matching cap on his shiny baldhead he had a snowy white oriental style beard and mustache and although very old his olive complexion was virtually wrinkle free harry could feel that this man even though compact in form held great power wisdom and strength i see that the firstborn son of james finally awakens i am an old friend of the family and you are to be one of my new students ancient sea green eyes met harry own your little lioness is safe and sleeping in her own bed your friends left you some treats but chose not to wake you and took your furry charges with them harry eyed the wizard with wary eyes what are all the needles for i see that your education on ancient healing methods is sorely lacking he arched a pencil thin silver brow at him that must be corrected muggle natural medicine has something called acupuncture they use needles herbs and incense to heal patients i just didntrealize the wizarding world had similar methods of healing harry didntlike being called a dunce muggles have been stealing our ancient healing methods for centuries but the only healers that master them are not muggles at all my people help muggles and wizards alike they are taught to embrace harmonize and respect all life chen lectured him respect life got it my uh cast might make it difficult for your needles harry watched as the needles rose from the tray when chen waved his hand over them and then floated over to hover just above the cast on his arm i just know this is gonna hurt he squeezed his eyes shut as the needles melted into his cast until only of the needles were sticking out of it open your eyes young one my healing methods are not meant to hurt nor harm the needles ignited and an exotic essence filled the area around them he opened various pouches and sprinkled the ancient mix over the needles the result was the needles glowed even brighter with heat my arm getting warm harry had undergone various wizarding treatments but this one was the most relaxing and painless of them all after less than a week of treatments your arm will be completely healed i will teach you in your training the more civilized way of healing so if this occurs again you will have the knowledge about how to treat your injury properly chen handed him a cup of herbal tea now drink up your tea you will drink this with every meal as this promotes your body natural ability to heal itself he glanced at the basket loaded with treats those however much you may crave them do nothing but allow impurities to flow through your body therefore you are forbidden to consume them until i say otherwise the basket vanished harry obediently drank tea so strong that it made his eyes water but completely opened his senses the thought of no sweets wasntvery promising but who could argue with an ancient wizard i will see this as a test of my self discipline harry finished the tea when your training with me is finished you will have learned to master more than just self discipline chen added yet another sprinkle of ancient herbs to the needles kicking the heat up another notch harry felt his arm beginning to tingle as the heat and effects of the needles seemed to increase i look forward to your teachings no matter how tough they may be young one i worked your father and uncle so hard that they crawled home everyday for four months they were both in need of mental disincline but became faster stronger and wiser men because of it i have no doubt that you will remain true to your promise during your training the treatment now finished he removed the needles from his cast if it keeps me in control of myself then i all for crawling back to the common room harry felt like his arm was ten times better ah but you must then go to all of your other classes so there will be no crawling only enduring chen put away his tools harry glanced over at the ward entrance hi mum i chatting with i sorry professor you didnttell me your name his name is master chen lee wu an ancient wizard who is well into his 200th year he is wise as he is strong and very much the taskmaster lily put her palms together in front of her and bowed in welcoming to him the beautiful flower has returned and is once again blooming with life i see chen walked over and hugged her i have just the thing for the little ones a nice tea for you my son is in excellent hands chen lily smiled at him i lacked the tools to treat his arm but i see that you have brought your own my tools are my life without them i would be nothing and lost i see much of you anna and james in him there is a hint of stephen and the essence of the most ancient of our kind i shall try to rein in that side of the boy chen turned around to give harry a once over i heard that you ancient asian relic merlin appeared in the room i only speak what is true you doddering old fool chen shot back why raden considers you his most prized descendent is beyond me i for one dontsee it merlin sneered my most honorable ancestor raden never stooped to hiding inside a ring in shame so his word rings truer than yours ancient one chen smirked he knew his zinger had hit merlin where it hurt that being his ego yes well raden can just kiss me merlin started to snarl something rude but harry cut in first grandpa it is not nice to insult lord raden nor is it nice of master chen to needle you into a rude response harry took a chance and interceded between them harry james is right you two need to make nice towards each other for my sons sake lily pinned them each with a scathing look very well then a truce to help mold the boy into what he meant to become merlin held out his hand in truce agreed for the boy sake and what he is to become chen shook hands with merlin splendid now let the two of you leave my son be for awhile i ve come to spring him from hospital wing lily conjured a sling for his arm and helped him set his arm in it thanks for the treatment on my arm it really helped harry got out of bed and his mom helped him put on his robe you stuck needles in him didntyou merlin narrowed his eyes down at chen yeah he did and it did wonders my arm feels loads better harry gave his first gramps a look that warned him not to start anything up again when one is healing an injury like his arm potions are not always the correct path chen paused in the doorway yes well even my eldest daughter is fascinated by your ancient healing methods perhaps i need to give it more of a chance merlin sighed in reluctant acceptance come merlin i will show you a better way to heal things such as broken bones chen and merlin both vanished from the ward uh mum i starving is it dinnertime yet harry stomach growled in protest do to lack of food how does dinner in our family wing sound that way you can eat in your room if you want to lily put her arm around him as they left the ward chapter 45 hogwarts a history i do not claim any of jkr characters only that i love being able to create my own kind of mischief with her beloved characters i do not claim any other things that are owned by other companies that i may mention once and a while in the stories although the original characters and ideas are mine and i loved creating them so please review if you wish but try not to flame me too badly cindra 2004 2008
