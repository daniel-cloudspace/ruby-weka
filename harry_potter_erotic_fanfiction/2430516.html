 come in harry dumbledore voice came from the other side of the door harry pushed the door open and stepped inside dumbledore office three pairs of eyes met harry gaze as the door swung shut behind him the familiar blue twinkling eyes of professor dumbledore shone at harry over half moon spectacles the dark eyes of alexander brooks peered at harry curiously the third set of eyes belonged to a woman harry had never met before she was tall and thin and her face was lined with many years worth of wrinkles her hair was a silver grey with a jet black streak over the left side of her forehead it was pulled into a tight bun producing the same severe effect of professor mcgonagall however her eyes seemed strangely familiar they were wide and tilted upwards at the sides she stood staring at harry her eyes seeming to look right through him he felt a chill go down his spine have a seat harry dumbledore said motioning his hand toward the chair in front of his desk harry walked over stiffly and sat down feeling three sets of eyes following him this cantbe good harry thought to himself welcome back harry dumbledore said formally i trust you had a pleasant train ride harry nodded excellent dumbledore replied i expect you d like to know why i ve asked you to come here harry glanced at mr brooks and the woman who were still staring at harry intently harry stomach tightened and he felt a slight sweat breaking through his skin harry cleared his throat yes professor dumbledore smiled i understand you have already met mr alexander brooks as he told you he will be coordinating the security task force here at hogwarts harry nodded this was not new information dumbledore held his hand toward the woman now harry i would like to introduce you to professor medusa pandoran she is hogwarts new defense against the dark arts teacher dumbledore smiled at the new professor medusa this is harry potter professor pandoran glided over to harry and held her hand out to him pleased to meet you mr potter her voice betrayed her looks harry had expected a wispy or raspy voice from this thin older woman but instead she spoke strongly and smoothly harry nodded as he stood and shook her ice cold hand her eyes bore into him making him feel uneasy harry returned to his seat and looked at dumbledore dumbledore nodded to the two seats to harry right and professor pandoran and mr brooks moved to them and settled in dumbledore sat in his chair behind his desk and looked at harry both professor pandoran and mr brooks have made special requests to meet with you harry harry looked from professor pandoran to mr brooks wondering what on earth they wanted to meet with him for he looked back to dumbledore questioningly mr brooks would you like to begin dumbledore asked gladly mr brooks replied inclining his head toward dumbledore he then turned to harry as coordinator of security my job is to research and implement the security needs of hogwarts while hogwarts is known as one of the safest and most secure places in the wizarding world there is always room for improvement therefore as coordinator there are certain things i need to know in order to ensure the safety of students for example i have spent the last month examining the weaknesses of hogwarts grounds and buildings as a result we were able to cast additional protective spells where i found weaknesses furthermore i have positioned my officials in areas where i feel they are best positioned to oversee student activity harry nodded still confused as to what mr brooks wanted of him in addition to knowing hogwarts inside and out i need to know the enemy without knowing the enemy we have no chance of implementing preventative security measures and that where you come in harry harry heart pounded hard in his chest what does that mean harry glanced at dumbledore and saw him peering at mr brooks over his steepled fingers dumbledore moved his gaze to harry and gave him a reassuring nod harry returned his gaze to mr brooks i have worked with the ministry for years harry i was there the first time we fought voldemort and have been studying him ever since harry looked at mr brooks intently the fact that mr brooks had used voldemort name made harry instantly respect him mr brooks studied harry and then continued in these past few years i have felt as though the ministry was missing an obvious piece of the puzzle as far as voldemort is concerned i could see a resource that they have refused to acknowledge i believe it could be the most valuable source of information in understanding voldemort my assignment here at hogwarts has given me the opportunity to examine this resource if you are willing harry harry stared at mr brooks blankly mr brooks smiled you are the resource harry you have come face to face with voldemort more often than many of his followers harry swallowed his brain racing what do you want me to do initially i just want to talk to you harry i want you to tell me about your experiences i know it will be difficult for you to recount some of those experiences however i believe that your unique bond with voldemort will give me an insight into understanding the enemy that my years with the ministry could not harry looked at dumbledore dumbledore leaned forward in his chair the decision is up to you harry harry looked at mr brooks skeptically so you just want me to tell you what i know about voldemort i dontthink i know more than anyone else mr brooks smiled well i would like the opportunity to find out a new perspective always helps i have promised professor dumbledore that i will not take up too much of your time you will be busy enough with your classes quidditch and your work with professor pandoran harry eyes shot to professor pandoran then returned to mr brooks who had continued talking if you agree i would like to meet with you a few times this week after that i would like to meet occasionally as the need arises harry doubted that he would really be of any help to mr brooks but there didntseem to be any harm in meeting with him there was something else that confused him though harry looked at mr brooks and said i can meet with you this week sir but you said something about my working with professor pandoran mr brooks nodded and turned to professor pandoran i ll let medusa explain professor pandoran had been sitting silently in her chair as mr brooks explained his proposition to harry she studied harry intently before she spoke mr potter i understand that last year you led a secret student society in which you studied defense against the dark arts professor pandoran said quietly harry looked at professor dumbledore nervously knowing that the ministry considered these secret meetings of the students last year worthy of expulsion dumbledore eyes twinkled brightly and a smile tugged at his lips harry encouraged by dumbledore expression turned to professor pandoran yes professor that correct she nodded curtly and continued i also understand that you are the top student in defense against the dark arts classes harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat i sorry i dontknow about that professor professor dumbledore cleared his throat i assure you harry it true harry raised his eyebrows and felt his cheeks flush there are two things i would like you to help me with mr potter both having to deal with the new battle training course i will be teaching professor pandoran began first i would like to meet with you and discuss what you covered during your meetings i would like to know which students attended and the progress they made harry looked worriedly to dumbledore the students had all sworn to keep the members of the da a secret dumbledore saw the panic in harry eyes no need to worry harry the students will not be reprimanded in any way harry released the breath he was holding he turned to professor pandoran all right professor i can do that she nodded her head the next request will take up quite a bit of your time i ask you to take some time to consider it harry swallowed and nodded his head i would like you to assist me in training students your experience and your initiative have shown you to be a responsible and knowledgeable student if you accept i would require your time three nights a week one evening would be one on one with me for your own training as well as planning for the course on the other two evenings you would be assisting me in my instruction of the battle training courses for fifth and sixth year students harry mouth hung open he was sure he must have misheard his new professor she couldntpossibly want him as an assistant he was just a sixth year student a student who more often than not was getting himself and his friends into trouble she must be mistaken how could he possibly help her harry stared at the floor his mind reeling he shook his head and looked up at professor pandoran are you sure you want me you must be thinking of someone else professor pandoran smiled a startling change from the severe cold stare she had been giving him thus far you come highly recommended harry your professors have many good things to say about you she turned her gaze to dumbledore you were right albus he is painfully modest harry stared at professor pandoran she was serious harry worked through the thoughts spinning around in his mind his professors had recommended him she obviously didnttalk to snape harry thought darkly nevertheless she had asked him was this something he could do was this something he wanted to do it was true harry had enjoyed playing the teacher role during the meetings of the da he found such satisfaction in watching the progress of his fellow students this would give him the opportunity to continue working with them helping them to gain the skills they may need in the dark times they were facing but three nights a week was quite a commitment he would also have quidditch practice not to mention mounds of homework he could just imagine the scandalized look on hermione face if he were to fall behind in his classes harry looked at dumbledore who was peering at harry solemnly dumbledore expression took harry back to the last time he was in dumbledore office harry felt his stomach clench as he remembered their conversation they had discussed sirius death and dumbledore had told harry of the prophecy harry closed his eyes as the memory overwhelmed him either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the words repeated themselves in harry mind if he were the only one who could defeat voldemort he would need to be prepared he would have to learn as much as he could and if something were to happen to him he would make sure the people he cared about would be able to defend themselves he would help them now while he could he opened his eyes and looked at professor pandoran i ll do it she stared at harry her eyes once again probing into him he felt an odd twinge in his forehead but pushed it away harry returned her stare and jumped slightly when she flinched she turned to dumbledore and said quietly you didnttell me he had mastered occlumency harry eyes widened and his mouth dropped open he looked at dumbledore who was obviously trying to hide his smile dumbledore cleared his throat and looked at professor pandoran seriously that to stay within the walls of this office medusa we have nothing to gain and much to lose if we advertise his ability harry was shocked you just tried to break into my mind he blurted professor pandoran turned her penetrating eyes to harry yes i wanted to make sure you were certain about your decision obviously i will have to take your word on it harry looked to professor dumbledore shocked not only that he had successfully blocked an intruder from his mind but also that he had done so without crashing to his knees in pain dumbledore winked at harry harry smiled well harry it seems you have a very busy year in front of you dumbledore said i ask you to come to me immediately if you are feeling overwhelmed other arrangements can be made if you feel it is too much responsibility harry nodded thanks professor i ll keep that in mind well then medusa alexander i ll leave it to you to coordinate your meetings with harry i ask you to speak with professor mcgonagall regarding gryffindor quidditch practice i dontwant minerva scolding me for gryffindor seeker missing practices dumbledore said his eyes twinkling mr brooks and professor pandoran nodded very well there a hall full of young and i sure hungry students downstairs we shall not keep them waiting any longer dumbledore rose from his chair and led the group out of his office harry followed behind feeling somewhat dumbfounded this was definitely going to be an interesting year chapter 12 a day of firsts harry are you sure you re not taking on too much hermione asked harry rolled his eyes and sighed it was monday morning and he was sitting in the great hall across from ron and hermione he had waited until their return to the gryffindor common room the night before to tell them about his meeting with dumbledore professor pandoran and mr brooks harry had been thankful that dumbledore had not mentioned anything during the welcoming feast harry was still trying to get used to the idea and was grateful that he would have some time before the entire school knew what he was going to be doing after seeing how ron and hermione reacted harry wasntsure he could handle anyone else at the moment while hermione had been hounding harry about time for homework and the importance of his grades for auror training ron had been awkwardly silent since harry told him the news harry had expected hermione reaction but ron behaviour confused him harry had hoped ron would be supportive but was left disappointed hermione how many times do i have to tell you it going to be fine harry said annoyed hermione frowned i just worried about you harry you dontalways have to be the one to take on this kind of responsibility harry glared at her you were the one who talked me into teaching defense against the dark arts classes last year how is this any different hermione stared at her hands in her lap she looked up at harry pleadingly harry this is a much larger commitment three nights a week i worried that you re going to wear yourself down harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair frustrated like i told you already dumbledore said if i ever feel overwhelmed that other arrangements can be made but harry i know you you never give up on something once you ve started it especially something like this harry stared hard at hermione they had been through this over and over again they were getting nowhere he sighed again okay hermione let make a deal i promise to go to dumbledore if things get too hard and you promise not to question my decision to do this anymore hermione reached her hand across the table and placed it on top of harry s you know it only because i care about you harry harry nodded and put his other hand on top of hers i know hermione now do we have a deal hermione smiled and nodded yes harry returned her smile and then looked at ron ron was staring at harry and hermione hands still on top of one another on the table he had a strange expression on his face ron shot harry a glance then returned to his bowl of porridge in front of him harry pulled his hands away from hermione and opened his mouth to say something to ron but was interrupted morning ginny said brightly sitting down beside harry with dean in tow harry felt the now becoming familiar flip in his stomach he forced himself to smile at ginny and dean morning harry managed from his suddenly dry mouth hi harry hermione ron dean said sitting beside ginny aware of the glare ron was sending his way ginny face reddened as she narrowed her eyes at ron hermione cleared her throat sensing a weasley shouting match in the making oh look here comes professor mcgonagall with our timetables all five heads turned to see professor mcgonagall making her way down the gryffindor table harry waited anxiously curious to see his sixth year schedule professor mcgonagall reached their group and handed the students their timetables mr potter mr weasley i believe you have transfiguration right before your lunch break can you please stay for a few minutes after class i need to speak with both of you professor mcgonagall said peering down at them over her glasses ron and harry eyed each other ron raised his eyebrows at harry who shrugged his shoulders yes professor they answered simultaneously professor mcgonagall nodded and then moved away from them what that about ginny asked no idea ron replied staring into his porridge maybe it has something to do with your meeting with dumbledore harry you never told me what happened ginny said reaching for a piece of toast after the feast last night ginny and dean had disappeared and did not return to the common room until well after harry had relayed everything to ron and hermione harry glanced at her and then to dean i ll tell you later ginny looked at harry worriedly is everything okay harry smiled at her of course it just a long story and i dontwant to get into it right now ginny looked at him confused but then turned back to her breakfast harry took a swallow of pumpkin juice and noticed hermione staring at him questioningly harry grabbed his class schedule and studied it wishing for the kind of peaceful breakfast he had come used to at grimmauld place harry schedule was slightly different this year than it had been during his first five years newt level classes were far more intense and therefore sixth and seventh year students need not take as many classes harry had decided on transfiguration charms potions defense against the dark arts herbology and care of magical creatures ron and hermione were taking the same courses except that hermione was also taking arithmancy and ancient runes harry noted that with fewer courses he had study hall times added to his schedule well that will help with the loss of a few evenings a week hermione will be happy harry told himself harry was about to point this out to hermione when the sound of hundreds of wings beating filled the great hall everyone looked up to see owls of every size and colour soar into the hall carrying letters and parcels for the students harry was surprised to see hedwig among the crowd of owls she landed in front of harry and dropped two letters in front of him she nipped a piece of toast from his plate and then flew away harry picked up the letters and examined them he did not recognize the writing on either piece of parchment he opened the top letter mr potter please meet me in my office this evening at 7 00pm please come with the list of students as discussed yesterday we will also discuss class content and scheduling sincerely professor pandoran harry glanced up at the head table where the professors sat he saw professor pandoran in conversation with professor mcgonagall he turned to the second letter harry please meet me in my office fourth floor across from the portrait of nigel the nitwit tomorrow evening 7 30 thank you alexander brooks harry folded both pieces of parchment and shoved them in his book bag he was already feeling overwhelmed and the day hadnteven started he looked up to find ron hermione and ginny all staring at him expectantly he ignored them and glanced at his class schedule again looks like we have herbology first thing then defense against the dark arts and transfiguration that shouldntbe too bad hermione surveyed harry contemplating what she was going to say she glanced from ron to ginny and then returned her gaze to harry yes but you obviously haventlooked at the afternoon yet harry looked down at his schedule thankful not to have to answer questions about his letters he didntwant hermione to go after him again and he would have to explain everything to ginny and dean he looked at his afternoon schedule charms followed by double potions harry groaned come on hermione said standing we should head out to the greenhouses dean are you taking herbology this year dean jumped startled to be included in the conversation uh yeah great do you want to walk down with us hermione asked dean shrugged sure see you later ginny dean stood up picked his bag up off the floor and kissed ginny on the top of her head as he straightened he found harry and ron staring at him frowning hermione looked from ron to harry rolled her eyes and said let go dean just ignore those two ron and harry watched hermione lead dean out of the great hall they looked at each other and then silently picked up their bags see you ginny harry said walking away wait ginny said catching harry arm harry stopped and looked at her ginny gave harry a confused look i want to know what happened in dumbledore office can we meet later and talk harry stared into her deep brown eyes thinking that he would do anything for her he thought about his day and then answered i ve got to meet with mcgonagall at lunch so how about after school we can meet in the common room after our last class ginny face brightened i have a better idea let meet on the quidditch pitch i can try out my new broom like ron ginny had received a new broom from her parents as a gift for becoming prefect harry grinned perfect i ll meet you out there harry turned and met up with ron in the entrance hall what did she want ron asked as he and harry walked outside into the crisp morning air she wants me to tell her about my meeting with dumbledore oh ron replied avoiding harry eyes harry stopped and looked at ron are you okay with me doing this ron ron stopped and turned to harry he stared down at his shoes and kicked the ground with his toe yeah he said he then looked up at harry it just weird it another thing that singles you out i guess i was surprised that you would want that harry studied ron i guess i never thought about it that way i just saw it as an opportunity to help us prepare for whatever is coming our way ron nodded what about malfoy harry knitted his eyebrows together in confusion malfoy ron nodded again malfoy you ll be teaching him at least with the da it was people we trusted now you ll be teaching a possible future death eater how to fight us harry swallowed feeling stung by ron words there nothing i can do about that ron you could have said no ron said quietly harry stared at ron but i said yes if it wasntme someone else would be training him ron at least we ll know what he learning ron nodded and stared across the sprawling grounds before them he cleared his throat and said quietly hermione pretty worried about you harry chuckled when isntshe ron returned his gaze to harry yeah right harry frowned at ron what else is going on here ron shook his head i dontknow what you re talking about harry felt his anger rising ron if i ve done something to piss you off you have to tell me ron shifted on his feet no i just being stupid never mind harry felt something click in his head he stared at his best friend is this about hermione harry watched ron face flush what harry grinned well mate are you finally going to admit it ron looked at harry with his eyebrows furrowed admit what harry rolled his eyes and laughed okay so you re not quite there yet i ll just say this hermione and i are best friends but that it there will never be anything between us beyond friendship ron face was now a deep red he cleared his throat uncomfortably right harry smiled and patted ron on the back let go before professor sprout gives us detention for being late ron nodded and stumbled along beside harry they ran into the greenhouse just before professor sprout began to call the class to order you re cutting it close boys hopefully this isntan indication of how the year is going to be professor sprout admonished raising her eyebrows no professor sorry professor harry said taking a place between hermione and neville hermione gave them a scathing look where have you been she hissed as professor sprout began reviewing several plants they had studied last year er we got sidetracked ron mumbled from hermione other side hermione opened her mouth to continue her reprimand but harry nudged her she turned to look at him and he shook his head she closed her mouth and looked at harry questioningly just leave it harry whispered hermione sighed and turned her attention to professor sprout the remainder of class went by rather quickly professor sprout took a considerable amount of time impressing upon the students the importance of their sixth year classes if they thought last year lectures on owls was bad this was much worse the students left the greenhouse feeling somewhat downtrodden and depressed i wasntexpecting lectures on newts until next year lavender moaned as the gryffindor group of sixth years walked to their defense against the dark arts class together i not surprised at all in fact i thought professor sprout took the matter a little too lightly hermione said everyone rolled their eyes i wonder what professor pandoran will be like neville said changing the topic i think she ll be all right harry said how can you tell we just saw her last night at supper lavender said oh harry said awkwardly well i already met her i had to go to dumbledore office and she was there not in trouble already were you harry lavender teased harry shook his head nope not this time lavender grinned and then turned and whispered something into parvati ear parvati looked at harry blushing harry cocked his eyebrows those two are so strange they walked into the classroom and found professor pandoran already seated at her desk she glanced up at them and nodded at harry good morning mr potter morning professor harry said taking a seat did you receive my letter this morning harry felt the eyes of everyone in the classroom turn to him yes professor does that time work for you harry nodded yes professor pandoran nodded and then glanced around the classroom observing the students the students sensing her gaze turned their eyes from harry and faced their new professor professor pandoran stood and addressed the students good morning everyone welcome to another year of defense against the dark arts she paused and then allowed a small smirk to cross her face i hope you will find this course to be an improvement over last year here here seamus cheered professor pandoran nodded at seamus to begin i will tell you a bit about myself i grew up not far from here i attended hogwarts many many years ago a few years after i completed my schooling i left europe and did not return until two weeks ago i studied the dark arts abroad and worked with several ministries in developing their defenses while i have been away for some time i understand the threat that now faces us and i hope to help you all to overcome it the students stared silently at their teacher so far she was a huge improvement over umbridge as far as how this class will be run we will be studying both the theoretical and practical aspects of magical defense i believe everyone here is enrolled in battle training is that correct everyone nodded good you will then have a great opportunity to practice your skills my assistant and i look forward to working with you harry felt his face go red as professor pandoran glanced at him luckily only ron and hermione noticed now then let begin with a little review after defense against the dark arts class transfiguration class came and went much as harry had expected they received a fierce scolding from professor mcgonagall about their dedication and responsibilities to their studies harry had to endure continual sniffing and pokes from hermione as professor mcgonagall lectured them he finally threw hermione a withering glare causing her to lay off they then began review from the previous year filling several pieces of parchment with notes with their hands aching they sighed with relief when professor mcgonagall dismissed them ron and harry walked apprehensively to the front of the class as the rest of the students filtered out for lunch you wanted to see us professor harry said as they reached professor mcgonagall desk she peered up at them over her glasses and set down her quill yes thank you for staying she stood up and walked around her desk and stood beside them her arms crossed harry and ron both swallowed hard and shifted awkwardly on their feet professor mcgonagall continued i believe we need to make some decisions regarding the gryffindor quidditch team harry and ron both felt a wave of relief quidditch they should have known professor mcgonagall looked at harry mr potter with your busy schedule this year i think it would be best to establish set times each week for quidditch practice every team will be struggling to get their practices in especially with battle training taking up three nights a week the heads of houses have agreed to meet and devise the schedule with the input of the team captains harry nodded ron cleared his throat excuse me professor with angelina gone this year who will our quidditch captain be professor mcgonagall surveyed ron thoughtfully well mr weasley you of course ron mouth dropped open and harry grinned me ron squeeked professor mcgonagall lips stretched into a thin smile yes mr weasley you are you up for it ron opened and closed his mouth several times his eyes bulging out of his head yes professor professor mcgonagall narrowed her eyes i certainly hope so mr weasley i want the quidditch cup to stay where it belongs ron grinned mr weasley i will be contacting you to let you know when we will be meeting to set the practice schedule mr potter if you would please inform your quidditch captain of the days in which you will be working with professor pandoran then we can work from there yes professor harry and ron replied professor mcgonagall nodded at them smiled slightly and left the classroom as soon as they were in the hallway ron let out a loud whoop can you believe it harry it brilliant ron brilliant ron practically skipped all the way to the great hall with harry laughing behind him all the way hermione guess what ron exclaimed as he bounded up to her at the gryffindor table she raised her eyebrows at ron and then smiled at his glowing face what mcgonagall named me quidditch captain hermione mouth dropped open she stood up and threw her arms around ron oh ron i so happy for you you must be thrilled ron wrapped his arms around hermione waist lifted her off her feet and swung her around in several circles before placing her back down ron she scolded blushing furiously ron grinned sheepishly and sat down at the table harry grinned realizing he had never seen his friend look happier harry entered the potions classroom with a feeling of dread he had just gone through an uneventful charms class and knew that he could not expect the same in potions harry sat in a desk behind ron and hermione and glanced around the room he spotted draco near the front of the classroom and sighed another year of potions with slytherins can i sit with you harry harry turned his head and saw parvati standing beside him harry removed his book bag from the empty seat sure parvati smiled shyly and sat down harry glanced behind her isntlavender taking potions parvati nodded yeah harry furrowed his eyebrows together he didntremember a time when lavender and parvati sat separately in any of their classes did you two have a fight or something harry asked parvati smiled no lavender had something she needed to take care of before she came here harry studied parvati that still didntexplain why parvati hadntsat in an empty desk and waited for lavender lavender came rushing into the classroom and beamed at parvati when she spotted her lavender whispered something in parvati ear and then sat in the empty seat behind harry and parvati dean came in shortly after and took the seat beside lavender harry turned around to find hermione and ron looking at him quizzically harry shrugged his shoulders the classroom door slammed shut and the students fell silent professor snape strode to the front of the classroom and sneered down at the students his gaze fell on harry and his eyes narrowed harry glared at his professor hating him with every ounce of his being snape expression reflected the same sentiment snape broke his stare from harry and glanced around the classroom as you can see many of your fellow classmates were unable to achieve a high enough standard in potions to continue in their sixth year of study snape said smirking and nodding his head toward the empty desks harry noticed the absence of neville and seamus from the gryffindor group apparently the standards werenthigh enough snape sneered letting his eyes fall on harry once more draco turned in his seat and smirked at harry harry clenched his fists on his desk imagining different ways to hex snape he jumped slightly when he felt parvati hand on his arm he looked at her and she smiled at him ignore him she whispered harry nodded feeling slightly awkward by parvati behaviour he returned his attention to snape since you are supposedly among the best students in sixth year i think i shall test your skills today snape said his eyes flashing dangerously snape flicked his wand causing a vial of black liquid to appear in front of each student drink snape ordered the students looked at their vials apprehensively even draco seemed to be questioning his favourite professor motives harry reached for his vial uncorked it and swallowed the liquid in one gulp he felt the liquid burn its way down his throat and into his stomach he gasped sure that his stomach was on fire harry heard groans and whimpers from all sides of the classroom as the students followed snape orders snape smirked at the students in front of him now that you ve all been poisoned i suggest you copy down the antidote he said and with a wave of his wand the potion for the antidote appeared on the blackboard the students stared at snape with a mixture of confusion and fear snape sneered at his students if you are successful your potion will reverse all effects of the poison if not madame pomfrey will be the only person you ll be seeing for the next week the students stared at snape in shock draco laughed good one professor snape eyes flashed dangerously as he turned to face draco i assure you mr malfoy i am not joking now get to work draco face paled professor snape had never spoke to draco in that manner before he had also never poisoned his students before harry grimaced as he felt another burst of fire in his stomach he took out a piece of parchment and a quill and very carefully wrote down the potion from the board he could see parvati hand shaking violently as she copied the potion down he looked at her and saw absolute fear in her face a flare of anger rose in harry only snape would do this to his students harry collected the ingredients for the potion and returned to his desk he glanced at ron and hermione but knew better than to speak to them snape would look for any opportunity to reprimand harry and prevent him from finishing his potion harry set to work lighting the fire under his cauldron and triple checking each step as we worked through the difficult potion as awful as he found potions class usually the fire burning in his stomach did not help matters harry sat on his stool and watched his potion bubble he was waiting for the green smoke to turn blue which would indicate when he needed to add the eye of newt harry scanned the classroom seeing several students hovering over their cauldrons others gripping their stomach and waiting as harry was ron caught harry eye ron raised his eyebrows and nodded at harry cauldron silently asking harry how his potion was coming harry shrugged and nodded towards ron cauldron ron grinned and nodded his head towards hermione harry smiled knowing hermione would have helped ron get it right harry turned his gaze to parvati she was standing over her cauldron with the eye of newt in her hand harry jumped off his stool and grabbed her hand not yet he whispered frantically pulling her away from the cauldron parvati stared at harry taken aback she glanced down at her notes and her eyes opened wide she swallowed hard thanks she whispered looking at harry they sat on their stools and harry noticed parvati twisting her hands in her lap he shot snape another angry glance how were they supposed to concentrate on their potion knowing that they had poison inside them snape had been walking around the classroom smirking and clicking his tongue he rather seemed to be enjoying the sickly look of the students a bright light emitted from harry cauldron and the smoke changed from green to blue harry threw in the eye of newt stirred the potion three times counter clockwise and distinguished the fire underneath he ladled the potion into a flask and set it on his desk to cool hermione eyed harry flask and then smiled at harry he breathed a sigh of relief all of the gryffindor students had managed to brew their potions correctly much to the disappointment of snape pansy parkinson on the other hand had vomited spectacularly all over draco after drinking her potion it took harry all of his willpower not to cheer loudly professor snape glared down at pansy miss parkinson how dare you disgrace the house of slytherin mr malfoy give her some of your potion before she disgraces us further harry wondered if pansy had been a gryffindor student whether or not snape would have allowed her to drink another student antidote not likely however the look on draco face as he looked down at his vomit covered robes was enough for harry to let the thought slip his mind after snape had dismissed the students harry cleaned out his cauldron and packed his school bag he paused and waited for ron and hermione to join him he felt a tap on his shoulder harry turned around and saw parvati smiling at him i wanted to thank you again for helping me with my potion harry smiled no problem parvati stared at harry her eyes shining brightly she suddenly rushed forward planted a kiss on his lips and then turned and ran out of the classroom harry stood frozen his mouth slightly ajar he stared at the doorway where parvati had just disappeared what was that ron asked his voice filled with laughter harry shook his head no idea he said his voice barely audible hermione sighed harry it obvious that she likes you haventyou noticed how she always whispering to lavender when you re around harry turned his gaze to hermione that means she likes me well it means either she or lavender likes you now i think we know which one it is hermione said leading the boys out of the classroom harry shook his head girls are so strange hermione sighed not nearly as strange as boys harry glanced at ron and grinned ron gave harry a warning look causing harry to laugh out loud what so funny hermione asked stopping and staring at harry nothing i ve just got something caught in my throat harry lied trying to hold his laughter in and coughing hermione rolled her eyes and continued walking up the stairs honestly she muttered under her breath harry glanced at ron still coughing into his hand ron blushed and punched harry in the arm once inside the common room harry raced upstairs deposited his books on his bed and grabbed his firebolt he could not wait to meet ginny and spend some time flying when he arrived at the quidditch pitch ginny was already there soaring through the air she landed beside him her eyes face flushed with excitement come on harry what are you waiting for ginny exclaimed as she kicked off from the ground again harry grinned and jumped on his firebolt he kicked the ground and immediately felt exhilarated flying was absolutely the best feeling harry had ever experienced the wind whipped through his hair as he and ginny chased each other around the pitch after nearly half an hour they glided to the ground both grinning madly ginny plopped herself on the ground there nothing better than flying she said her eyes sparkling harry sat down beside her leaning back on his arms i ve missed that ginny smiled at him gryffindor is lucky to have their seeker back you still trying out for chaser harry asked ginny nodded definitely isntit great about ron ginny knitted her eyebrows together what about ron harry grinned haventyou heard he been made quidditch captain ginny mouth dropped open wow he must be thrilled she paused and stared out over the pitch i hope he not too hard on me harry shook his head nah i think he ll be great ginny smiled ruefully well you re not his little sister harry smiled and shook his head that i not ginny returned her gaze to harry she stared into his eyes searchingly harry tore his eyes away from her gaze and began picking at the grass so are you going to tell me why dumbledore wanted to see you ginny asked quietly harry looked at ginny she was looking at him with a frown on her face actually it was mr brooks and professor pandoran that wanted to see me dumbledore just organized it what did they want harry explained the requests that both mr brooks and professor pandoran had of him and what did you say ginny asked her eyes wide i said yes to both of them harry said anxious to see her reaction ginny stared at the ground silently harry watched her trying to read the look on her face would she lecture him like hermione or be disappointed like ron i think you ll be great harry ginny said quietly still staring at the ground really harry asked surprised ginny looked up at him and smiled you re so good at defense against the dark arts and you ve had experience fighting i imagine you wish you hadntfaced death eaters as often as you have but i can see why professor pandoran would want you to help her you re an excellent student and you take your responsibilities seriously i really happy for you harry you should feel proud that you were asked harry stared at ginny he was amazed at her ability to say exactly what he needed to hear thank you ginny he said softly she smiled and punched him lightly in the arm so when do we start mr potter or should i call you professor harry rolled his eyes yeah right can you imagine malfoy calling me professor ginny laughed as she stood up and brushed the grass off her robes come on let get a few more rounds in before supper she said jumping on her broom once more harry grinned grabbed his firebolt and kicked off the ground he raced in pursuit of ginny he wasntgoing to let her get away a n fyi if you didntalready know the magical creature studied by the students in this chapter belongs to jkr i found it in fantastic beasts where to find them i can not and will not take credit for their creation as they and these wonderful characters all belong to the fabulous jo rowling thank you jo for creating such a wonderful world and allowing us to play in it chapter 13 discoveries wake up harry harry groaned and crammed his pillow over his head ron pulled the hangings around harry bed open and yanked the pillow from harry come on you said you wanted to get to class early to talk to hagrid ron whispered not wanting to disturb the other boys in the dormitory harry sighed he ron and hermione had discussed getting up early to visit hagrid they hadnttalked to him since they returned to school harry knew hagrid would be disappointed if they didntvisit him he rolled out of bed and stumbled to his dresser after harry had met with ginny on the quidditch pitch the previous day he had met up with ron and hermione in the common room there they helped him with the list of students that attended the da meetings harry also jotted down the different spells he had taught them by the time he was done with the list he only had a few minutes to shovel down some food before meeting professor pandoran their meeting had lasted nearly two hours professor pandoran went through the list of students with harry adding additional notes as to how well harry felt each student had mastered the various spells professor pandoran had then asked harry to demonstrate each of the tasks himself and quizzed him on several theoretical aspects of defensive magic she had also questioned him as to why there had been no slytherins in the group harry had squirmed uncomfortably but decided to answer truthfully since the group had to be kept secret they wanted to make sure that the students involved were trustworthy and frankly harry did not know any slytherins he felt he could trust harry had left professor pandoran office feeling more exhausted than he had after his occlumency sessions with dumbledore he returned to the common room to find ron and hermione working on their charms homework harry had joined them finishing his homework shortly before midnight harry pulled on his school robes yawning widely he followed ron down the stairs to the common room hermione was already there waiting for them it about time hermione teased she walked over to the portrait hole and led the way to the great hall they ate their breakfast quickly and then headed out to hagrid hut the sky was a clear crystal blue and the grass sparkled as the bright sunshine glistened on the dew they walked swiftly over the damp grass down the slope to hagrid hut ron pounded on hagrid door as hermione shivered in the cool morning air the door swung open and hagrid appeared his black hair a tangled mess and a huge grin spreading across his face well i was wonderin when i d see yeh three hagrid said stepping aside come in we ll have sum tea before class harry ron and hermione stepped into the warmth of hagrid hut a huge fire was crackling and sending a warm glow across the room they sat down at the table did you have a good summer hagrid hermione asked can complain can complain hagrid said setting large saucer sized mugs of tea in front of them ol dumbledore kep me busy wi this and that hagrid sat down and leaned his elbows on the table nearly upsetting all of their mugs an you hermione d ya have a good summer hermione sipped her tea and smiled yes i spent most of it with harry and ron it was great hagrid eyes moved to harry he cleared his throat how have yeh bin makin out harry harry smiled as hagrid looked at him worriedly i ve been all right i had a few rough spots over the summer but these two and ginny helped me along hagrid nodded sadly and patted ron on the shoulder causing ron to topple out of his chair hagrid did not notice however and continued talking as ron clambered back into his seat i thought bout you over the summer harry was a bloody shame what happened to sirius bloody shame harry nodded and patted hagrid humongous arm yes we all miss him hagrid sniffed loudly harry mind scrambled to find something else to talk about how has grawp been hagrid smiled widely he comin along he much more agreeable now harry ron and hermione all exchanged glances hagrid had brought his half brother a giant to the forbidden forest last year grawp had been anything but agreeable when harry and hermione had met him well look at the time hagrid said yeh d better be headin out i ll meet yeh out there in a few minutes fer class ron hermione and harry drained their mugs of tea and returned to the crisp morning air none of the other students had arrived yet i wonder what he has planned for us today ron said glancing around apprehensively hagrid idea of interestin creatures was quite different than the students hagrid always had an affinity for creatures that most people would deem dangerous i dontsee any crates or anything hermione said harry also glanced around he turned back to his friends maybe he going to teach us how to take care of grawp harry joked while secretly hoping that hagrid would not be that crazy ron and hermione looked nervously from harry to the forbidden forest you dontthink ron began his eyes open wide dontbe silly hermione said trying to convince herself as much as the others hagrid cantshow grawp to students grawp has to be kept a secret plus it wouldntbe safe for grawp or us ron looked at hermione skeptically but the noise of students approaching caught his attention a smirk came across his face hey harry here comes parvati you better pucker up harry punched ron in the arm setting ron into a gleeful roar of laughter harry looked toward the castle and saw parvati lavender neville dean and seamus followed by a group of slytherins making their way down the hill towards hagrid hut harry hadntseen parvati since her odd behaviour at the end of potions class yesterday he watched her walking towards him and felt his stomach clench harry moved his gaze from the approaching group of students to the ground before him he had no idea how to react to parvati actions he turned to hermione what should i do he whispered hermione stared at him do you like her she whispered back harry glanced at parvati who was getting closer and closer his stomach flipped nervously it was the same way he had been reacting to ginny lately he was so confused he turned to hermione and shrugged hermione studied harry her brows knitting together harry wished he could read her thoughts she finally shrugged and said well i d say you need to figure out if you like her or not i would suggest talking to her talk to her about what harry whispered frantically as the group was nearly upon them hermione rolled her eyes anything just talk to her like you talk to me honestly harry get a hold of yourself harry glanced at ron who had been very unsuccessful in containing his laughter harry clamped his jaw tight narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows at ron and nodded his head toward hermione ron laughing ceased immediately as his face flushed scarlet harry grinned satisfied my you three must have been up bright and early lavender said as the group approached ron harry and hermione hermione smiled yes we were just down for a quick visit with hagrid before class harry heard draco scoff and mutter something to his fellow slytherins neville glanced around nervously any idea what hagrid teaching us today he asked turning to ron harry and hermione they didntget a chance to answer as hagrid burst out of his hut carrying his crossbow with fang his boarhound at his heels mornin class hagrid said grinning broadly good teh see yeh back fer another year the gryffindor students smiled at hagrid apprehensively the slytherins scowled now where hagrid seemed to be scanning the grounds leading to the forbidden forest ah there they are hagrid said happily the students followed hagrid gaze emerging from the forbidden forest were four security officials dressed in heavy black cloaks wands drawn they nodded at hagrid right le go class hagrid said leading the students toward the officials and the forbidden forest ron threw harry a panicked look harry felt his heartbeat quicken as he wondered what hagrid had in store for them as they approached the security officials hagrid turned to the class al righ wait ere fer a momen hagrid spoke quietly to the security officials then returned to the students seems ter be in order come along hagrid along with two of the security officials led the group of students into the forest harry noticed the other two security officials following the group from behind the students followed hagrid in silence harry was happy to note that hagrid seemed to be sticking to the path harry had strayed off the path enough times to know that they were less likely to meet anything too dangerous along the path hagrid stopped walking and peered down into the low lying bushes lining the path he straightened up faced the class and smiled righ then today we ll be studyin a new type o creature mos people are fraid of em bu really they re jus misunderstood the class stared at hagrid too frightened to speak hagrid looked around nervously and cleared his throat righ then who can tell me what an augurey is harry heard hermione sigh in relief as her hand shot into the air hermione hagrid called smiling an augurey also called the irish phoenix is a small vulture like bird that only flies in heavy rain it was believed that the augurey low cry foretold death however it was later found that they simply sung as the rain approached hermione replied excellent hermione ten points ter gryffindor hagrid beamed i discover d this group of nests jus th other day hagrid surveyed the students before him a righ if yeh get inter pairs there should be enough nests fer everyone to get a proper look fer the remainder of class i d like yeh ta sketch th tiny birds an their nests harry hitched his school bag up on his shoulder and turned to see if neville wanted to be his partner however he came face to face with parvati harry noticed parvati blush deeply as her eyes darted to the forest floor harry stood awkwardly in front of her for a moment then remembered hermione advice he took a deep breath do you want to be my partner parvati harry asked parvati blush deepened as she lifted her eyes to meet harry s sure harry smiled and led them away from the other groups of students and over to an empty stretch of low bushes he carefully pushed the prickly brush aside painfully aware of parvati standing behind him he scanned the bush trying to find the augureys he then spotted a tear shaped nest hidden deep in the brush look harry said turning to parvati i ve found a nest parvati leaned forward her long dark hair brushing harry arm harry noticed the floral scent of her as she leaned past him to peer into the nest she straightened herself and looked at harry with her nose wrinkled they re ugly harry laughed and leaned over the nest he saw two very sickly looking greenish black birds huddled in the nest no wonder people thought these birds forewarned death they looked so mournful harry knelt on the ground beside the bush and turned to parvati i ll hold back the branches while you sketch then we ll switch okay parvati said sitting down beside harry she pulled a piece of parchment an ink bottle and a quill out of her bag and began drawing harry observed parvati as she worked her forehead was wrinkled in concentration and occasionally she bit her bottom lip as she drew her dark brown eyes darted back and forth from the birds to her drawing she is quite pretty harry observed she looked up and found harry staring at her what she asked eyeing harry curiously nothing harry said darting his eyes away from her parvati turned back to her sketch added a few more details and then set her quill down there she said narrowing her eyes as she examined her work she held it up for harry to see what do you think harry stared at her sketch rather impressed she had drawn a sideview of the nest capturing the tear dropped shape perfectly beside that she had drawn the nest from the top view looking in she had drawn the birds flawlessly harry expected to see them fly right off her page wow parvati that excellent harry said sincerely parvati frowned are you sure they look awful harry grinned they re supposed to look awful they re ugly remember parvati smiled and set her parchment on the ground okay your turn harry pulled his quill and a piece of parchment out of his bag and began drawing he had just finished the nest when he felt parvati staring at him he looked up what he asked parvati jumped and darted her eyes away n nothing i was nothing she stammered harry set down his quill and stared at her what he asked again parvati blushed deeply then said quietly i sorry i kissed you yesterday harry felt his own cheeks flush he had not expected her to say that oh that harry croaked he cleared his throat dontworry about it he said wondering if the little time they had just spent together made her realize what an idiot he really was harry picked up his quill and continued drawing thinking about what he was going to say to hermione for putting such a stupid idea in his head harry was lost in thought when he felt parvati lean closer to him as he sat hunched over his parchment she whispered that not how i imagined our first kiss to be harry hand froze over his parchment as parvati returned to her previous position he felt his mouth go dry as he stared unseeing at his parchment he swallowed hard feeling his heart pounding in his chest she had imagined them kissing before harry cleared his throat and continued staring at his parchment how did you imagine it to be harry asked quietly he raised his eyes to hers and found her smiling at him shyly harry finding courage he didntknow he had glanced around at the other students in the class the closest pair was at least ten feet away and everyone was bent over the bushes peering into the bird nests he returned his gaze to parvati who was still staring at him her eyes sparkling harry leaned forward slightly looking into her eyes questioningly parvati leaned towards him her eyes fluttering closed harry leaned in and met her lips with his he felt her soft lips press against his sending a jolt down his spine they broke apart and smiled at each other both blushing al righ class gather yer things together time ter head back hagrid voice boomed through the forest harry looked down at his half finished sketch and frowned he d have to finish it for homework i can help you with that parvati said reading harry expression harry pushed himself to his feet and held his hand out for parvati she put her hand in his and allowed harry to pull her to her feet dontworry about it harry said stooping to pick up his school bag i ll get it done parvati smiled well you can borrow my drawing she said she then grinned and blushed after all it was my fault that you didntget done harry looked at her and grinned that true you did distract me parvati blushed deeper and smiled at harry here she said handing harry her drawing just get it back to me when you re done thanks he said smiling and placing her parchment into his bag we should get going parvati nodded and moved toward the rest of the students who were gathering around hagrid harry followed her and met up with ron and hermione parvati turned waved at harry shyly and then joined lavender harry turned to ron and hermione grinning good class eh ron and hermione stood staring at harry er right ron said eyeing harry curiously the students made their way out of the forest silently escorted by hagrid and the security officials once the students were out of the forest they all began chattering as they walked toward the castle harry noticed ron and hermione shooting curiously glances at him as they walked up to the castle no matter how hard he tried harry couldntwipe the silly grin off of his face several yards ahead of them parvati was walking with lavender harry noticed the smile on parvati face as she talked to lavender lavender suddenly squealed loudly causing several students to turn and look at her wonder what that all about ron said raising his eyebrows harry felt his face flush thinking that he had a pretty good idea hermione turned to look at harry why is your face all red harry harry glanced at hermione and tried his best to look nonchalant is my face red he asked innocently ron turned to look at him harry are you blushing harry swearing at himself for still smiling shook his head why would i be blushing hermione glanced at ron and raised an eyebrow she turned back to harry i noticed you were partners with parvati in class harry shrugged yep ron and hermione stared at harry hermione prodded and how was it good harry replied smiling widely he glanced ahead and saw parvati glancing at him over her shoulder she smiled and turned back around ron stared at harry incredulously you like her dontyou harry blushed well well what ron and hermione said together harry blushed deeper i sort of kissed her you what ron and hermione shrieked stopping in their tracks harry rolled his eyes come on you guys dontmake a big deal out of this you kissed her ron whispered his eyes dancing with a mixture of glee and amazement during class hermione scolded quietly what if you got caught harry shrugged we didntget caught hermione continued to look at him with a scandalized look harry sighed it not like we were snogging it was a quick kiss no big deal hermione relented so you like her she asked harry looked up at the castle parvati was nearly at the main doors yeah i think so harry said returning his gaze to hermione hermione looked at harry her eyebrows furrowed what harry asked eyeing hermione expression hermione looked at harry as though confused i just thought she began never mind as long as you re happy i happy for you she said ron shook his head i never saw this one coming he clapped harry on the back harry grinned at ron well ron some of us dontneed years to see things coming ron mouth dropped open he glanced frantically at hermione and then stared daggers at harry blushing furiously hermione stood looking from ron to harry and back again she opened her mouth then snapped it shut she narrowed her eyes is there something i should know no ron blurted hermione studied ron and then glanced at harry well let go then she turned and continued walking toward the castle harry ducked as ron swung his school bag at him i ll get you for this ron muttered to harry following hermione into the castle just thought you could use a little nudge mate harry said grinning just a little nudge harry spent the rest of the day dodging ron angry glances avoiding hermione questions and returning parvati shy smiles parvati had sat beside harry during double transfiguration defense against the darks arts and charms harry had struggled to keep his attention on his professor lectures and not let his mind stray to the morning incident harry tossed his bag on a table in the far corner of the library it was one of his scheduled study hall times and he knew he had to take advantage of it ron slouched down in the chair beside him what are you working on harry opened his school bag i think i ll finish my augurey sketch first then i going to start mcgonagall essay ron smirked you didntfinish your sketch harry grinned no ron smiled so where is parvati she hasntleft your side all day harry pulled out his and parvati sketches from his bag and laid them on the table she taking divination ron snorted cantsay i ll miss that class neither will i harry said smiling he smoothed parvati drawing next to his and began sketching the birds he looked up at ron what are you working on ron stretched in his seat and then slouched down further i guess i ll work on mcgonagall essay i not feeling very motivated though harry grinned need hermione around do you ron glared at harry dontstart with that again harry held up his hands and smiled i not starting anything ron studied harry so are you going to ask parvati out harry looked at ron are you going to ask hermione out ron mouth dropped open and his ears burned red what makes you think i like hermione anyway harry looked at ron seriously dontyou ron stared at his books on the table he glanced at harry and then stared across the library deep in thought harry returned to his sketch not wanting to push ron any more than he already had he was thankful that parvati had leant him her sketch he finished his in no time he packed away the sketches and pulled out a blank piece of parchment and his transfiguration text he flipped through the pages to find the information on switching spells it would be suicide ron said flatly harry looked up from his books pardon ron turned his eyes to harry me asking out hermione it would be suicide harry set down his quill why do you say that ron smiled sadly playing with the tattered edge of his textbook well first of all she d say no second of all our friendship would be ruined and third i d be so mortified i d crawl into a hole to die simply put it would be suicide harry stared at ron fully appreciating for the first time how much ron cared for hermione he suddenly felt extremely guilty for teasing ron relentlessly what if she said yes harry said quietly ron snorted not likely harry stared at ron not really knowing what to say he thought he had seen indications that hermione cared just as much for ron as he did for her but harry couldntbe sure harry would never claim to understand girls even the one he was best friends with harry shrugged i guess you ll never know unless you ask ron nodded and straightened himself in his chair obviously wanting to drop the subject so what page are the switching spells on harry smiled at his friend and pushed his textbook towards him harry did not envy ron position harry did not know how he himself would handle falling in love with his best friend chapter 14 remembering voldemort harry left gryffindor tower shortly after seven o clock tuesday evening he knew he had plenty of time to find mr brooks office but seeing as he had never been there before he thought he d go a little early he followed the staircases down to the fourth floor and began scanning the portraits on the wall he wasntsure how he would know which painting was nigel the nitwit but he had learned over time that such things usually made themselves apparent so far all of the paintings were either landscapes or magical creatures harry continued down the corridor until he came to a grey haired man in a double peaked wizard hat the old man was trying to convince a very stern looking witch of something honestly evelyn i dontknow how it happened they just disappeared dontgive me that same old line nigel you know me better than that harry smiled and walked to the door on the opposite wall of the portrait and knocked the door swung open and mr brooks stood beaming at harry ah harry you re early come in and have a seat just let me clear these papers away harry walked in to mr brooks office and felt his mouth drop open the walls were plastered with pictures charts and maps harry recognized many of the pictures to be various rooms within hogwarts as well as some outside shots of the castle handwritten notes were scrawled on several of the pictures on the wall directly behind mr brooks desk there was a chart labeled with the four houses of hogwarts in each column were pictures of students grouped according to year harry followed the gryffindor column down to the sixth year grouping to find his own smiling face on the wall to harry right mr brooks had pinned a map of the hogwarts grounds again there were several handwritten scrawls spread over it harry sat down in the chair facing the desk mr brooks was busy scooping up the papers on his desk he looked up at harry and smiled i was just working on the duty schedule for the officers it always seems that everyone needs the same days off he said shaking his head harry smiled as he watched mr brooks stuff the papers into the drawer in his desk mr brooks pulled out a fresh piece of parchment and settled himself in his chair he clasped his hands together on the desk in front of him and looked at harry soberly the light hearted atmosphere of the office evaporated now harry what we are about to discuss will not leave this room i am asking you these questions for my information only i will be recording our conversation but i will put a secrecy charm on this parchment which will allow only me to read it i realize that some of the things i will be asking you will be difficult for you to answer all i ask is that you try your best and trust me before we begin do you have any questions harry shook his head mr brooks nodded and dipped his quill into the jar of ink on his desk he made a few scratches on the parchment and then looked up at harry let begin what is your earliest memory of voldemort harry swallowed he knew what his earliest memory was and it was also one of the most difficult he ran his fingers through his hair nervously he cleared his throat the day he killed my parents mr brooks stared at harry sorry did you say the day he killed your parents harry nodded mr brooks raised his eyebrows how old were you at the time harry just over one i think mr brooks nodded and furrowed his eyebrows together and you remember that harry paused well i didntremember it until a couple years ago it came back to me when a dementor came on the hogwarts express mr brooks nodded and scribbled on his parchment can you please tell me about your memory harry harry closed his eyes feeling his throat constrict he opened his eyes but focused on the floor i can hear my dad yelling for my mum to take me and hide he was going to try to hold voldemort off then i can hear my mum screaming and pleading for voldemort to kill her instead of me and i can hear voldemort telling her to get out of the way and i can hear him laughing then there a flash of green light that all i remember mr brooks stared at harry with a pained look and you heard this when you were facing a dementor harry nodded i hear it every time mr brooks swallowed and shook his head can you tell me what voldemort said to your mother exactly harry closed his eyes and told mr brooks as much as he could remember they then moved on to harry encounter with voldemort in his first year at hogwarts mr brooks asked harry to recount every minute detail from the first time he met professor quirrell in the leaky cauldron until he passed out after facing voldemort when harry had retrieved the philosopher stone harry strained to remember everything hoping that in some way his memories would help mr brooks harry had to admit recounting the memories was rather unnerving we ll stop there for tonight harry mr brooks said an hour and a half later are you able to come back tomorrow night harry nodded sure same time mr brooks nodded surveying harry he clasped his hands together in front of him and stared into harry eyes harry if my information is correct your next encounter with voldemort was connected to the chamber of secrets and an old diary is this true harry nodded yes voldemort had created a diary when he was younger i understand you know the young girl who discovered this diary harry felt a lump rise in his throat ginny yes sir i know her mr brooks studied harry do you think she would be willing to talk to me harry shrugged i could ask her if you like mr brooks nodded yes see if she can accompany you tomorrow night i believe her insight would be valuable as well harry nodded feeling sick he did not wish for ginny to have to relive her experiences of voldemort possessing her very well i ll see you tomorrow night harry good night mr brooks harry said rising from his chair harry left mr brooks office and dragged himself up the stairs toward gryffindor tower he was feeling quite shaken from his meeting with mr brooks and was dreading asking ginny to go through the same thing he was quite sure ginny would agree to meet mr brooks which only made harry feel worse he clambered through the portrait hole and into the common room he saw ron and hermione wave at him from their seats next to the fireplace harry returned their wave but did not move to join them he scanned the room if he was going to ask ginny about meeting mr brooks he wanted to get it over with he spotted her she was sitting at a table at the far end of the room bent over a piece of parchment scribbling furiously her long red hair was hanging forward hiding her face from him harry walked over to her hey ginny ginny jumped and whipped her head up to look at harry her face broke into a smile harry dontsneak up on me like that she said grinning harry smiled at her and then glanced around at the other students sitting with ginny they were all staring at harry curiously harry looked back to ginny sorry i didntmean to startle you can i talk to you for a minute harry asked nodding his head away from the table ginny eyebrows arched questioningly sure she said rising from her chair harry led her to a deserted corner of the common room harry didntknow how much if anything ginny had talked to her friends about her experience with voldemort he did know that he didntwant an audience for their talk what up ginny asked i had my first meeting with mr brooks tonight harry began ginny forehead wrinkled with concern did it go all right harry shrugged his shoulders it was okay it was a little weird thinking about all that stuff again ginny nodded i can imagine harry throat tightened he frowned at ginny i have something to ask you ginny put her hand on harry arm her eyes wide what is it harry harry looked into ginny eyes she looked so worried he sighed i supposed to meet with mr brooks again tomorrow night ginny nodded still holding on to harry arm he wanted me to ask you to come as well harry said slowly ginny eyes widened as her hand dropped from harry arm harry continued he wants to ask you about voldemort about the chamber of secrets ginny stared at the floor harry wanted to tell her to say no to tell her that she didnthave to do it but he could not find his voice he stood silently beside her she raised her eyes to harry with a determined look on her face okay at what time harry smiled sadly at her seven thirty ginny nodded and forced a smile harry grabbed her hand and squeezed it i ll meet you here we ll go down together all right ginny squeezed his hand in return okay harry harry released her hand and watched her return to the table she was sitting at when he had come in the students all leaned toward her pummeling her with questions harry watched as ginny pursed her lips and shook her head she gathered her books and walked alone up the stairs to the girls dormitory without a backwards glance harry stood by the portrait hole in the gryffindor common room wednesday evening waiting for ginny no one had seen much of her that day those that had seen her said she seemed withdrawn not at all her usual self harry glanced around wondering if ginny had changed her mind he almost hoped that she had as harry looked around the room his eyes fell on parvati she was sitting in one of the overstuffed armchairs next to lavender the two girls had their heads together as they pored over a textbook harry and parvati had sat next to each other in each of their classes again harry had discovered that talking to parvati was not nearly as difficult as he had expected and that he rather enjoyed it he didntthink that ron minded being hermione partner in each class either parvati looked up and met harry gaze she smiled as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear harry grinned at her he was considering walking over to talk to parvati when a flash of red by the girls staircase distracted harry he turned and saw ginny rushing towards him she looked tired and quite nervous are you okay harry asked as ginny approached him ginny nodded and walked out the portrait hole harry followed her feeling extrememly uneasy they walked in silence harry led them down the staircases to the fourth floor and along the corridor he turned to face ginny in front of mr brooks office door ginny face was extremely pale she had dark circles under her eyes and her forehead was creased harry placed his hand on ginny arm and looked down at her you donthave to do this ginny ginny looked up at harry her eyes shining brightly i scared i ve tried so hard to forget all of this she whispered her voice trembling harry heart broke he hated that something he agreed to do had come to involve ginny being hurt he swallowed hard and repeated you donthave to do this ginny shook her head and cleared her throat she pulled herself up straight raised her chin and looked determinedly into harry eyes yes i do she turned and knocked on the door before harry could say anything else mr brooks opened the door and smiled down at harry and ginny good evening please come in harry and ginny walked into the office as mr brooks closed the door behind them ginny eyes scanned the walls her eyes wide mr brooks walked behind his desk and held his hand to the two seats opposite him please have a seat harry and ginny moved silently to their chairs harry glanced at ginny and noticed she was clasping her hands tightly in her lap mr brooks nodded his head to ginny miss weasley i believe we met on the hogwarts express you were in the prefect compartment correct ginny nodded yes sir mr brooks pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill he set them on his desk and looked at ginny intently miss weasley i will tell you what i have already told harry the things we discuss in this room stay in this room i will record our conversation but i will place a secrecy charm on this parchment so that no one else can read it i acknowledge that the questions that i am going to ask you may be difficult to answer but i ask that you answer them to the best of your ability ginny nodded nervously first miss weasley as i do not know anything about your experiences i feel the need to ask would you prefer harry to leave the room ginny eyes shot to harry she shook her head and swallowed hard no i want him to stay i donthave anything to hide harry felt his throat tighten he reached over and grabbed ginny hand to give it a reassuring squeeze she clasped onto his hand and didntlet go mr brooks nodded okay miss weasley tell me when you first found voldemort diary ginny took a deep breath well actually it was tom riddle diary at the time the diary was created he had not yet become v voldemort harry felt ginny shudder she had never said voldemort name before mr brooks nodded ginny continued i found the diary in my cauldron the first night at hogwarts i was unpacking my books and found it mr brooks scribbled on his parchment and what did you do with it at first i thought it must have been put in there by fred or george they re my older brothers they re always playing jokes on people but they re harmless ginny explained staring at the floor i didnteven consider it might be something i couldnttrust ginny said quietly what happened next when i opened it i saw the blank pages i thought maybe it was written in invisible ink or maybe there had been a charm placed on it i decided to write my name in it you know so no one would take it mr brooks nodded his quill scratching across the paper when i wrote my name the ink disappeared then then there were someone else words on the page ginny swallowed and blinked her eyes quickly she gripped harry hand tighter it was him mr brooks nodded looking at ginny sympathetically miss weasley i need to know what you wrote in the diary and what tom riddle wrote back ginny shrugged at first it was just silly girl stuff i complained about my brothers teasing me i wrote about my worries about doing well in school ginny paused and grinned at harry i declared my undying love for harry potter harry felt his cheeks flush as he returned ginny grin mr brooks cleared his throat how did tom respond ginny returned her gaze to the floor he asked a lot of questions about harry i told him all about harry and what he had been through of course i never questioned why he asked me about harry i just thought he was being caring he was sympathetic and said everything i needed to hear i felt like the luckiest girl in the world i could tell him anything and knew he wouldntlaugh at me or judge me he was like a best friend ginny concluded quietly harry looked at ginny sadly wishing he had been that friend she needed back then and then things changed ginny said her voice trembling i started having blocks of time that i didntremember where i was or what i was doing i would black out and then come to in a completely different part of the castle than i remembered last being when i confided this to tom he reassured me that i was just imagining things he told me that i worried so much about school and fitting in that i had simply exhausted myself ginny paused staring intently at the floor she then continued her voice cracking and i believed him i was feeling so tired and i felt so alone he was the only one who really knew me i put my trust in him and believed him ginny eyes shot up angrily to mr brooks it took awhile for me to realize he was just using me mr brooks stared at ginny sadly tell me about that ginny returned her gaze to the floor i began to notice how weak i felt after writing in the diary it was like each time i wrote in it i left a part of myself behind and i couldntignore the facts anymore each time i had a blackout there had been another student attack i couldntexplain the paint all over my hands or the feathers all over my robes that when i tried to get rid of the diary i threw it in the toilet in moaning myrtles bathroom i was horrified when i discovered that harry had found it mr brooks eyebrows knitted together why is that i was scared tom would tell harry about my crush on him i would have been mortified ginny replied mr brooks turned to harry tell me about your experiences with the diary harry harry explained how it had taken him some time to discover the secrets of the diary he then explained how tom had pulled harry into the diary and showed him the memory of tom finding hagrid with aragog so in the memory he gave you no indication that he was actually the heir of slytherin mr brooks asked harry shook his head no i didntknow that until i went into the chamber what happened to the diary it was stolen from my dormitory harry said glancing at ginny i stole it ginny said quietly like i said i didntwant tom to tell harry about the things i wrote please continue miss weasley ginny took a deep shaky breath tom made quick work of me when i got the diary back it wasntlong before he took me into the chamber of secrets what do you remember ginny shuddered i really dontremember anything during the times that v voldemort possessed me ginny began wringing her hands apparently unaware that harry was still intertwined with them he winced slightly but did not pull away i mean i knew something had happened i knew i didntfeel right ginny gulped i felt violated mr brooks and harry stared at ginny in silence that last time though was different deep down i knew he wasntgoing to let me go the darkness i was in seemed to get deeper and deeper i felt my mind and my body slipping away i was helpless he had me i knew he had me and there was nothing i could do about it ginny trembling voice seemed to reverberate off the walls harry had put his head in his free hand his breath shallow and strained he had never heard ginny talk about her experience it was almost too much for him to bear ginny continued the next thing i knew i woke up in the chamber with harry beside me and tom was gone mr brooks set down his quill and studied ginny miss weasley you are one of the bravest people i have ever met not only did you survive such a terrible experience but you came here today to share it with a complete stranger i admire you ginny shook her head if it helps at all i assure you what you have told me has opened my eyes greatly i appreciate you coming tonight mr brooks turned to harry harry i d like to ask you a few more questions about your time in the chamber but i think we have done enough for tonight it would please me if you could escort miss weasley back to her room harry nodded when would you like me to come back i believe professor pandoran was hoping to meet with you tomorrow night and i would hate to bother you on a friday night how about saturday one o clock harry nodded sure mr brooks i ll see you saturday mr brooks stood and opened the door for them he held out his hand to ginny thank you again miss weasley ginny shook his hand and nodded harry and ginny stepped into the hallway in silence they had walked several feet when ginny stopped and turned to harry harry harry looked down at ginny his heart ached as he saw the tears in ginny eyes that she was fighting so hard to hold back ginny brushed a few escaped tears angrily off her face how can he still make me feel like this it okay ginny harry said brushing her hair away from her face you dontalways have to be strong harry watched ginny struggle with herself willing herself not to cry ginny looked into harry eyes and saw sympathy and understanding she let out a whimper and then rushed into harry arms harry held her close to him resting his chin on top of her head ginny cried allowing herself to feel the horror that she had held in for so long harry did not know how long they had stood there he did not really care ginny had been there for him when he so badly needed someone he knew he would stay there forever if that was what she needed eventually ginny gently pushed herself away from harry and wiped her face with her fingers sorry about that ginny said avoiding harry eyes dontbe sorry harry said softly are you going to be okay ginny lifted her puffy red eyes to meet harry gaze she nodded thanks for being there for me harry i dontthink i could have made it through without you harry gave ginny a small smile i ll always be here for you gin ginny studied harry and then grinned you are one of a kind harry potter harry smiled at ginny and then placed a hand on his chest and raised his eyebrows in an air of faked arrogance he replied frankly i dontknow how you ever managed to get over me ginny grinned at him with a mischievous glint in her eyes who said i did ginny turned and walked down the corridor leaving harry gaping after her chapter 15 the training room harry lied in his bed replaying ginny words over and over in his mind who said i did her voice echoed in his head as her brown eyes swam in front of him teasingly she couldnthave been serious harry told himself she dating dean she can play a joke as well as fred and george she was joking she had to be harry had fallen asleep with this thought in his mind when he woke the next morning he felt confident that ginny had indeed been joking and was reassured shortly thereafter upon seeing dean and ginny walk hand in hand into the great hall for breakfast harry smiled a good morning to them both and mentally acknowledged ginny for a joke well played harry was sitting at the long gryffindor table across from ron and hermione a voice startled him from his thoughts good morning mr potter harry turned around and saw professor pandoran standing behind him morning professor if you are able i would like to meet with you tonight are you free professor pandoran asked harry nodded yes mr brooks told me last night that you wanted to see me professor pandoran inclined her head excellent can you meet me at seven o clock yes professor good meet me in my office and we ll move to the training room from there professor pandoran replied harry stared at the retreating back of professor pandoran wondering what kind of work they d be doing that night hermione leaned forward her eyebrows arched there a training room harry harry shrugged i dontknow pandoran hasntreally talked to me about the actual training yet so far i as much in the dark as you harry pulled on his trainers and glanced at the clock beside his bed 6 55 p m he stuffed his wand in his pocket and ran down the stairs two at a time he waved hastily in the direction he knew ron and hermione to be and crossed the common room quickly he was a few feet away from the portrait hole when he heard someone call his name he spun around and saw parvati walking towards him harry smiled hi parvati hi she said her eyes twinkling where are you rushing off to i have to meet professor pandoran parvati forehead wrinkled as her eyebrows came together why harry shifted on his feet in all of the conversations he had had with parvati that week he had not told her of his work with their professor he didntthink now was the time either he shrugged his shoulders she asked for my help with something parvati raised an eyebrow being mysterious are you she said grinning oh well i was just going to ask you if you wanted to work together on that potions homework but i guess you re busy harry looked at parvati and saw her disappointment he frowned yeah sorry he shoved his hands in his pockets feeling extremely awkward he cleared his throat we could get together this weekend to work on it it not due until monday parvati face brightened and a smile spread across her face okay she said shyly harry grinned as he looked into her upturned face so i ll see you tomorrow in class parvati nodded tomorrow harry planted a kiss on parvati cheek then turned and went through the portrait hole leaving a very rosy cheeked parvati behind professor pandoran was waiting for harry outside of her office when harry arrived she smiled at harry follow me mr potter harry followed professor pandoran in silence she however talked non stop as they walked we ll be breaking in the training room tonight we ve been working on it for quite some time dumbledore had all of the professors contributing their time and skills even had them give up some of their summer holidays i expect a few of them may show up tonight to see their hard work in action i dontknow if i ve seen anyone as excited as professor flitwick he quite mad actually i imagine mcgonagall and snape will make an appearance as well ah yes look there they are waiting for us harry and professor pandoran arrived at the end of a long corridor on the main floor they had passed the classroom that was transformed last year to accommodate firenze a centaur who had taken over the post of divination teacher they had continued past firenze classroom to the very end of the corridor harry saw professors flitwick mcgonagall snape and dumbledore standing outside of a dark tall oak door good evening professor dumbledore said bowing his head to harry and professor pandoran as you can see we re a little anxious professor pandoran bowed her head to the four professors i was just telling mr potter that we might expect you shall we go in professor dumbledore held his hand out and stepped aside allowing professor pandoran to approach the door she took out her wand whispered a quick succession of incantations under her breath and then tapped the door lightly with her wand the door clicked open and the group of professors and harry stepped inside the door swung closed behind them with a soft click harry scanned the room and raised his eyebrows the room was rather unremarkable it was nearly empty except for a stretch of cabinets along one wall the marble floors and walls were gleaming brightly reflecting the lights from the torches on the wall harry stared at the room wondering why it took a collection of professors hours of their time to prepare as far as harry could tell a completely empty room the only remarkable thing about the room was its size it was at least five times the size of the great hall well mr potter i ll need to explain a few things to you professor pandoran said she turned to dumbledore i hope you dontmind waiting a few moments longer dumbledore eyes twinkled not at all professor pandoran smiled very well shall i make it a bit more comfortable i prefer the outdoors myself professor pandoran flicked her wand and said grounds number four harry blinked his eyes hard sure that he had to be imagining things he suddenly found himself in the hogwarts grounds near the beech tree beside the lake he felt a warm breeze on his face as he stared at the orange sun setting behind the mountains harry whipped his head around in all directions was he suddenly outside but he couldntbe the warmth of the setting sun was more indicative of a summer evening harry knew that september evenings were much cooler and the sun should be much lower on the horizon if not completely set professor flitwick startled harry from his confusion by clapping his hands excitedly professor flitwick was bouncing on his feet excellent simply marvelous perfect ah this is one of my favourites medusa professor dumbledore replied sighing he turned to snape mcgonagall and flitwick let give medusa and harry some time the shade of that beech tree is calling me professor dumbledore winked at the stunned harry and then led snape flitwick and mcgonagall toward the beech tree harry watched as dumbledore conjured four reclining lawn chairs under the tree harry turned to professor pandoran his mouth hanging open he had so many questions that he did not know where to begin pandoran smiled at harry she conjured two chairs and indicated for harry to have a seat harry moved robotically to the chair still too confused to speak welcome to the training room mr potter professor pandoran said smiling harry raised his eyebrows and cleared his throat so we are still in the castle pandoran nodded and glanced around yes i think i ll start my explanation from the very beginning harry stared at professor pandoran waiting when the idea was first put forward about a battle training course at hogwarts there were quite a few people opposed to it however the ministry was adamant their fear of what our future holds had them believing that everyone will be involved in this war as a result the ministry decided that the wizarding world must prepare its youth for the struggles they will face in the not too distant future professor dumbledore insisted that if there were to be a training course in his school it had to be realistic he wanted the students to have an authentic experience that would prepare them for real battle that is how this room came to be harry looked around thinking that this peaceful setting was the last thing that made him think of battle training harry returned his gaze to professor pandoran and realized she had been watching him she smiled at him sadly it is not very often that we know when and where an attack is going to occur it could happen anywhere any time even on a warm summer evening because of this we are going to provide the students with a multitude of experiences so they may be prepared for an attack under any conditions we ve developed a variety of settings for the training room mr potter this setting is but one among dozens harry stared at professor pandoran trying to absorb everything she was saying she surveyed harry perhaps it would be best to show you she turned and called to the four professors lounging under the beech tree may i interrupt you i d like to illustrate to mr potter the wonders of this room professor flitwick squeaked and jumped out of his chair dumbledore and mcgonagall rose and smiled at flitwick snape scowled by all means medusa professor dumbledore said his eyes sparkling professor pandoran and harry rose from their chairs professor pandoran flicked her wand causing the two chairs to disappear she then turned to harry i ll just go through several of the settings so you can get an idea of our options are you ready harry nodded still quite unsure what to expect professor pandoran flicked her wand as she said hogsmeade number one in a blink of an eye harry found himself in front of the three broomsticks in hogsmeade he stared open mouthed at the accuracy of every light post storefront window tree and crack in the sidewalk classroom one professor pandoran said flicking her wand harry was now in professor mcgonagall classroom flick professor pandoran classroom flick the great hall flick greenhouse three flick diagon alley flick the leaky cauldron flick the forbidden forest flick the empty classroom harry gaped as his surroundings were repeatedly changed it was truly unbelievable each week we ll use a different setting for training professor pandoran explained leaving the empty classroom around them we will train the students through obstacles and teach them to not only use their magical skills but to learn how to use their surroundings as protection as well students will be grouped according to year fifth years will train on tuesday evenings sixth years wednesdays and seventh years thursdays mr potter your individual training will be on mondays harry nodded the training will be two hours long the first thirty minutes will be a classroom session in which students will review and learn a variety of jinxes hexes and spells the next half hour will be physical training a battle will require more than wits and magical ability therefore a physically fit body is necessary after all the difference between failure and success may simply be outrunning the opponent the final hour will see this room put to the test students will be randomly divided into two groups at the beginning of each session the two groups will battle each other in one of these settings you mr potter will lead one of the groups and i will lead the other now obviously we canthave students being injured in this process as a result professor snape has developed a potion that will act as an invisible shield the spells will still hit the students but the shield will absorb the spell leaving the student fallen but unharmed harry swallowed and glanced at professor snape memories of harry first potions class this year made harry very hesitant to drink any more potions from snape shall we demonstrate professor snape professor pandoran asked snape nodded curtly and strode to the stretch of cabinets along the wall he reached in and grabbed a tray of flasks from the cupboard professor pandoran reached for one of the flasks and drained the cherry red liquid harry had to bite the insides of his cheeks to prevent himself from screaming for her not to drink it professor pandoran shivered slightly and then turned to face snape all right severus what are you going to hit me with professor pandoran asked harry wanted to protest not only was he uncomfortable with snape jinxing anyone but it seemed so wrong for this frail elderly professor to place herself at the mercy of snape furthermore harry could see no evidence of any kind of protective shield snape eyed professor pandoran then flicked his wand stupefy horrified harry watched professor pandoran fall to the floor he ran forward to the crumpled figure professor pandoran was lying on her side with her eyes closed professor snape stepped next to harry pointed his wand at professor pandoran and said ennervate professor pandoran eyes fluttered open she smiled as her eyes focused on harry who was still leaning over her what an unusual sensation she mused as harry helped her to her feet you re okay then harry asked looking worriedly at professor pandoran she smiled and patted harry cheek with her hand you worry too much mr potter to ease your mind why dontyou give it a try harry looked hesitantly at the tray of flasks go on harry professor dumbledore said harry eyed the group of professors around him other than snape who was sneering his professors were smiling at him encouragingly harry picked up one of the flasks and downed the liquid he felt a brief numbing sensation and then felt nothing he turned to face professor pandoran but was unexpectedly hit by a spell he felt his body go rigid harry was sure he had been hit with a body binding spell but he thought he should feel different than this harry saw rather than felt his body falling backwards his eyes frozen open watched as the wall met the ceiling and then saw nothing but ceiling he lay flat on his back unable to move or speak he felt as though he was floating in water or that he was on a pillow of clouds enveloped in a bubble that blocked out all sound he watched as his professors leaned over him with amused looks on their faces he then saw dumbledore say the counter spell harry body seemed to melt onto the ground as he regained his senses he pushed himself up and grinned that was really strange he replied sorry i hit you when you werentexpecting it harry professor dumbledore said smiling i wanted it to be realistic harry grinned and nodded well then professors shall we have a trial run professor pandoran asked harry eyebrows rose as he watched his professors nod enthusiastically very well professor pandoran said professor dumbledore i ll ask you to lead one team this evening and i ll lead the other she walked over to the cabinets and pulled out a small trunk she tapped the lid with her wand and said two the lid sprang open revealing two badges one red one green she picked up the green badge and pinned it to her robes instantly her robes transformed into a set of jet black robes with a green stripe down both sides she tossed the red badge to dumbledore who pinned it on his robe and grinned as he watched his blue robes turn black and a red stripe race down the sides professor pandoran closed the trunk all right snape flitwick mcgonagall and potter come get your badges one by one they opened the trunk and pulled out a badge the trunk split them evenly between the two colours transforming their robes and thus creating the two opposing teams dumbledore had harry and flitwick on his team while pandoran had snape and mcgonagall any requests for setting dumbledore professor pandoran asked professor dumbledore eyes twinkled how about my office pandoran smiled that gives you quite the advantage but i think we re up to the challenge she waved her wand and said headmaster one dumbledore office materialized in front of them harry noticed that professor pandoran and her team were not in the room dumbledore gathered flitwick and harry to his side all right team use whatever you need to avoid them the space is small but there are tables and chairs that can be used as barriers if they cantsee you they canthit you only take a shot when it clear to wait i think i hear them coming harry heard a noise on the other side of professor dumbledore office door the door suddenly burst open shattering into pieces harry briefly saw snape mcgonagall and pandoran before he dove behind dumbledore desk as a shower of spells fell around him harry felt panic rising inside of him the last time he was dodging spells was in the department of mysteries the memories of watching his friends being hurt rushed through his mind it was as though he were back there again the taunting laugh of bellatrix lestrange seemed to echo around him and the red slits that were voldemort eyes flashed in front of him then suddenly all he could see was sirius falling into the black veil harry could not move he could not break his mind from his memories dumbledore office was being destroyed around him but harry did not even notice as far as he knew he was in the depths of the department of mysteries seeing sirius for the last time sirius who had come to help harry was falling over and over again harry squeezed his eyes shut it was voldemort fault not mine if it wasntfor the prophecy harry eyes flew open as the words of the prophecy played in his mind he had not allowed himself to think about the prophecy for some time now but the reality of it now rained over him he had to face voldemort on his own if he were going to succeed he would have to be prepared he could not let his memories get the better of him that what this room was for not only to train the students but to train the only one who could vanquish the dark lord this room was for him the boy who lived harry was not going to let it go to waste tell me again harry ron exclaimed gleefully tell me how you took snape down harry had hurried back to the gryffindor common room exhilarated after his training session he and his professors had battled hard harry determination had paid off after twenty minutes of battling harry had succeeded in taking down his first victim none other than professor snape harry had recounted his evening to ron ginny and hermione who had been pouring over their homework at a table in the common room honestly ron hermione scolded harry told you three times already ron laughed i just cantbelieve it what did snape say after harry shrugged still smiling he didn t say anything when he was revived he just stood up and left the room without a word to anyone ginny narrowed her eyes i cantbelieve him snape canteven acknowledge that you got him fair and square harry he just cantstand to have his poor ego squashed how pathetic ginny hermione scolded you shouldnttalk about your professor that way ginny rolled her eyes and then mumbled sorry hermione hermione was appeased she turned to harry intrigued that room sounds fascinating though i canteven imagine the spells they would have done to create it it must have taken ages harry nodded it really amazing what was professor pandoran like in battle ginny asked harry smiled i didntsee her much but from what i could tell she is really talented i would never have guessed that she could move that quickly she and dumbledore were quite a match i was watching them when mcgonagall got me ron shook his head in disbelief it so strange you ve been in battle against three of our professors harry you could actually jinx them and not get in trouble for it ah i can only dream ron said placing his hand over his heart ronald hermione hissed ron grinned at hermione oh come on hermione you have to admit there been times when you would have loved to hex snape hermione frowned at ron and crossed her arms ron leaned over and nudged her come on admit it with your brains i sure you ve at least imagined trying out some brilliant spell you ve read about hermione blushed as a smile tugged at her lips she turned to ron well there is a spell or two i ve thought of using on you ron grinned as harry and ginny laughed harry caught ron eye and raised an eyebrow ron blushed and returned to his textbook in front of him ginny examined the roll of parchment in front of her i willing to admit that after this essay mcgonagall gave us i ve imagined trying my bat bogey hex on her ron and hermione nodded sympathetically harry stared at his three best friends he knew that they had been working for at least two hours and they didntlook to be anywhere near finished he sighed and rose to get his school bag from his room he was going to have a late night chapter 16 it starts harry felt a hand on his shoulder shaking him gently he was enjoying a deep sleep although he could not figure out why his pillow was so hard or why he had forgotten to take off his glasses they were pressing painfully into his nose and temple he groaned as he felt the hand shake him again mr potter the hushed voice said harry pried his eyes open and blinked hard trying to bring his gaze into focus peering into his face was professor mcgonagall harry pushed himself up and realized he had fallen asleep in the common room he looked down at the table and saw a pool of drool blurring the words he had written on a piece of parchment sorry professor harry mumbled wiping the corner of his mouth on his sleeve i ll go up to bed now professor mcgonagall looked at harry sadly i afraid not mr potter i ve just come to wake you harry looked up at mcgonagall in surprise concern was etched in her face and harry felt his stomach plummet something had happened what is it professor harry asked struggling to find his voice mcgonagall pressed her lips into a thin line she suddenly looked much older please go up and get mr weasley i will meet you down here after i wake miss granger and miss weasley i imagine they would like to know as well harry mouth had gone dry he nodded to his professor and went quickly to his dormitory he pulled back the hangings around ron bed and shook ron shoulder ron harry whispered urgently ron groaned and swatted his hand at harry ron harry repeated shaking ron a little harder geroff ron groaned pulling the covers over his head harry yanked the covers off get up ron harry hissed thinking desperately for something to convince ron hermione waiting for you ron sat up so quickly that he nearly cracked his head into harry s if harry hadntbeen so worried about the expression on mcgonagall face he would have laughed relentlessy at ron instead he grabbed ron arm and pulled him off his bed where are we going ron mumbled fumbling with his robe mcgonagall downstairs she got something to tell us ron was suddenly fully awake his eyes widened as he looked at harry what did she say ron asked hesitantly harry shook his head nothing yet other than for me to wake you up she gone to get hermione and ginny ron followed harry down the stairs the common room was empty ron ran his fingers through his hair and looked at harry what do you reckon happened harry stomach twisted he shook his head saying hoarsely i dontknow the sound of footsteps on the stairs leading to the girls dormitory caused harry and ron to stare at them anxiously professor mcgonagall appeared followed by hermione and ginny both looking rather frazzled come sit down professor mcgonagall said motioning for the chairs in front of the empty fireplace she walked over and flicked her wand causing a roaring fire to appear instantly hermione ron and ginny sat down on the couch while mcgonagall and harry settled into two of the armchairs the students stared at their professor silently professor mcgonagall clasped her hands in her lap and peered at them gravely professor dumbledore asked me to come and give you the news he didntthink it appropriate for you to find out from the daily prophet mcgonagall paused surveying her students there been an attack in london the casualties have not yet been determined however both nymphadora tonks and kingsley shacklebolt are missing harry doubled over feeling as though a sledgehammer had been swung heavily into his stomach he heard hermione and ginny gasp harry stared at the floor willing himself not to vomit he raised his eyes to his professor what happened he croaked professor mcgonagall pursed her lips i canttell you much shacklebolt and tonks were following a lead the ministry received on death eater activity apparently it was a trap harry held his head in his hands the enormity of the situation overwhelming him he took a deep breath it has started then mcgonagall nodded her head slowly yes mr potter it appears it has the second war had officially begun perhaps the incident on harry birthday had been a warning although harry wouldntput it past voldemort to think it just a game however a deliberate attack a staged leak of information and a calculated trap the war had definitely begun professor mcgonagall stared into the fire i know the four of you were acquainted with shacklebolt and tonks i imagine you re quite close to tonks especially having spent most of the summer with her harry thoughts moved to remus he must be worried sick and he was all alone at grimmauld place harry stood up i ve got to go see remus he all alone he ll be professor mcgonagall raised her hand dontworry harry professor dumbledore has gone to be with remus harry body shook involuntarily his knees felt weak as his stomach continued to tie itself into knots he returned to his seat professor mcgonagall stood and addressed the four students i imagine it would do me no good to tell you to get some sleep she paused looking at them sadly i will let you know as soon as we hear anything she swept out of the common room leaving harry ginny ron and hermione stricken harry raised his eyes as he heard a small whimper from hermione she had her face in her hands as she cried softly ron put his arm around her and pulled her into his chest harry glanced at ginny she had her arms wrapped around herself as she stared into the fire her expression blank her face was pale and her jaw was clenched harry walked over and kneeled in front of her looking into her eyes she blinked her eyes and then focused them on harry she opened her mouth and whispered tonks harry nodded as he felt his breath catch in his throat ginny eyes filled with tears she leaned forward as harry wrapped his arms around her harry mind raced as he held ginny the unknown seeming worse than an absolute truth not knowing where shacklebolt and tonks were allowed his mind to imagine horrible fates harry hoped his imagination was nowhere near the truth harry ron ginny and hermione sat red eyed and somber at the gryffindor table in the great hall they pushed their breakfast around their plates absent mindedly their thoughts far from hogwarts the great hall was nearly empty as it was still quite early they had not returned to bed but sat silently comforting each other until morning they had dressed quickly and quietly and walked to the great hall together harry pushed his plate away realizing that trying to eat was futile his stomach had not stopped its twisting and adding food to the mix was not a good idea you should eat harry hermione said automatically harry raised his eyes to her she was staring at the tabletop her plate untouched she met harry gaze and attempted a small smile her bottom lip trembled i hate not knowing she whispered frantically harry reached his hand across the table and set it on top of hermione s ron lifted his hand and rubbed hermione back soothingly ginny set her hand on top of harry s they sat in silence waiting the great hall filled around them the cheerful chatter of students seemed misplaced harry felt like yelling at everyone to be quiet but realized that they did not know no one had told them that the war had begun hey ginny there you are dean strode across the hall smiling broadly his smile faded as he approached the group what up with you lot you all look as though your best friend has died harry ron hermione and ginny glared at dean who was oblivious to the inappropriateness of his comment what going on he asked the hoot of owls caused everyone focus to be diverted they watched silently as hundreds of owls swooped through the air a large brown owl landed in front of hermione carrying the daily prophet hermione stared at the owl apprehensively it was not until it nipped her sharply on the hand that she jumped and slipped a coin into its leather pouch and untied the newspaper from its leg the newspaper unfurled in front of them a large picture covered the front page harry felt nauseous glittering in the sky above a muggle filled street was a distinguishable dark mark hermione pulled the newspaper in front of her and read aloud attack leaves ten dead dozens injured our own daily prophet correspondent alice mcnab has confirmed the shocking news of a death eater attack in the heart of london late last night mcnab arrived at the london location early this morning to find the street in ruins i have not seen devastation like this in years mcnab reported it reminded me of the years when you know who was at the height of his power while there have been no confirmed sightings of you know who since his appearance at the ministry of magic this spring the attack this morning is reminiscent of his past actions of nearly fifteen years ago there is no indication why the death eaters chose this street as their target mcnab reported the area is a quiet neighbourhood populated mainly by muggles the ministry has not confirmed the rumours that several ministry aurors were on duty in the area at the time of the attack minister of magic cornelius fudge has refused to comment on the incident hermione pushed the paper away from her and put her face in her hands well of course fudge wouldntcomment ron said bitterly he d actually have to take a stand dean sat down beside ginny did you already know about this he asked quietly ginny nodded glancing at the others mcgonagall woke us to tell us dean frowned why ginny shifted in her seat unsure of what information to give dean none of the students knew about the order of the phoenix never mind the connection that ginny harry ron and hermione had with it ginny swallowed we know one of the aurors that was there she a friend of the family and she missing dean face fell i sorry ginny ginny nodded as she leaned stiffly on the table harry looked at ginny sympathetically knowing full well the difficulty of keeping secrets hermione raised her head from her hands this didntreally tell us anything new she said frowning at the paper we re no further ahead now than we were hours ago they stared at the image of the street in ruins with the dark marks dancing overhead on the front of the newspaper whatever solace they were hoping the newspaper would bring they had not found it instead they were filled with more dread more anxiety and more frustration hermione crumpled the paper in her hand and threw it across the table harry stared at hermione stunned other than the time she stormed out of divination class hermione was usually so level headed it was rare for her to show such frustration ron reached over and grabbed hermione clenched fist with his hand he squeezed her hand gently it will be okay hermione ron said softly she turned her eyes on him her voice shrill how do you know how can everything be okay her eyes burned into his filled with anger fear and pain ron shook his head and said quietly i dontknow i just have to believe it hermione sobbed and wrapped her arms around ron neck ron stroked hermione back whispering words of comfort softly into her ear dean seemed unnerved by hermione behaviour harry heard dean whisper to ginny so this is quite serious then this attack ginny turned to face dean are you seriously asking me that question harry swallowed if dean had never experienced a weasley temper before he was about to dean seemed to be frozen in his seat unsure whether he d be better off replying or staying quiet ginny didntgive him the opportunity did you hear the headline dean ten muggles were killed killed dean and dozens more injured v voldemort back death eaters are attacking innocent people and you re asking if the situation is serious what wrong with you dean stared at ginny open mouthed ginny face was red and her eyes glinted dangerously excuse me i need to be alone ginny stood and stormed out of the great hall leaving dean gaping after her harry lessons were particularly painful that morning snape seemed exceedingly hateful towards harry during his potions lesson harry imagined it had to do with the events in the training room but he couldntbe sure snape behaviour did not go unnoticed by harry fellow classmates especially when snape took twenty points from gryffindor for harry quill scratching too loudly as he wrote parvati had opened her mouth to protest but harry put his hand on her arm and shook his head snape didntneed excuses to deduct more points from gryffindor the rest of the morning was only a slight improvement over potions flitwick had assigned another essay to be done over the weekend dealing with very complicated shield charms even care of magical creatures was a nightmare harry had not noticed when the rain had started but by the time they were heading to hagrid hut for their class the rain was coming down in sheets hagrid however couldnthave been happier he was overjoyed that the students were able to see the augureys leave their nests as they escaped to enjoy the rain the sight of the pathetic birds only depressed harry more the students clambered up the hill toward the castle at the end of class dispirited and drenched harry allowed hermione to perform a drying spell on his robes before he headed to the library at lunch he still had no appetite and he had yet to finish the homework he had drooled all over the previous evening despite ron and hermione protests that he should eat something harry ran up to the library to take advantage of the time to work uninterrupted he threw himself down in a chair and pulled his books out of his bag a shadow fell across him hi harry harry looked up and saw ginny standing in front of him he smiled weakly hey gin she sat down beside him have you heard anything yet harry shook his head ginny sighed do you mind if i work beside you of course not harry replied ginny leaned over her bag and pulled two large books out and plopped them on the table she opened the top book and began poring over it harry stared at ginny as her forehead crinkled in concentration despite the circles under her eyes harry marveled at how pretty she looked harry shook his head where did that come from he turned back to his homework trying to ignore the odd sensation he was feeling in the pit of his stomach maybe i should have eaten harry thought to himself harry stared at his drool smudged parchment and began to recopy it he then turned to his transfiguration text and researched the information he needed to complete the assignment he wondered if mcgonagall had noticed that it was homework for her class that he had fallen asleep on last night he wrote quickly and hastily it was definitely not his best work but it would have to do harry glanced at ginny and noticed that she had fallen asleep her head rested on her arms on top of the open book and her hair fell all around her harry reached over and brushed her hair away from her face she looked so peaceful with her eyes closed and her face relaxed without the stresses of the day weighing on her mind harry smiled merlin she beautiful there it was again a completely foreign thought had passed through harry mind unwittingly what wrong with me harry mind raced trying to find answers to his own questions flying through his mind you haventslept and you haventeaten your body gone mad it malfunctioning there could be no other reason harry leaned over and touched ginny arm ignoring the jolt it sent through him he shook her arm gently ginny jerked upright her eyes wide harry grinned at her harry how could you let me fall asleep she scolded her cheeks burning bright harry laughed oh you re blaming me are you ginny blushed deeper and punched harry playfully on the arm she groaned as she surveyed her open book how does anyone stand a chance in history of magic it so boring dontlet hermione hear you say that harry warned teasingly ginny wrinkled her nose hermione can shove it up her ginny harry exclaimed laughing ginny sighed honestly do we have to love all of our subjects and all of our teachers all of the time harry shook his head definitely not right now i pretty much hate every one of them ginny grinned at harry causing his stomach to flip thanks harry i needed to hear that harry smiled and gathered his books together i going to grab something to eat do you want to come ginny shrugged sure i guess i should try and eat something today i am feeling a bit strange you re not the only one have you heard anything professor professor mcgonagall stared down at harry hermione and ron they had rushed into their transfiguration class before the other students in hopes of receiving new information i afraid not she frowned as i said this morning i will let you know as soon as i can harry ron and hermione moved slowly to their desks harry sat behind ron and hermione slouching in his chair he hadntnoticed parvati sit beside him harry harry looked up and saw parvati eyeing him curiously her forehead wrinkled as she asked are you okay harry straightened in his chair and nodded she stared at him you ve seemed distracted all day harry looked at parvati he noticed how concerned she looked did you hear about the death eater attacks in london he asked parvati nodded harry sighed i know a couple people that were there at the time they re still missing parvati eyes widened i sorry harry are you close to them harry nodded yeah one of them is a good friend of mine parvati laid a hand on harry arm let me know if i can do anything harry smiled at her kindness thanks harry would not have been able to tell anyone what happened during the remainder of class while his books were open and his quill poised above his parchment harry stared blankly at his desk he was becoming increasingly worried if tonks and shacklebolt were all right shouldntthey have heard something by now harry jumped to his senses as the sounds of scraping chairs met his ears the students around him were packing their bags and leaving the classroom harry looked down at his blank piece of parchment here parvati said holding a piece of parchment out to him you can copy my notes harry stared at her you donthave to parvati smiled i want to i ll get them back from you over the weekend harry nodded and smiled at her gratefully that was the second time she had helped cover for him in class harry placed the parchment and his text in his bag and slung it over his shoulder he turned to ron and hermione ready to go they nodded and followed harry and parvati in the direction of professor pandoran classroom they had a double defense against the dark arts class to end the week normally harry would have been pleased but the prospect of sitting through another class was not appealing have you got any skiving snackboxes on you ron harry asked wearily harry hermione scolded ron grinned i wish i did mate hermione frowned and clicked her tongue parvati turned to ron arentskiving snackboxes those things that fred and george were testing out last year ron nodded yeah they ve got all kinds now they re a top seller in their shop parvati smiled so they re doing well then ron shrugged yeah they seem to mr potter all four students turned at the sound of harry name being called professor mcgonagall was rushing towards him harry stomach dropped to his feet mr potter i ve just received word you re to come with me to the headmaster office professor mcgonagall said as she approached him ron stepped forward we re coming too i afraid not mr weasley mcgonagall said sternly only mr potter will be coming with me ron and hermione stared at mcgonagall angrily i sorry professor mcgonagall said softening her expression please inform professor pandoran not to expect harry for class today ron and hermione faces frowned with worry harry swallowed waved a goodbye to ron hermione and parvati and turned to follow professor mcgonagall they walked in silence to dumbledore office harry felt his heart pounding in his chest he tried frantically to prepare himself for whatever news he was about to hear fearing the worst they stepped onto the revolving staircase and soon faced the large oak door mcgonagall knocked softly and then opened the door harry heart leapt into his throat remus chapter 17 tonks fate harry rushed over and threw his arms around remus they hugged each other tightly like father and son harry pulled back and stared at his godfather remus face was drawn fresh lines seemed to have appeared across his face and his eyes looked sad harry throat tightened is it tonks harry asked his voice cracking with emotion remus shook his head slowly i dontknow dumbledore asked me to come here he didntsay why harry looked around the room professor mcgonagall had disappeared leaving remus and harry alone in the office harry returned his gaze to remus you should sit down harry said ushering remus to a chair you look pale remus smiled softly arenti supposed to take care of you harry smiled we take care of each other remus nodded and sunk into the chair he put his head in his hands harry stared at his godfather as much as harry cared for tonks he suspected that remus feelings for her ran much deeper although remus had never admitted it to harry harry heart ached for his godfather as he sank into the chair beside remus they sat silently their still bodies belying the frantic pace of their minds they had both been summoned and now could do nothing but wait harry stared at the scarlet quill on dumbledore desk the deep red of the feather seemed to burn brightly as the light of the afternoon sun filtered through the window casting a warm glow into the room harry felt anything but warmth as his stomach clenched painfully once again a flash in dumbledore fireplace caused both remus and harry to jump two revolving figures appeared one seeming to carry the other dumbledore stepped forward with tonks in his arms harry mouth went dry tonks was in bad shape harry could see a deep gash near her left temple which seemed to go down to the bone her right cheek was scratched heavily and the white of her right eye was red with blood her left arm was strapped across her chest and was bent at a funny angle there was blood all over her robes remus rushed forward as dumbledore set tonks gently on her feet she swayed slightly gripping dumbledore arm with her right hand she turned her gaze to remus and smiled painfully hey wolfman she said her voice barely audible and scratchy remus eyes filled with tears as he stared at tonks he turned to dumbledore what do we need to do i believe minerva has prepared my guestroom for tonks madam pomfrey is waiting there to tend to her harry if you could help remus take her upstairs harry stared at the staircase that rose behind dumbledore desk he had always wondered where it led he was about to find out remus scooped tonks up into his arms ignoring her protests that she could walk harry followed behind professor mcgonagall met them at the top of the staircase this way she said harry followed them down a narrow hallway the walls were a dark mahogany and were bare of any pictures mcgonagall led them past several doors before opening a door on the right this room was startling bright compared to the dark hallway a four poster bed took up nearly the entire room it was covered in a thick white quilt and at least a dozen pillows madam pomfrey was waiting beside the bed put her here dear madam pomfrey instructed remus turning down the covers on the bed and shifting some of the pillows aside remus walked over and gently placed tonks on the bed he stepped back to let madam pomfrey do her work she worked quickly mending the broken arm and the deep gash across the temple she ordered harry and remus to turn around as she removed tonks bloodied robe and replaced it with pajamas she then fed tonks several potions and cleaned her scratches before stepping aside madam pomfrey turned to remus i ll be back early this evening to check on her try to keep her comfortable and dontlet her do anything unnecessary remus nodded and thanked madam pomfrey as she left the room he turned to tonks how are you doing he asked sitting down softly beside her harry stood awkwardly near the door not sure why dumbledore had sent him up with remus and feeling as though he were intruding on a private moment between remus and tonks tonks smiled i fine just a few scratches remus shook his head his eyes filled with tears you gave us quite a scare tonks reached up and caressed remus cheek i sorry she said softly harry really felt like he shouldntbe there remus ran his eyes over her bruised and scratched face do you feel like talking about it tonks shook her head as her eyes filled with tears not yet remus nodded and ran his fingers lightly across her unscratched cheek how about some sleep tonks nodded blinking her tears away sleep would be nice harry backed slowly towards the door remus leaned forward and kissed her lightly on the lips i love you tonks harry froze tonks grinned at remus so this is what i had to do to get you to admit it remus laughed softly and then kissed her again sweet dreams only of you she replied closing her eyes and smiling remus walked past harry and out the door harry followed him out closing the door softly behind him remus took a few steps down the hall and then fell to his knees harry ran forward and crouched beside remus on the floor remus was holding his head in his hands harry put his hand on remus back consolingly remus shoulders shuddered as he took a ragged breath he lifted his pale drawn face to harry s i thought i had lost her harry throat constricted as he stared into his godfather eyes and saw pain fear and relief harry throat burned he fought to find his voice tonks is going to be okay harry said hoarsely remus nodded staring at the floor i dontknow what i would do without her harry smiled i thought there was something going on with you two this summer remus smiled at harry i have no idea what she sees in a shabby old bachelor like me harry grinned at remus old no shabby yes what is she thinking remus shoved harry lightly harry laughed and then said seriously you re one of the kindest and most generous people in the world remus she sees that remus shook his head whatever it is i consider myself lucky remus rose to his feet let find somewhere a bit more comfortable to sit harry stood up and followed remus back down the hallway remus paused at an open door on the right and peered in ah remus dumbledore said please come in and sit down harry followed remus into the room it was a small room with three couches set in a u shape in front of a large fireplace the room was inviting and comforting dumbledore stood in front of the fireplace with mcgonagall minerva and i have some business to attend to please make yourselves comfortable dumbledore said pointing to the couches he studied remus over his half moon spectacles how is nymphadora remus remus cleared his throat she will be fine she resting right now dumbledore nodded she been through more than most could survive it will take some time harry swallowed hard as he glanced at remus whose lips were pressed into a thin line and his forehead was creased deep with worry dumbledore inclined his head toward remus and harry please excuse us i will be back shortly dumbledore walked toward the door but paused beside harry i ll leave him in your capable hands dumbledore said softly to harry nodding his head in remus direction harry nodded yes professor remus had already moved to one of the couches where he sat silently staring into the fire harry moved to the couch opposite of remus and sat down can i get you anything remus harry asked remus shook his head no thanks they sat silently once again the fire crackled and popped merrily harry stared into it finding the gentle flicker of the flames soothing his thoughts moved to remus and tonks and the conversation he had witnessed between them harry looked at remus so that was the first time you told tonks you love her remus eyes darted to harry in surprise remus ran his hands through his hair yeah remus sighed i wish i had said it sooner it shouldnthave taken something like this for me to say it i dontknow why i never told her harry watched his godfather with interest harry would never claim to have any expertise in the area of love and he was intrigued by remus openness with him remus continued i guess i was scared scared of what i not sure i ve lost so many people that were close to me i guess i thought by denying my feelings for her it would hurt less if i did lose her remus voice began to shake nothing prepared me for this when dumbledore told me that she had been taken harry eyes burned as he listened to remus harry had his own pain and losses all of which remus shared harry however could not imagine losing someone he was in love with remus shook his head i was so grateful that dumbledore was there he has a way with words that no one else does harry nodded his head thinking of the many times dumbledore words had comforted him that he does remus looked at harry and smiled he leaned forward so when are you going to get a girlfriend harry mouth dropped open as he felt his face burn oh i er i dontknow remus prodded anyone in mind harry shrugged his face feeling as though it were on fire remus nodded and her name is ginny harry shook his head in shock bloody hell what are you thinking potter have you gone completely mad where is this coming from harry swallowed and answered remus parvati remus raised his eyebrows and smiled i remember parvati she a very nice girl harry nodded pushing his aberrant thoughts of ginny aside i ve been spending a lot of time with her lately remus leaned back on the sofa folding his arms behind his head i happy for you harry he then frowned it funny though i ve always thought you d get together with sorry to keep you waiting dumbledore said gliding into the room he glanced at harry and remus am i interrupting anything remus shook his head no professor i ve just been harassing harry about the women in his life dumbledore eyes twinkled as he looked at harry is that so harry shot a glance at remus as his face turned red once again dumbledore sighed i sorry to put an end to your fun remus i afraid the news i bring will be a stark contrast the room fell silent remus and harry leaned forward in their seats their eyes on dumbledore dumbledore settled himself on the couch facing the fireplace dumbledore took a moment to survey harry and remus before beginning the usual sparkle in his eyes absent i must warn you the events of last night are among the worst i have ever heard it is difficult enough to know and even harder to tell harry and remus nodded and swallowed dumbledore began as you know remus nymphadora and kingsley were assigned to investigate the lead the ministry received about a possible meeting place for voldemort and his death eaters remus nodded this meeting place was said to be an abandoned warehouse in a muggle neighbourhood if voldemort wanted to remain in hiding a muggle surrounded warehouse would be the last place we would look when we realized this we thought it was brilliant on voldemort part rather than suspecting the information to be wrong we credited him with being so clever as to gather his followers right under our noses when nymphadora and kingsley arrived they found the building not abandoned but full of muggles it was a three story office building on a normal day the area would be fairly abandoned at that time of day it just so happened that the company was holding a family supper for its employees in a sectioned off area in the street therefore dozens of muggles were present for the company celebration from what nymphadora and my other sources were able to tell me no one stood a chance while there were not even a dozen death eaters there they did more than enough damage they set fires all over the building they levitated cars uprooted trees and blasted walls open at whim dumbledore paused swallowed hard and took a ragged breath they tore children from their mother arms and tied the children together in the middle of the street as they sent curses at their parents they spared no one it is in fact surprising that there were any survivors dumbledore paused he seemed to be struggling to maintain his composure a very unusual sight nymphadora and kingsley got as many muggles to safety as they could they were both however captured my understanding is that the death eaters used them as an example to demonstrate their power to the muggles they tortured nymphadora and kingsley for sport and for prestige after the death eaters had finished with kingsley and nymphadora they were taken away no one is sure where they were taken nymphadora was found in an alleyway near the ministry of magic only an hour ago kingsley is still missing harry was horrified it was worse than he had imagined he had never believed that people could be so cruel he thought of tonks who lay in a bed down the hall physically and mentally broken and shacklebolt he was still missing was he still with the death eaters was he still being tortured was he still alive harry was startled by a fierce groan by remus i feel so helpless remus exclaimed harry body shook he had never seen remus in such a state remus eyes were blazing and a fierce power seemed to exude from him if harry had not known and loved this man he would have been terrified of him harry stared at his godfather we all feel helpless at times such as these it does not do to dwell on the anger remus if your heart is full of anger your mind is full of waste do not cloud your heart and mind with anger remus you have more experience than most when it comes to controlling your emotions and actions i hate to ask more of you but you must focus that energy into determination and will do it for yourself do it for nymphadora do it for harry remus leaned forward his head in his hands his elbows on his knees harry watched as remus shoulders began to shake harry couldntstand to see his godfather in such pain he stood and walked to remus side and sat down he put his arm around remus shoulders harry did not say anything there was nothing to say they sat there for some time harry sat beside remus observing remus eventual steadying of breath remus took a deep breath and then sat up straight he clapped his hand on harry knee thanks harry harry nodded that what i here for remus swallowed i glad harry smiled me too remus turned to dumbledore who had been staring thoughtfully into the fire forgive me professor remus said i hope you dontthink me ungrateful but i must ask why was tonks brought here st mungo would have been much closer dumbledore nodded and smiled at remus first thing ungrateful and remus lupin will never go together as far as st mungo s i not sure if everyone can still be trusted there voldemort has demonstrated that he has increased his factions already and there could be many more people under the imperius curse i knew poppy would be able to treat nymphadora i thought it best to treat her here in my quarters rather than the hospital wing we dontneed any overly curious students interrupting her rest remus nodded of course professor a slight twinkle returned to dumbledore eyes remus we ve moved well beyond the professor student relationship please call me albus remus smiled i dontknow if i could ever get used to that dumbledore nodded i expect nymphadora will need to stay here for a few days before moving back to headquarters remus you are of course welcome to stay remus smiled gratefully thank you profes albus dumbledore smiled and then moved his gaze to harry harry i must compliment you on your maturity and composure i had hoped you would be a comfort for remus and i was not disappointed we all need our family in times like these harry swallowed yes thank you professor dumbledore continued i also asked you to be here because you more than anyone else need to know what the death eaters are capable of i do not plan on sharing the details of the attack with any other students nor most of the staff i apologize if you find the information difficult to bear but i think it best for you to know the enemy completely harry nodded yes sir dumbledore frowned at harry how was your first week back at school harry shrugged it was fine dumbledore nodded not too busy harry shook his head not at all i managed just fine dumbledore turned to remus you should have seen him in the training room remus harry did remarkably well remus smiled how was it harry harry glanced at professor dumbledore he returned his gaze to remus and replied grinning brilliant i got to jinx snape remus laughed out loud i imagine he didnttake that too well harry smiled no he didn t suddenly professor mcgonagall strode quickly into the room i sorry to intrude headmaster there are three students in your office demanding to see you dumbledore eyes twinkled i imagine there are two weasleys and one granger mcgonagall glanced at harry and nodded curtly dumbledore turned to harry i sure they would be satisfied with seeing you harry instead of me i expect they are looking for some answers harry nodded and stood yes professor i ll go remus stood and hugged harry i ll see you soon harry nodded see you soon take good care of tonks remus smiled i will i promise harry exited the room and walked down the dark hallway to the top of the staircase he paused and took a deep breath telling his best friends what tonks had gone through was not going to be easy chapter 18 girls and quidditch harry frowned as he stared into the mirror nervously trying to flatten his hair it was saturday evening and he had just returned from the great hall he was to meet parvati in the common room in a few minutes to work on their potions essay harry tried to reason with himself he and parvati were just meeting to do homework there was no need for the odd twisting of his stomach nevertheless harry continued to feel the pressure of a first date harry sighed at his reflection and turned away from the mirror he picked up his school bag slung it over his shoulder took a deep breath and then headed down the stairs to the common room harry paused as he reached the bottom of the stairs and scanned the room his eyes first fell on ron and hermione sitting in their usual seats by the fireplace hermione had a huge book on her lap she was pointing to something on the page and talking to ron as he stared at her avidly harry smiled and doubted that ron was hearing a word that hermione was saying a flicker of red caught harry eye from the armchair facing away from him harry saw a mane of red hair fall over the edge of the chair and two fluffy slippered feet appear on the opposite side harry felt an odd sensation in his chest and frowned ginny had taken the news of tonks injuries the worst last night when harry had told his friends about the attack harry had stayed up with ginny long after ron and hermione had gone to bed comforting her he had also gone with her to dumbledore office that morning and stood beside her as she demanded to see tonks harry smiled as he remembered the look on dumbledore face when ginny had told dumbledore that she was going to see tonks or be expelled trying dumbledore had graciously allowed them in while tonks had looked better than the previous day the sight of her injuries had been hard on ginny harry had sat with remus while tonks hugged ginny and reassured her that she would be fine harry had been amazed by the love and concern that ginny had shown for tonks harry was thinking about walking over to see how ginny was doing when he felt a hand on his arm he turned his gaze and found himself staring into parvati brown eyes she smiled you look a million miles away what are you thinking about harry felt his cheeks flush as he darted his eyes quickly to the curtain of red hair hanging over the side of the armchair he looked back to parvati n nothing parvati raised an eyebrow as her hand slid down his arm and clutched his hand come on she said pulling harry with her hand harry followed her feeling as though his feet were abnormally large causing him to stumble slightly he cursed at himself and began to panic feeling sweat beginning to bead on his skin harry cringed as he realized how his clammy hand must feel to parvati harry nearly stumbled again as parvati stopped abruptly she had steered him to a secluded table in the corner of the room she turned to him and asked is this table okay with you harry swallowed and nodded sure parvati smiled and released harry hand as she swung her bag on top of the table and settled herself in a chair harry discreetly wiped his hands on his robes wishing he would stop sweating harry stood awkwardly trying to decide whether he should sit beside parvati or across from her she saved him the confusion she turned in her seat and looked up at him smiling sit here she said patting the seat beside her harry nodded and sat down beside parvati he turned his head and glanced around the common room harry groaned inwardly as he saw many curious eyes staring at parvati and him his gaze moved to the fireplace from this point of view harry now saw only the back of ron and hermione heads but saw ginny head on as she sat sideways in her chair she was leaning her head against the back of the chair and her eyes were closed harry smiled ginny looked so peaceful should we get started harry harry jumped and turned to look at parvati she was removing her books from her school bag and was setting them on the table she paused and smiled at harry sure harry said leaning over and grabbing his own books harry cast one last glance at ginny then turned to parvati where should we start harry asked parvati began flipping through one of the thick books she had placed on the table well i got these books from the library this afternoon i ve marked the pages that i think are relevant for the clarity potion harry swallowed feeling guilty that parvati was yet again bailing him out of being hopelessly behind in his homework i sorry you had to spend the afternoon in the library you always seem to be doing all the work harry said parvati smiled at harry i would have had to get these books whether or not we were working together i just sharing my resources harry shook his head smiling i still feel like i owe you a huge favour parvati cocked an eyebrow at harry well dontworry i sure i ll think of a way for you to make it up to me harry stared at parvati wondering if he had imagined the suggestive tone in her voice the sparkle in her eyes and the smile playing on her lips told him he had not imagined anything parvati leaned her elbow on the table so where were you this afternoon anyway harry shifted in his seat slouching slightly harry took a deep breath realizing if he hoped to continue seeing parvati he would have to share a bit more of himself with her i had a meeting with mr brooks parvati eyebrows arched really harry nodded moving his gaze to the table top yeah i ve met with him a few times this week he thinks my encounters with voldemort might help him understand voldemort better and then he can use the information to enhance his security measures harry glanced at parvati she was staring at him with her mouth hanging open and her eyes wide oh great she thinks i a freak wow the head of security is asking for your help harry felt his face flush he straightened in his chair and rested his elbows on the table er i guess so wow parvati whispered harry glanced at parvati and saw her staring at him her eyes wide harry cleared his throat should we get started then parvati blinked and nodded sure she pushed the open book towards harry here you can start with this one thanks harry replied thankful to have her stop staring at him harry pulled the book towards himself and began reading you said his name parvati whispered harry raised his eyes from his book to look at parvati pardon you said his name parvati repeated looking keenly at harry harry brows furrowed together you mean voldemort parvati jumped and then nodded arentyou scared of him she whispered harry shrugged i may fear the man but i dontfear his name parvati eyes widened further you re really brave harry harry shook his head i dontfeel brave i never knew you were so modest parvati said smiling there a lot you dontknow about me harry thought harry shrugged there a few people that would disagree with you parvati leaned toward harry well i never did listen much to other people opinions harry smiled well that good to hear harry looked at parvati and noticed how her eyes sparkled as she smiled at him parvati placed her hand on harry leg and looked straight into harry eyes i really like you harry harry swallowed as his heart pounded in his chest okay if you re going to do it now the time i i harry stammered harry harry jumped and turned his head to see ron walking towards him harry i need to talk to you ron said as he arrived at the table harry glanced at parvati and had to choke down a laugh she was glaring at ron with the utmost loathing harry turned to ron can it wait harry asked nodding his head toward parvati ron glanced at parvati and raised his eyebrows as he met her glare he returned his gaze to harry sorry mate did i interrupt something yes parvati answered shortly ron face flushed as he looked at parvati right sorry we ll talk later then harry smiled thanks ron ron nodded arched an eyebrow at parvati and then turned and walked away harry turned to parvati and grinned sorry ron not used to having to share me with anyone parvati smiled at harry and said softly is it something he going to have to get used to harry looked into parvati hopeful eyes he cleared his throat yes i think so parvati smiled prettily i not very good at sharing either harry smiled and took her hand into his it time he swallowed and found courage he didntknow he had well i guess i ll have to tell ron that my girlfriend comes first parvati blushed and smiled at harry who the lucky girl she asked quietly harry shrugged and turned to look around the common room dunno see any good one around parvati punched harry lightly on the arm harry laughed and turned to parvati oh look there one right here he said teasingly he took her other hand into his and held both of her hands in front of him i was thinking of asking you parvati parvati eyes sparkled brightly really she asked really harry smiled and took a deep breath what do you think will you be my girlfriend parvati smiled and whispered yes harry smiled and leaned towards parvati i glad to hear that parvati leaned forward harry met her lips and kissed her softly enjoying the tingle spreading throughout him a series of catcalls from the other side of the common room caused harry to pull away potter finally been caught seamus yelled standing on his chair i never thought it would happen potter finally been caught by a girl an era has ended harry groaned and looked at parvati who was blushing and grinning i promise to hex him in his sleep tonight harry said parvati laughed no that okay i just need to remind him that lavender tells all and i know things about him that he wished i didn t harry laughed out loud seamus and lavender parvati nodded oh yes they had quite a few broom closet encounters last year harry shook his head still laughing i had no idea parvati looked at him and smiled not many people did like i said lavender tells me everything harry raised an eyebrow do you tell her everything parvati grinned why are you worried harry returned her grin should i be parvati laughed dontworry harry i wontkiss and tell harry smiled i guess if we keep kissing during class and in the common room everyone will know everything anyway parvati raised an eyebrow perhaps we need to find our own broom closet harry face burned red i didntmean we dontneed harry stammered parvati leaned forward well i dontknow about you harry but i dontown an invisibility cloak and i dontwant an audience every time we kiss she leaned closer to harry and now that i officially your girlfriend i plan on kissing you a lot harry swallowed and felt his face flush again right harry managed before parvati lips were on his again wake up loverboy harry groaned as the hangings around his bed were yanked open and the sunlight burned his eyes harry rolled onto his stomach and pulled his pillow over his head come on harry ron said or do you not have time for your best mate anymore harry sighed and pushed himself up and glared at ron i have plenty of time for my friends that dontwake me at such an indecent hour ron laughed since when is ten in the morning indecent what harry asked grabbing his glasses and glancing at his clock why d you let me sleep so late ron raised an eyebrow and said sarcastically right sorry mate it all my fault harry smiled apologetically sorry thanks for waking me up ron nodded i need to talk to you anyway remember harry nodded right just let me jump in the shower and i ll meet you in the common room harry watched as ron ears turned red actually ron said i was hoping to talk to you up here harry frowned what wrong mate ron blush deepened well last night i needed to talk to you about quidditch but now harry leaned forward but now ron sighed it hermione birthday in a couple weeks harry nodded and ron stared at the floor his hands in his pockets i need your help harry raised an eyebrow with what ron ran a hand nervously through his hair i going to tell her harry mouth dropped open you re what ron looked at harry pleadingly please dontmake this any harder than it already is since i ve finally admitted my feelings for hermione to you i ve realized how much i care for her it making me crazy i need to tell her whether she feels the same way or not i need to know how she feels one way or the other if she feels the same way brilliant if not then at least i ll know and i can try to move on i

in relief help me come up with a brilliant plan to sweep hermione off her feet so she has no choice but to fall madly in love with me harry smiled and said sarcastically oh is that all ron grinned well now that you ve landed yourself a girl you must have some expertise harry laughed i call it luck mate i am definitely not an expert but you ll help ron asked harry nodded absolutely ron smiled thanks harry i know you re busy harry stood and slapped ron on the back never too busy for a friend in need ron grinned i think parvati might disagree with you harry laughed yeah you re probably right ron nodded by the way i meeting with madam hooch and the other house captains tomorrow night to set the quidditch practice schedule are the battle training schedules set harry nodded yeah i have my private training monday nights and then fifth years are on tuesdays sixth years on wednesdays and seventh years are on thursdays training will start a week from tomorrow ron nodded and ran his fingers through his hair right that doesntleave much time for practice but we ll work something out we should have tryouts this week what do you think about friday harry nodded sounds good you mean i can steal you away from your girlfriend ron teased harry raised an eyebrow if she has a problem with quidditch then we had better stop dating right now ron laughed you might want to look into that mate harry nodded wondering what he had got himself into what do you think mate harry asked ron and harry sat in the gryffindor changing room surrounded by their quidditch teammates they had just held the chaser tryouts and it was now decision making time ron cleared his throat well i d say ginny is a given she played well as seeker last year and i think she ll be bloody brilliant as a chaser i am her brother however so if anyone feels my opinion is biased feel free to disagree not a chance ron andrew kirke replied katie bell nodded i d be more concerned if you didntchoose ginny ron ron nodded alright then so that leaves one chaser position to fill any suggestions jack sloper nodded i thought amanda reese looked quite good andrew smirked looked good or played well jack face flushed she played well katie nodded i agree she was really quick on the broom but i thought dennis creevey was better he read the plays really well and seemed to handle the quaffle a bit better ron nodded andrew what do you think andrew shrugged i d be happy with either although i agree with sloper reese is a good looker oops i mean player katie and andrew laughed as jack face turned crimson once again harry stared at his teammates interactions they had obviously developed a strong camaraderie over the remaining of last year quidditch season after harry fred and george were removed from the team harry may have joined in on their banter if he had the energy the past week however had been arduous professor pandoran had met with harry every day to prepare him for the start of the battle training course she had trained him hard both mentally and physically he had met her every morning at dawn to jog around the hogwarts grounds accompanied with a small group of security officials after thirty minutes of jogging pandoran put harry through a series of workouts including sit ups push ups and running through an obstacle course in the training room harry would then go to classes ignoring his aching muscles and trying frantically to stay focused he had then met with pandoran after school each day to prepare the first few weeks for the course after a quick supper harry would spend the evening on homework thankfully with the help of ron hermione and parvati harry had collapsed into bed each night utterly exhausted now that it was friday night harry wanted nothing more than to throw himself in front of the fireplace in the common room and think about nothing that had to do with battle training or homework harry had felt refreshed by the exhilaration of flying during the tryouts but now his exhaustion was overwhelming what do you think harry harry blinked and looked at ron sorry creevey or reese ron asked harry ran through the tryouts of both creevey and reese in his mind it was true they both had their advantages but it was clear that one person fit in better with their playing style than the other harry glanced around at his teammates finding all of their eyes focused on him he looked at ron and replied creevey i think creevey is the better choice ron nodded and looked at katie you agree bell katie nodded yes i think he ll fit in well ron turned to andrew what do you say kirke andrew shrugged i ve got no complaints sloper ron asked turning to jack i know creevey got nothing on reese as far as looks go but do you think he ll make a good chaser jack shot andrew a glare and returned his gaze to ron yes creevey will be great ron clapped his hands together okay we re set let go get our team together then all we have to do is crush everyone in our way and win the cup katie cheered and punched her fist in the air for the cup for the cup everyone chanted following katie out onto the pitch once the announcement of the new team players was made everyone felt the need to celebrate harry hopes of a quiet common room to relax in had been dashed even the students who had tried out but not made the team were celebrating bottles of butterbeer had appeared and everyone was cheering as though gryffindor had already won the cup harry had claimed a seat in front of the fireplace choosing to watch the festivities rather than join in on them come on harry seamus yelled now that you re back as seeker we re guaranteed the cup excuse me finnigan ginny said jabbing her finger into seamus chest i think i remember winning the cup last year when i was seeker seamus grinned oh come on red you ve got to admit you re happy that harry back what did you just call me ginny asked her eyes flashing seamus screamed dramatically dean get your girlfriend away from me dean laughed as he looked from seamus to ginny his smile fading as he met ginny glare ginny dumped her mug of butterbeer over seamus head shoved the empty mug into dean hand and stomped toward the fireplace she threw herself down beside harry scowling harry bit the insides of his cheeks to prevent himself from laughing seamus had simply laughed and dried himself off with his wand dean however looked like a lost child harry grinned he found ginny temper so adorable he looked at ginny and tugged at her ponytail she turned and glared at him what she snapped harry smiled your boyfriend looks a little lost ginny looked at dean and shrugged her shoulders i sure he can find his way if he wants to harry grinned at ginny canthe handle your temper red ginny mouth dropped open tell me you did not just say that potter harry opened his eyes innocently say what red ginny eyes flashed as her hand dove for her wand in her pocket harry was faster and grabbed her wrist making sure to hold it away from her i swear potter you better have a tight grip otherwise you ll be sneezing bat bogeys for weeks harry smiled as he grasped ginny other wrist which was trying to reach his own wand i have an excellent grip red dontyou worry ginny screamed in frustration as she threw herself at harry causing them both to tumble to the floor ginny landed on top of harry as he held her arms up above her ginny wriggled herself upright her eyes no longer flashing angrily but sparkling mischievously she had her knees on either side of harry and was grinning down at him her cheeks flushed what shall i do with you potter ginny said grinning harry smiled maintaining his firm grip on her wrists you dontseem to be in much of a position to do anything gin ginny eyes flashed you seem to forget harry that i ve got six older brothers she smiled dangerously i can play fair or i can play dirty which one shall it be harry looked up at her curiously trying to figure out what she meant ginny began to shift her weight to one knee while the other began to move to harry centre with a sudden realization of what she could do to him harry quickly rolled them over making sure to straddle ginny in such a way that her knees could not be used as weapons he leaned over her smiling that wasntvery nice ginny grinned you learn much faster than my brothers i ll take that as a compliment harry said staring down at ginny ginny cheeks flushed as harry stared at her he noticed how the firelight seemed to dance in her eyes she rolled her eyes and sighed okay harry you ve got me will you let me go ginny said feigning innocence harry studied her expression not sure whether or not she still had her bat bogey hex on her mind are you going to hex me he asked are you going to call me that horrid name again ever ginny asked harry smiled well i dontknow about ever ginny wriggled under his grasp harry laughed okay okay i will never call you that name again ginny glared at him and then smiled fine i wonthex you then harry smiled and pushed himself up pulling ginny up with him they turned and found parvati and dean watching them with confused expressions harry glanced at ginny and saw her take a deep breath ginny walked over to dean and grabbed his hand come on dean i need some more butterbeer dean nodded and walked away with her harry smiled at parvati as she offered him a bottle of butterbeer thanks harry said smiling not daring to turn and watch ginny walk away it a great party dontyou think parvati raised her eyebrows at harry questioningly she nodded hesitantly and said yes it a great party harry slung his arm over parvati shoulder taking a swig from his bottle of butterbeer harry swallowed hard and reminded himself that his girlfriend was the one standing next to him not the adorable red head now on the other side of the room chapter 19 battle training harry ran his fingers nervously over his robes he felt a sweat break out on his skin as he stood beside professor pandoran at the front of her classroom fifth year students were slowly trickling into the room the expressions on their faces varied from apprehensive to excited to scared senseless they all eyed professor pandoran curiously and gaped openly at harry harry shifted on his feet and swallowed you agreed to this potter harry reminded himself hi ya harry colin creevey exclaimed as he bounced to the front of the classroom what are you doing here harry opened his mouth to reply but was cut short by pandoran you ll find out soon enough mr creevey pandoran replied please take a seat colin shot harry an enthusiastic grin then sat down in the front row the classroom was nearly full and the buzz of whispered conversations was becoming louder and louder harry noticed the top of a blonde head hidden behind an upside down book luna lovegood harry realized he hadntseen her at all this year she had been among the group that went to the department of mysteries with harry although he found luna to be rather eccentric harry appreciated the support she had shown the previous year her gaze drifted up and she looked dreamily at harry for a few seconds then returned to her book harry continued to scan the room and felt a smile spread across his face as ginny ran into the room her face flushed and her eyes sparkling harry watched as she scurried into the seat beside colin and whispered something in his ear colin chuckled and shook his head ginny looked up at harry and winked harry felt his cheeks flush slightly as he smiled and nodded his head at her professor pandoran cleared her throat and clapped her hands together all right fifth years let get started the chatter silenced and all eyes were directed to the front of the room welcome to battle training as most of you are already aware i will be your training instructor although i am sure it is unnecessary please allow me to introduce my assistant mr harry potter a new scurry of whispers washed over the students as harry inclined his head towards them formally pandoran cleared her throat bringing the whispers to a halt mr potter is the top student in defense against the dark arts at hogwarts his knowledge and skills in defense exceeds many adult witches and wizards i am honoured to have such a skilled student as my assistant as such you are expected to treat mr potter with the utmost respect treat him as you would any other instructor in this school any behaviour otherwise will result in the appropriate consequences most students nodded their heads in agreement although harry noticed a few students in slytherin robes scowling harry smiled inwardly pandoran turned to harry mr potter will you please explain the format of the course harry nodded and clasped his hands behind his back he straightened himself to his full height and glanced over the students they all looked back at him expectantly harry delved into his explanation his voice strong and confident as with the d a harry fell into the role as teacher flawlessly he went through the expectations of the classroom sessions that would start each lesson and then explained the physical training routine harry then outlined how the battle simulations would be organized before turning to pandoran have i left anything out professor harry asked pandoran smiled broadly not at all she then turned to the class and said let begin with a little review please partner up and practice disarming spells the students partnered up accordingly and harry and pandoran strolled among the students offering suggestions as necessary harry smiled as he approached ginny and colin i cantbelieve you re teaching us harry colin exclaimed wait until dennis finds out he ll be so jealous harry shook his head and grinned at colin enthusiasm he turned his gaze to ginny who was staring at him silently what harry asked ginny face flushed she shook her head and shrugged nothing you just really suit this role well harry i happy for you it was harry turn to blush thanks gin it was fantastic colin creevey exclaimed to anyone who would listen tuesday evening in the gryffindor common room colin ginny and several other fifth years were seated together on the floor giving the details of their first battle training session a group of students of all ages gathered around them to hear the particulars i couldntbelieve it when harry hexed pandoran right in front of us ginny nodded her head in agreement it really was brilliant the training room is amazing i cantbelieve something like that exists in our school she stretched her legs out in front of her the physical training is going to be a nightmare though looking at pandoran i would have never thought she could out run me out push up me or out sit up me i hope i in the same shape as her when i her age the group of fifth years nodded their heads in agreement tell us more dennis pleaded what was the training room like harry sighed as he glanced at the crowd of students on the floor gathered around the fifth years every now and then they would gasp and turn their heads to look at harry he was sitting at a table at the opposite end of the common room trying to work on his homework ron and hermione sat with him although their attention seemed to be drawn to the group on the floor as well hermione glanced at harry as he sighed yet again i sorry harry everyone is just excited you ve had a couple weeks to get used to this whole battle training thing it still new to the rest of us things will get better once everyone has had their first session harry eyed hermione cantyou make them go to bed or something you are a prefect after all hermione sighed harry it nine thirty and they re not doing anything wrong harry ran his fingers through his hair and glanced at the group he felt a strange sensation in his chest as he watched ginny talk animatedly to the group he turned back to the textbook in front of him and continued reading i cantbelieve you didnttell me harry raised his head and saw parvati standing in front of him with her arms crossed harry swallowed and glanced at hermione and ron hermione bit her lower lip as ron raised his eyebrows at parvati pardon harry asked how could you not tell me parvati demanded i your girlfriend and i have to find out from creevey that you re pandoran assistant um ron dontyou have something to show me in your room hermione asked ron quietly pulling on his robes w what n no ron stammered his ears turning pink hermione frowned at him and nodded her head toward harry and parvati oh right i forgot i got a new book you have to see it harry watched ron and hermione stand up and scurry from the table well parvati asked her voice low harry ran his fingers through his hair exasperated i dontknow what to say parvati it wasntsomething i was ready for everyone to know until they had to parvati narrowed her eyes did ron and hermione know harry nodded well yeah they re my best friends parvati pursed her lips together did ginny know harry swallowed and nodded this was not going well parvati moved her gaze to the group on the floor she glared and returned her gaze to harry as your girlfriend you should feel as though you can tell me anything harry harry sighed some things are just too complicated to tell i sorry parvati you re right i should have told you i even asked you why you had so many meetings with pandoran you could have told me then instead of being vague and saying you were helping her with something harry groaned with frustration he could feel anger building up inside of him i ve already apologized parvati what else do you want me to do parvati put her hands on her hips is there anything else you should tell me harry stared at her well you see there this prophecy that says i either have to kill voldemort or be killed by him it no big deal really the whole future of the wizarding world rests on my shoulders that all maybe not no parvati there nothing else for me to tell you parvati surveyed harry through narrowed eyes and then plopped down in the chair opposite him what are you working on she asked resignedly charms homework harry replied feeling his anger subside well i ve finished mine let see what you have so far and maybe i can help harry sighed and pushed his parchment towards her glad that their first fight was over please tell me it not true potter harry sighed as he recognized the familiar sneer behind him he was sitting at the gryffindor table in the great hall after his morning workout with pandoran what not true malfoy harry asked not bothering to turn around that you are assisting pandoran in battle training harry turned and stared hard into malfoy pointy face they glared at each other with mutual loathing what does it matter to you malfoy harry sneered because i refuse to take orders from a filthy half blood like you well i suggest you drop out of battle training then harry said returning to his cereal bowl malfoy scowled and stormed away tonight session promised to be interesting harry once again found himself at the front of pandoran classroom watching students filter in the major difference of course was that tonight he was facing students in his same year harry wasntsure how he d be accepted by his fellow classmates but the encouraging looks he got from the former d a members helped to qualm his worries at least three quarters of the classroom was former d a members from gryffindor there was ron hermione neville dean seamus parvati and lavender from ravenclaw padma patil anthony goldstein michael corner and terry boot from hufflepuff ernie macmillan justin finch fletchley hannah abbot susan bones and zacharias smith the remaining students were from slytherin harry narrowed his eyes as draco walked in with vincent crabbe gregory goyle and pansy parkinson in his wake draco shot harry a disgusted look and slouched into a desk at the back of the room pandoran and harry went through the introduction to the course as they had the previous day after harry had explained the basics of the course professor pandoran addressed the students now it seems that inter house rivalry is particularly excessive among sixth year students at hogwarts i ask you to put aside your differences and learn to stand together we must be united in our fight draco snorted is there a problem mr malfoy pandoran asked draco darted his eyes to harry obviously debating how he should answer i sorry professor i find it difficult to put aside house affiliations when the poster boy for gryffindor is your assistant draco replied haughtily harry clenched his fists together as he shot a steely glare to draco pandoran stared at draco her face unreadable i have already explained why mr potter was chosen for this task i do not appreciate you referring to him as a poster boy for anything i remind you to watch your manners mr malfoy malfoy scowled and muttered i sick of this gryffindor favouritism that will be ten points from slytherin malfoy do you have anything else to add to make it fifty pandoran snarled malfoy crossed his arms across his chest and glared at pandoran no professor pandoran nodded good i dontenjoy taking points from anyone particularly my own house every head in the room snapped towards professor pandoran harry felt his jaw drop as he stared at his professor he had never taken the time to even wonder which house pandoran had belonged to in her day he would never have guessed slytherin professor pandoran smiled blandly apparently this information comes as a surprise to you i understand many of you have particular feelings about the house of slytherin but such broad generalizations are not only unfair but also untrue despite your preconceived notions i assure you i am slytherin through and through pandoran replied her eyes traveling over the students as she spoke now shall we begin harry scanned his team as they huddled around him in the training room harry had been slightly disappointed when both ron and hermione received green badges placing them on pandoran team he was relieved however that parvati was on his team harry knew that ron and hermione would forgive him in a heartbeat if he disabled them in the battle he was not sure parvati would in addition to parvati his team consisted of neville seamus michael corner terry boot justin finch fletchley hannah abbot zacharias smith gregory goyle and pansy parkinson goyle and parkinson looked completely lost without malfoy there to order them around everyone stood in the centre of the large empty classroom of the training room the students had just taken their shield potions and were awaiting direction from their team leaders harry waited silently for pandoran to choose the setting pandoran met harry eye and he nodded with a flick of her wand pandoran chanted hogsmeade one the village of hogsmeade appeared around them causing several gasps among the students harry glanced at pandoran and noticed her already giving instructions to her team harry eyed up his teammates deciding where each member would best fit in harry had no idea what skills goyle and parkinson had but knew they would not be near that of the other members all right harry said quietly here the plan parvati and terry i want you to partner up and go along the right side of the street checking each store along the way hannah and seamus do the same along the left side neville and pansy i want you to head down the alley on the left and try to loop around behind the other team michael and gregory take the right alleyway and do the same justin and zacharias you ve got our backs make sure that the other team cantget in behind us keep the path to hogwarts clear i going to try to make my way straight up the road remember use whatever you can for cover if you come across fallen teammates only revive them if it is safe to do so harry glanced over his shoulder and saw pandoran team dispersing he turned back to his teammates ready all of his teammates nodded even goyle and parkinson harry nodded all right good luck harry watched as his teammates disbanded to their appropriate locations harry followed parvati and terry to the right side of the street they pressed themselves up against the side of the building harry nodded at them silently as they crept up to the door of the three broomsticks harry inched past them continuing his journey up the main road he paused as he watched hannah and seamus disappear into zonko joke shop on the other side of the street his team appeared to be in place harry peered around the corner of the entryway he was standing in to the street ahead of him he saw a stretch of carriages lined along the street after a quick glance around he darted to the closest carriage and squatted beside it he crept along its side and peered inside it empty he continued along his eyes constantly darting up and down the street around him no sign of pandoran team yet harry continued along catching glimpses of parvati terry hannah and seamus as they went in and out of shops along the street harry had just reached the last in the line of carriages he paused and listened hard he could hear footsteps to his left he peered around the edge of the carriage and saw the edge of a cloak disappear on the opposite side of the carriage harry ducked down and looked under the carriage watching the bottom of the robes moving away from him he quickly glanced around to see if anyone else had appeared on the street it seemed to be empty harry edged along the carriage following the footsteps as he reached the opposite end he peered around vincent crabbe was staring dumbly up and down the street this is too easy harry told himself was it some kind of trap as harry debated whether or not he should give his position away by hexing crabbe he heard a voice shout stupefy harry listened as crabbe body fell to the ground suddenly the sound of footsteps and the flash of spells filled the street indeed it had been a trap pandoran team had been waiting patiently and had now descended on harry team mercilessly harry peered around the carriage and saw seamus lying next to crabbe seamus must have been the one to stun crabbe harry darted to the next carriage as parvati and terry burst out of the shop behind him they looked at harry their faces flushed what should we do parvati asked her eyes wide harry looked at her and shrugged we fight harry darted out from behind the carriage and came face to face with dean he shot several spells in his direction before ducking behind the carriage again he glanced at parvati and terry who were both squatting behind the carriage it seems that most of pandoran team are out in the open use these carriages for cover and you should be able to land a few spells i going to look for pandoran harry instructed parvati and terry nodded harry darted out once again from the carriage and ran across to the other side of the street he ducked behind a park bench as a shower of spells landed around him he glanced up and down the street quickly taking in the various duels occurring around him he watched as ernie macmillan easily took down gregory goyle harry threw himself forward and cast a spell in ernie direction ernie fell to the ground harry turned quickly and saw ron approaching him a grin plastered across his face this is bloody brilliant harry ron exclaimed as he sent a curse in harry direction harry grinned as he deflected ron spell good to see you dontplay favourites weasley harry replied sending a curse in ron direction ron laughed as he ducked behind a tree and give up my one and only chance to take down the boy who lived not bloody likely ron shot another spell in harry direction you wontbe taking me down today mate harry exclaimed sending a curse at ron this time it met its target harry felt slightly strange as he ran over his best friend body in pursuit of his next target ron gonna kill me for that one harry smiled to himself harry attention was diverted by a flurry of activity to his left pansy and neville had just emerged from an alleyway several metres away from harry pansy had run straight into malfoy harry scowled as pansy smiled up at draco and batted her eyelashes some teammate harry muttered to himself apparently draco was not moved by pansy flirtatious behaviour he shoved her to the ground and cursed her on the spot neville shot a spell at draco which draco blocked harry moved forward slowly not wanting to draw attention to himself you think you can get me longbottom draco snarled sending a curse at neville harry watched proudly as neville blocked the spell easily and cast one in return draco laughed as he dodged neville spell too bad you ve got that potion in you longbottom i would love to send you straight to st mungo so you can be with your dear mommy and daddy neville did not respond to draco with words but with a flurry of spells and curses at last one of the spells connected leaving draco in a heap on the ground harry watched as neville stepped beside draco and glared down at him it too bad you drank the potion malfoy i d like to send you to your father bedside in azkaban you deserve to be there as much as him neville muttered quietly harry smiled as neville gaze met his harry was about to congratulate neville on a good fight when he felt the unmistakable jolt of a spell harry felt his body fall slowly to the ground you should have seen him lavender gushed he was brilliant once again the gryffindor students had gathered together on the floor in the common room to regale their tales of their battle training harry joined in this time proud of his fellow classmates harry nodded i agree with lavender neville kicked some serious butt tonight neville blushed deeply and grinned widely you guys are exaggerating lavender punched him lightly on the arm we are not you nearly took out all of my team first susan then padma and draco i couldntbelieve it when you got hermione neville smile faltered as he glanced at hermione sorry hermione i couldntlet you get away with taking down my team leader hermione smiled you got me fair and square neville no need to apologize ron shook his head i missed all the action thanks a lot harry harry grinned as he punched ron on the shoulder it not like you were going easy on me ron grinned well i guess i ll let hermione take the fame this time hermione snorted what fame is that ron sighed dramatically the fame of being the only wizard to take down the unbeatable harry potter of course hermione rolled her eyes and harry threw a cushion at ron head i cantbelieve i saying this seamus began but i cantwait to see malfoy tomorrow morning did you see him leave tonight he was so mad he couldntwalk straight was that before or after pansy slapped him for cursing her dean asked laughing they continued their laughter and their tales until hermione insisted that everyone go to bed harry sighed as he glanced at his watch he had not done any homework and he knew he would regret it tomorrow however harry so rarely had the opportunity to sit around and enjoy the company of his classmates surely one night of acting like a normal teenager could be allowed even for the boy who lived a n warning extreme fluff ahead honestly you may want to get a bucket in fact if you have any sort of aversion to fluff avoid this chapter completely i mean it consider yourself warned a n 2 i always thought hermione would be turning sixteen in book 6 until jkr proved me wrong on her website in the f a q s jo clearly states that hermione was nearly twelve when she started at hogwarts with her birthday being in september she would have turned twelve within the first few weeks at school therefore she ll be turning 17 in her sixth year i guess i ll take jo word on it hehe so here follows hermione seventeenth birthday chapter 20 hermione surprise the grayish hues of the early morning light fell across the grounds of hogwarts harry trainers were already soaked through from the dew on the grass he was jogging his usual path around the grounds looping around hagrid cottage along the lake around greenhouse two along the far side of the quidditch pitch and back up to the castle this morning found harry jogging the course alone except for the usual company of security officials they however kept their distance allowing harry the solitude he learned to appreciate at this time of day professor pandoran no longer joined harry every morning claiming that she could no longer keep up with him while harry had initially dreaded these early morning training sessions he now found himself looking forward to them all of his worries seemed to disappear as he took in the beauty of the hogwarts grounds he found solace in the early morning which served as a stark contrast to the remainder of his day harry nodded a farewell to the security officials as he climbed up the stairs to the castle he made his way to gryffindor tower hoping for a quick shower and an hour time to work on homework harry climbed through the portrait hole and made his way to the staircase leading to the boys dormitory morning harry harry stopped his hand on the banister and his foot frozen mid air over the bottom step he turned around and saw ron stretching on the couch in front of the fireplace what are you doing here harry asked crossing the room towards ron ron yawned widely before replying waiting for you harry raised an eyebrow as he plopped down into an armchair well he replied here i am ron surveyed harry i cantbelieve you willingly get up this early harry shrugged you get used to it ron paused and ran his fingers through his hair he took a deep breath have you thought of anything for hermione birthday harry swore silently to himself he had completely forgotten about his agreement to help ron plan something spectacular for hermione birthday harry shook his head and apologized sorry ron i haventeven thought about it ron nodded and stared at the empty fireplace i know you ve been busy harry frowned at ron have you come up with anything ron shrugged i have a few ideas but each one is as hopeless as the next harry leaned forward intrigued maybe not ron let hear them ron sighed and looked at harry skeptically promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone else promise ron glanced around the room and then leaned toward harry ron spoke quickly and quietly his face burning red the entire time harry eyes widened as he listened to ron deeply impressed wow ron i never knew you had it in you harry said leaning back in his chair i dontknow why you even asked for my help ron raked his fingers through his hair well while you have been justifiably busy i ve been thinking of nothing else besides i ll need help organizing it not to mention your moral support you ve got it mate harry replied he then furrowed his brows together i think we re going to need another person help though ron frowned who well neither you nor i can go into the girls dormitory harry began ron eyes widened not ginny harry said nodding his head ron groaned she ll tease me worse than fred and george would harry grinned well i guess i could ask parvati no ron interrupted let keep my humiliation within the family harry chuckled dontworry mate i have a feeling ginny will be all over this what am i going to be all over ron and harry jumped as ginny voice floated from the girls staircase impeccable timing miss weasley harry said cheerfully ginny raised an eyebrow at harry as she sleepily walked to the armchair opposite harry ugh harry just because you re teaching us doesntmean you have to sound like a professor she threw herself into the armchair swinging her legs to dangle over the arm why are you so cheerful anyway harry grinned i ll let your brother explain ron sighed and looked at ginny we re planning something for hermione birthday ginny raised her eyebrows what are you planning ron glanced at harry who nodded encouragingly well i g guess it more so me i mean i i planning something for hermione birthday ron stammered ginny swung her feet to the floor and leaned forward in her chair go on she said her curiosity evident i i i want to do something nice for her ron continued his face crimson in a whisper he added some something romantic ginny jaw dropped a wide grin spread across her face as she looked from ron to harry and back again did you say romantic ginny asked ron threw harry an i told you so look yes ginny ron said steely that what i said that fantastic ginny exclaimed ron head shot up to look at ginny in shock what ron asked disbelieving ginny rolled her eyes honestly ron it about time what can i do to help ron stared dubiously at his sister you re not going to say anything else you re not going to tease me mercilessly ginny grinned happily no i ll save the teasing and torment for when the two of you are finally dating so what the plan ron breathed a sigh of relief and then shared his idea by the time he was finished ginny mouth was hanging open and her eyes were wide oh ron she ll love it i cantbelieve you came up with that on your own ginny exclaimed ron slouched back into the sofa yeah but will it work harry and ginny looked at each other then replied in unison definitely harry ran into the common room early friday morning after his daily jog he had hoped the run would calm his nerves but he was far too anxious blimey you d think i was the one professing my love for hermione today harry scolded himself as he entered the common room he found ron pacing in front of the fireplace his face was pale and his hair was standing on end you all right mate harry asked as he crossed the common room ron shook his head i cantdo it i ve changed my mind ron said miserably harry shook his head you can and you will do it there too many people involved to back out now indeed in addition to ginny they had also enlisted the help of dobby and a surprisingly helpful professor mcgonagall ron opened his mouth to reply but then turned to the sound of footsteps on the girls staircase ginny bounded down the stairs smiling widely it done ron sank into the couch and put his head in his hands what have i done he muttered ginny sat beside her brother and rubbed his back consolingly it going to be fine ron besides you ve got to get your game face on or all of our plans will be for nothing ron ran his hands over his face and nodded right another scurry of footsteps on the girls staircase brought their conversation to a halt ron harry and ginny held their breath as hermione appeared at the bottom of the staircase she was clutching a bouquet of red roses in her arm and her face was flushed she stopped in her tracks as her eyes landed on her best friends the room fell silent as hermione surveyed her friends before her happy birthday hermione harry said attempting to eliminate the awkward silence that had fallen upon them he walked over and wrapped her in a hug careful not to crush the roses thanks harry hermione replied what are all of you doing down here so early we all wanted to be the first to wish our favourite girl a happy birthday ginny said smoothly hugging hermione tightly hermione grinned thanks ron stood and smiled awkwardly at hermione happy birthday mione he gave her a quick hug and then arched his eyebrows at the roses what with the roses he asked wow he good harry mused hermione face flushed they were lying on my pillow when i woke up she said smiling ron frowned who are they from harry bit the insides of his cheeks he really good hermione shrugged as her cheeks coloured i dontknow they just came with this she said holding out a small piece of parchment harry ginny and ron leaned in to read the parchment in a beautiful calligraphy were the words seventeen roses for each of your years harry frowned that awfully vague hermione shrugged i think it intriguing ron snorted hermione narrowed her eyes ronald just because you have the emotional depth of a rain puddle doesntmean that everyone else is limited to that level harry held his breath hermione going to regret that one he thought harry watched as ron took a deep breath what are you saying you ve got a secret admirer or something ron asked sharply hermione surveyed ron i not saying anything ronald but it is possible ron shrugged his shoulders and replied whatever you say hermione hermione frowned at ron and then turned to ginny come on ginny let go put these roses in some water ginny nodded and went to follow hermione up the stairs ginny turned to face ron and harry on the bottom step and gave them a thumbs up she then spun around and followed hermione up the stairs ron collapsed onto the couch how d i do harry grinned at his best friend brilliant absolutely perfect after a quick shower and more encouraging words for ron harry dragged ron downstairs to meet hermione and ginny in the great hall hermione was talking excitedly about the book harry and ron had given her as a present thank you both for the book hermione said smiling as ron and harry sat down across from her i sure it will help prepare me for my apparition test harry smiled you re welcome it was ron idea hermione raised her eyebrows at ron who had been staring blankly at his empty plate her eyebrows fell into a frown as she surveyed ron are you feeling all right ron hermione asked ron head shot up and his eyes darted to harry and ginny before they focused on hermione i fine why hermione frowned you haventeaten anything yet ron shrugged i not hungry hermione set her spoon down and clasped her hands in front of her on the table now i know something is wrong what is it harry nudged ron and handed him a plate of toast ron grabbed a couple slices and began munching absently i fine ron repeated hermione opened her mouth to voice her disbelief but was cut off by a long white box dropping onto the table in front of her she glanced up at the owls swarming overhead but could not discern which one had delivered it well arentyou going to open it ginny exclaimed excitedly hermione hand slowly removed the ribbon tied neatly around the box she lifted the lid to reveal six slender roses hermione slipped her hand into the box and retrieved a piece of parchment her cheeks flushed as she read the note aloud seventeen roses for each of your years six roses more for the years you ve been near ginny giggled this is getting interesting harry leaned forward and looked at the note curiously any name this time hermione shook her head who do you think they re from ginny asked hermione looked at her friends wide eyed i have no idea has she said anything ginny whispered harry glanced at hermione she had her new book getting there in one piece apparition at its simplest propped up in front of her lunch and was completely immersed in its pages ron sat beside her twiddling his spoon absentmindedly in his soup harry turned to ginny and whispered she not saying anything but i ve seen her rereading the notes under her desk in class her curiosity is definitely piqued ginny giggled softly and this afternoon all set harry whispered a large brown owl swooped down to the table in front of them and began nibbling the corner of hermione book after several seconds hermione finally noticed and snatched her book away the owl hopped over dropping two roses and a piece of parchment on her plate hermione eyes widened as she reached for the parchment she read the note silently clasping a hand over her mouth what is it ginny asked with a shaky hand hermione handed ginny the note harry and ginny read it together seventeen roses for each of your years six roses more for the years you ve been near two roses now since you ve entered my heart harry smiled as ginny handed the note to ron ron face flushed as he handed the note back to hermione it appears you have an admirer ron said thickly hermione stared at the note in her hand yes it appears so they finished their lunches taking guesses as to who hermione admirer might be neville seamus draco crabbe and goyle were contemplated as possible admirers much to the chagrin of hermione harry had caused ginny to choke on her pumpkin juice when he suggested that pansy parkinson might be a likely candidate since malfoy indiscretion in the training room hermione for her part cast harry an exasperated glare harry ron and hermione parted ways with ginny as they headed to their afternoon classes harry and ron continued to throw names around to hermione utter annoyance honestly you two are driving me mad i wish i had never shared this with you hermione hissed ron suddenly stopped dead in his tracks harry turned to face ron what is it mate ron slapped his hand to his forehead i ve forgotten my book bag in the great hall how could you forget your bag hermione scolded ron shrugged you guys go ahead i ll meet you there hurry ron mcgonagall doesnttake tardiness lightly hermione called as ron raced down the hallway harry and hermione walked into mcgonagall classroom and took their seats harry slid in beside parvati hesitantly she had been acting strangely lately she either attached herself to harry side and didntgive him room to breath or did little more than acknowledge him politely so far today had been the latter parvati glanced coolly at harry hello harry hey parvati harry said smiling have a good lunch yes not that you care she answered stiffly as she flipped through her transfiguration text harry sighed and shook his head he refused to get into a row with parvati today harry sat silently waiting for class to start he began doodling on the corner of his text harry hermione hissed harry looked up at hermione to see her twisted in her seat to face him what taking ron so long hermione whispered harry bit the insides of his cheeks and shrugged as mcgonagall entered the classroom the door slammed shut behind her as she strode to the front of the classroom hermione cast one last worried glance at the door before turning to face professor mcgonagall mcgonagall cleared her throat as she cast an appraising glance over the students good afternoon today we will be studying sorry professor ron exclaimed as he burst into the classroom mcgonagall shot ron a withering glare would you mind explaining why you are late mr weasley ron blushed as he sat down beside hermione i forgot my books professor mcgonagall peered over her glasses at him i dontappreciate being interrupted mr weasley now if you dontmind may i continue my lesson ron nodded of course professor mcgonagall raised an eyebrow at him and then continued as i was saying today we will be studying the theory of hey harry do you have an extra quill ron whispered loudly receiving glares from both hermione and mcgonagall mr weasley when you come to my class i expect you to be on time and to be prepared i should think your years thus far in my classroom would have made that clear sure thing professor ron replied offhandedly hermione mouth dropped open as she kicked ron under the table ouch whatcha kick me for ron exclaimed hermione buried her face in her hands as harry bit the insides of his cheeks so hard he thought he might be drawing blood mr weasley detention tonight mcgonagall exclaimed ron looked sheepishly at professor mcgonagall and nodded his head the remainder of the afternoon passed by incident free ron had even managed to get hermione to forget about his behaviour in transfiguration when he joked that harry might be her secret admirer ron hermione said shaking her head that like me saying that ginny fancies you ron screwed up his face yuk i take it back hermione laughed as they climbed through the portrait hole ginny bounded up to them her cheeks flushed hermione you ve got another owl hermione followed ginny to the couch in front of the fireplace to find an owl perched on the armchair hermione glanced at her friends and then untied the parchment tied to it she sat down and read the note her face turned red and her hand fluttered to her chest when she raised here eyes to her friends they were wide and shining brightly what did it say hermione ginny asked softly sitting beside hermione hermione handed ginny the note ginny glanced at ron and harry and then read aloud seventeen roses for each of your years six roses more for the

down ginny cheek as she looked briefly at ron she then turned to hermione and hugged her it beautiful harry glanced at ron who was watching hermione intently are you going ron asked quietly ginny and hermione broke apart hermione swiped her fingers across her cheeks what hermione asked ron swallowed and stared at her are you going ron repeated hermione glanced at the parchment and then looked up at ron i not sure i d like to find out who it is she said softly dontyou know ron asked his eyes boring into hers hermione blinked the tears from her eyes she stared at ron contemplatively she moved her gaze to the parchment in her hand no i dontthink i do she said quietly ron stared at hermione furtively before slouching in his seat and moving his gaze to the floor ron hermione ginny and harry sat quietly in front of the fireplace keeping their thoughts to themselves ron was becoming increasingly fidgety but only harry noticed it ron raked his fingers through his hair he suddenly jumped up and said i going to get cleaned up before mcgonagall detention i ll see you guys later ron wait hermione called standing up and reaching her hand towards ron harry watched ron shoulders rise and fall as he took a deep breath before turning to face hermione ron jaw clenched as he peered down at hermione yes he asked hermione fidgeted with the piece of parchment in her hand do you think i should meet this person she asked her eyes penetrating ron s ron took a step toward hermione put his hands on her shoulders and peered into her eyes he spoke softly his words clipped and forced i think you should go i i hope you re happy with what you find ron then turned abruptly and strode away from hermione and climbed up the stairs to the boys dormitory hermione stood staring at ron retreating back her mouth parted slightly hermione turned to face harry and ginny her forehead wrinkled in confusion and disappointment i guess i ll be going then she said quietly sinking into the couch beside ginny ginny patted hermione leg and smiled it ll all turn out right hermione i just know it hermione gazed at the empty staircase where ron had disappeared i not so sure ginny she then turned to the piece of parchment and re read it she turned abruptly to harry and ginny you two have to come with me what harry and ginny exclaimed hermione leaned forward and spoke urgently you have to come with me i dontknow who this person is it might not be safe ginny shook her head someone off their rocker cantwrite poetry like that she said nodding towards the parchment in hermione hand yes they can hermione insisted her eyes wide even if he not dangerous what if it someone that i really dontlike if you re there you can help me escape i dontthink the bloke was wanting you to bring anyone with you hermione harry said sagely that exactly why you need to come hermione insisted no harry said crossing his arms please hermione asked no ginny replied hermione folded her arms across her chest some friends you are she sniffed fine she continued i wontgo then harry and ginny bolted upright in their seats they had never considered that hermione might not go you have to go ginny insisted you have to at least solve the mystery i dontcare hermione said stiffly you do too harry said i saw your face when you read that poem you re dying to know who it is hermione squirmed in her seat i dontwant to get this person hopes up by meeting him only to turn him down once i there who says you re going to turn him down ginny inquired hermione sighed and rolled her eyes if i dontfancy him i not going to go out with him just because he went through all of this trouble for my birthday i not going to lie what if you do fancy him ginny pressed hermione glanced at the boys staircase i doubt i will harry leaned forward in his chair trying one last attempt you should go hermione you cantleave him waiting there all night at least have the courtesy to meet him even if it is only to turn him down hermione sighed and frowned at harry you re right she said i should go but only if you ll come with me harry groaned frustrated hermione where your gryffindor courage hermione shook her head primly this has nothing to do with courage ginny rolled her eyes give us a break hermione the poor guy would be so embarrassed if harry and i walked in with you hermione eyes darted between harry and ginny use harry invisibility cloak that way i ll know that you re there but he won t hermione harry began hold on ginny said holding her hand out to interrupt harry she turned to face him you have an invisibility cloak she whispered seemingly scandalized harry frowned at ginny yeah didntyou know ginny mouth dropped no i most certainly did not know how long have you had it harry shrugged nonchalantly since my first christmas at hogwarts it was my dad s ginny leaned back in her chair have you ever used it harry grinned loads of times a mischievous glint shone in ginny eyes how is it that i dontknow about this harry shrugged his shoulders and leaned back in his chair it not like we advertise that i have it but it has come in handy on numerous occasions as it will tonight hermione insisted nodding her head curtly ginny surveyed harry with a hint of a smile tugging at her lips you re just full of surprises potter harry smiled half heartedly yeah i an abyss of secrets ginny frowned at harry trying to determine what he meant by his comment hermione interrupted her thoughts so will you two come with me then hermione asked ginny met harry gaze and raised her eyebrows questioningly harry shrugged his shoulders and nodded fine we ll come ginny said turning to hermione with harry cloak at no time do we want our presence to be known hermione threw her arms around ginny thank you hermione exclaimed now come help me get ready ginny smiled as hermione tugged her arm i thought you were just going out of courtesy hermione shrugged that doesntmean i shouldntlook nice she said plainly she turned to harry meet us back here in an hour and bring your cloak harry saluted hermione with his hand to his forehead and replied yes ma am harry scribbled furiously across the parchment spread before him he had decided to work on his charms essay while ginny helped hermione get ready for her birthday surprise why girls always seemed to need help getting ready was beyond harry but it nevertheless gave him the opportunity to get a head start on his homework hermione would be so proud harry chuckled to himself as he proofread his notes after a few edits and additions harry smiled satisfied with his work what with the smile honey harry looked up to see parvati grinning at him he raised an eyebrow questioningly she had stayed clear of him all day and now she was calling him honey girls were so complicated harry shrugged and replied i just happy to be done flitwick essay parvati face spread into a wide smile as she slid into his lap and put her arms around his neck does that mean i can have you to myself tonight parvati purred in harry ear harry swallowed as he pulled parvati arms from around his neck i thought you were mad at me harry said pushing parvati back so he could look at her parvati pouted what made you think that parvati asked snaking her hands around harry neck again harry stared at her his mouth agape you barely acknowledged me all day parvati sighed and rolled her eyes you re so silly harry harry frowned feeling a ripple of anger flash through him are you saying you didntignore me all day harry parvati murmured as she leaned towards him for a kiss harry stopped parvati by placing his hands on her shoulders i want an answer parvati harry said sternly parvati eyes narrowed what your problem harry harry pushed parvati off his lap and began gathering his parchment and books that were spread on the table i refuse to play this game with you parvati harry said shoving his books roughly into his school bag please dontgo harry parvati pleaded harry spun around to retort but stopped himself when he met parvati teary eyes parvati please harry i sorry parvati began her bottom lip trembling i just harry are you ready to go harry turned to see hermione calling to him from the bottom of the girls staircase harry returned his gaze to parvati she was staring at hermione with narrowed eyes harry sighed i sorry parvati we ll have to finish this conversation later i ve got to help hermione with something parvati swallowed and moved her narrowed eyes to harry of course go help your friend your girlfriend will just have to wait parvati said coolly harry ran a hand through his hair dontdo that parvati parvati voice was sharp do what speak the truth harry felt anger flare up inside him again you re right parvati i helping one of my best friends on her birthday if that makes me an inconsiderate prat then so be it harry spat slinging his bag over his shoulder he turned and called to hermione i ll be right back hermione harry ran upstairs and threw his bag violently on his bed he kicked his trunk as the frustration from his conversation with parvati coursed through him trouble in paradise harry jumped and turned to face the voice that had come from the doorway ginny stood leaning against the doorframe with a small smile playing on her lips harry snorted i definitely not in paradise harry muttered raking his fingers through his untidy hair i can hex her if you want ginny replied drawing her wand from her robes harry chuckled despite himself no that okay i dontneed you to fight my battles ginny ginny surveyed harry seriously as long as you know that i will gladly hex anyone who hurts you harry harry swallowed hard as ginny words caused a tightening in harry chest he stared into ginny eyes and saw her honesty and determination i know ginny thank you ginny smiled softly as she tucked her wand away you should grab your cloak i sure hermione worn a hole in the carpet from her pacing by now harry nodded and leaned into his trunk to retrieve his invisibility cloak he folded it tightly and tucked it inside his robes he turned to face ginny shall we ginny nodded and smiled let go they met a very anxious hermione in the common room and rolled their eyes as hermione admonished them for taking so long relax hermione ginny said exasperated we still have plenty of time hermione wrung her hands nervously i dontwant to make a bad impression by being late harry chuckled by the sounds of that poem you dontneed to worry about the kind of impression you ll make hermione hermione straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin you can never be sure harry ginny stifled a giggle as harry rolled his eyes again they clambered through the portrait hole and began to make their way to the room of requirement i wonder if he a member of the d a hermione wondered aloud what makes you say that ginny asked glancing briefly at harry well other than the students in the d a it isntvery likely that anyone else knows about the room of requirement hermione stated you may be on to something hermione harry replied ginny shot harry a look of warning at which harry just grinned hermione sighed i just cantimagine who it could be and no i dontneed to hear any more suggestions harry harry chuckled and then turned to ginny well gin i think it time we go undercover harry said pulling the invisibility cloak from inside his robes he glanced up and down the hall before shaking the cloak to its full length harry then stepped toward ginny and threw the cloak around them i can still see your feet hermione said staring at the disembodied feet you ll have to get closer ginny harry whispered as he hunched over to let the bottom of the cloak touch the floor ginny turned her head and raised an eyebrow at harry are you trying to get fresh with me potter harry felt a flush creep into his cheeks he ignored the flips in his stomach as he retorted is that a request ginny laughed and elbowed harry in the ribs ouch harry yelped grinning sshh hermione scolded as she continued down the hallway with an invisible harry and ginny in tow harry and ginny stopped and watched as hermione walked by the tapestry of barnabas the barmy three times on her third pass a door appeared on the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry harry and ginny glanced at each other anxiously hermione looked up and down the hallway where are you two she whispered right behind you hermione jumped and then nodded okay follow me in i sure this wonttake long and then you can follow me out hermione hand reached hesitantly to the doorknob she paused her hand trembling inches from the door ginny reached through the folds of the invisibility cloak and nudged hermione in the back okay okay hermione hissed she straightened her shoulders and raised her chin as she pushed the door open hermione and ginny gasped as they walked into the room harry nudged ginny in warning as they followed hermione although he too felt his mouth drop open at the sight the room was nearly wall to wall with roses in the centre of the room was a small table with two place settings silver domes covered the feast that had been prepared among the candles on the table candles also hung suspended around the room casting a warm glow harry and ginny stood huddled together by the door as hermione stepped slowly towards the table ginny grabbed harry arm tightly as a slight movement in a darkened corner of the room caused hermione to jump a dark figure could be seen standing just beyond the dancing flicker of candlelight hermione turned to face the corner her hands twitching by her side the figure stepped forward slowly a tall red haired boy stepped into the candlelight clutching a single red rose in his hand the boy raised his eyes hesitantly to hermione and took another step towards her happy birthday hermione he said his voice cracking with emotion and fear hermione hands flew to her face harry and ginny held their breath both knowing they should turn around and leave but neither able to tear themselves away from the scene before them hermione shoulders shook as she took in a ragged breath ron she whispered ron walked forward closing the space between them your final rose as beautiful and perfect as you ron said softly holding the rose out to her hermione hand shook as she took the rose from ron she brought the flower to her nose and breathed in its sweet smell ron stood silently before her his face filled with anguish ron hermione said her voice breaking yes ron replied his voice low and strained hermione raised her eyes to ron i thought you had detention with professor mcgonagall ron cleared his throat no that was a set up so i could take off earlier and it wouldntlook suspicious professor mcgonagall knew about this hermione gasped ron raked his fingers through his hair nervously yeah she even taught me the method to transfigure these roses hermione mouth fell open you did all of this for me she whispered ron swallowed and nodded yes hermione i did it all for you hermione gaze swept around the room before landing on the rose in her hand she stared at the rose as a single tear rolled down her cheek ron i dontknow what to say hermione said softly ron hung his head and frowned at the floor it okay hermione i never dared to hope that you felt the same way about me but i couldntdeny it any longer i had to tell you i hope it doesntruin our friendship hermione shook her head that not what i meant ron hermione said she stepped closer to ron and tilted his chin up with her finger to raise his eyes to hers she held his gaze and whispered i wanted it to be you ron swallowed hard his eyes holding hermione s you did he asked throatily hermione nodded as she closed her eyes and sniffed the rose again she opened her eyes and looked at ron searchingly did you mean everything you said hermione asked softly ron nodded as he raised his hand to caress her cheek i meant every word hermione leaned her head into his hand will you keep your promise then hermione whispered ron frowned pardon hermione closed her eyes and recited so meet me tonight and i ll promise you bliss ron smiled and continued if you will only grant me love tender kiss hermione opened her eyes and stared up at ron i would grant you anything ron ron grinned and cocked an eyebrow at her anything he teased hermione smiled as she slipped her arms around ron neck well let see how this goes first ron swallowed nervously as he cupped hermione face in his hands he gazed into her eyes before leaning his head forward and capturing hermione lips with his own neither noticed the soft opening and closing of the door chapter 21 reading between the lines the weeks since hermione birthday had passed in a blur ron and hermione were officially a couple and even the taunts of draco malfoy could not bring them down all of gryffindor tower had sighed a collective it about time as the news spread only as it could in hogwarts harry had worried briefly how his friendship with ron and hermione may change now that they were together but other than putting up with their sappy glances and whispered teasing the trio friendships did not falter harry had never seen his two friends so happy and he wanted nothing more than for them to stay that way october had arrived with warm breezes and the vibrant colours that only autumn could bring the students enjoyed the lingering warmth of summer whenever they could by slipping outside between classes and at lunch the sun casting its healthy glow over them however the pleasant weather belied the state of the wizarding world beyond hogwarts as the attack on tonks and shacklebolt had indicated the second war had indeed begun harry ginny and ron sat in the great hall ignoring the breakfast dishes laid before them hanging on to every word as hermione read from the daily prophet ministry confirms death eater attacks the ministry of magic confirmed this morning that the attacks on three wizarding families in london were the work of the much feared death eaters marley mcgee jean and john jensen and emmanuel irmine were discovered in their homes by ministry officials after neighbours reported seeing the dark mark over the families houses as of yet no information has been uncovered to link these attacks cornelius fudge the minister of magic stated these attacks are random there is no reason for the general public to panic the ministry has the situation under control and the perpetrators of these crimes will be brought to justice while the nature of these crimes is unspeakable i call on all wizarding families to maintain their faith in the ministry and in myself funeral arrangements for the deceased will be announced in upcoming issues hermione scoffed as she threw down the newspaper in disgust maintain our faith in that useless waste of human flesh she muttered angrily i d rather eat flobberworms than put my trust in him harry ron and ginny stared morosely at the paper on the table in front of them none of them were shocked by hermione outburst they had become more and more frequent as reports of death eater attacks were splashed almost daily on the newspaper front page ginny shook her head i swear fudge looks more and more incompetent each day who does he think he is telling us not to worry about random attacks honestly i d feel better if the attacks were connected in some way then at least we d know who was in danger ron frowned we re all in danger ginny ginny matched her brother frown yeah i know they sat quietly taking in the new information while they were used to reading about attacks this was the first time there had been deaths since harry birthday harry glanced at his friends then said quietly i think fudge is lying i think these attacks are somehow connected and for some reason fudge feels that he needs to cover it up hermione knitted her eyebrows as she stared at harry what makes you say that harry harry shrugged well i not sure but fudge hates controversy if the link between the attacks is questionable it may show a weakness in the ministry fudge worries about nothing more than making sure he looks good ron snorted poor job at that ginny murmured in agreement while hermione studied harry she pulled the newspaper towards herself again and scanned the article a frown creased her forehead as she neared the bottom what is it hermione ron asked leaning over her shoulder to look at the paper hermione frowned and ran her finger over a line in the article this part of fudge statement seems out of place the nature of these crimes is unspeakable first he says that there no need to panic but then he mentions that the nature of the crimes is unspeakable why would he even mention the nature of the crimes if he trying to prevent panic ginny furrowed her brow it is odd it not very often that crimes are described as unspeakable maybe heinous or violent but not unspeakable this is fudge we re talking about ron commented it not like he the brightest torch in the dungeon harry studied ron thoughtfully ron harry began remember last year when well before when i first asked you about the department of mysteries ron frowned i think so why what did you say the people that worked there were called hermione ron and ginny answered together unspeakables they stared at each other in silence do you think the people attacked were unspeakables harry ginny whispered harry frowned it is a strange coincidence hermione nodded that would make sense fudge would definitely need to keep that quiet after what happened last spring in the department of mysteries the press would have a field day if the department was the target of death eater activity again ron stared at harry and asked quietly do you think you know who still after the prophecy harry swallowed hard the conversation had just taken a turn he did not want to follow voldemort knows that the prophecy was destroyed ron hermione replied but maybe there something else in there that he wants or someone ginny said quietly what do you mean hermione asked ginny glanced apprehensively at harry then replied well somebody must sort and label the prophecies in that room maybe voldemort is trying to track down the person that labeled harry prophecy in hopes of finding out the contents hermione eyes widened as she turned her gaze to harry harry maybe there still a way for you to find out about the prophecy yourself hermione said excitedly why would he want to do that ron asked so you know who will have another reason to come after harry but if harry knew what the prophecy said he would have the upper hand hermione argued harry sat quietly becoming more and more uncomfortable he knew he would eventually share the prophecy with his friends but the timing did not feel right he watched as hermione and ron bickered about him slightly amused that they continued their squabbles even after they had begun dating will you two please stop ginny said holding her hand on her forehead i canthandle your little love battles this early in the morning harry chuckled as hermione mouth open and closed unable to retort and ron ears burned red ginny glanced at harry and winked harry nodded a silent thank you in her direction ron recuperated quickly however and turned to ginny speaking of love where dean ginny rolled her eyes although unable to disguise the flush in her cheeks unlike the two of you we dontneed to spend every waking minute together ron cheeks flushed but he continued unfazed dontpeople generally want to spend time with their significant others ginny glared at ron i didntsay i didnt want to spend time with him i just said we dontfeel the need to spend all of our time together ron eyes narrowed as his train of thought shifted he not doing anything to hurt you is he ginny sighed no ron everything fine not every couple is like you and hermione look at harry i dontsee parvati anywhere harry felt his cheeks flush as he was thrown unwillingly into the centre of their argument harry flashed ginny a glare but felt his face soften as he met her apologetic eyes she was looking at him pleadingly her brown eyes round and her top teeth nibbling her lower lip harry sighed wondering silently how he could never stay mad at ginny as if on cue parvati and dean walked into the great hall along with seamus lavender and neville they were all talking excitedly as they sat down around the others did you guys see the notice board before you left the common room dean asked ron and harry they shook their heads it the first hogsmeade weekend parvati said smiling at harry as she took his hand in hers harry took in parvati hopeful gaze realizing that hogsmeade trips were basically the only opportunities for actual dates at hogwarts i reckon we should go together yeah harry asked parvati parvati smile widened as she squeezed harry hand of course she replied planting a quick kiss on his cheek i was hoping we could spend some time together alone harry forced a smile on his face hoping his discomfort wasntshowing through what did you have in mind harry asked parvati shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly i ll work it all out dontworry harry cocked his brow at her but then shrugged his shoulders okay then parvati glanced at lavender and then they each fell into a fit of giggles harry had given up trying to figure out the source of their behaviour long ago instead he turned his attention to ron what the plan for quidditch practice today captain harry asked ron face lit up as he dove excitedly into the plays he hoped to go over with the team harry listened attentively much preferring this conversation than to talks of prophecies or hogsmeade visits with giggling girls the worst thing about mondays was not the fact that they marked the beginning of a long work filled week or the fact that the professors all seemed to have met secretly and decided that mondays were the perfect days to load on the homework the worst thing about mondays could be simplified into two words as far as harry was concerned double potions harry dragged his feet as he trudged along with this fellow gryffindor sixth years to the dungeons their excitement from the hogsmeade notice had quickly been squelched by the piles of homework they had been given so far the school day ended with double potions and everyone knew their spirits would only be squashed further harry entered the potions classroom and threw his bag beside his desk and slouched into his chair parvati slid in beside him looking as though she felt as equally dejected as he did rough day harry said parvati sighed and nodded if it like this already in sixth year i cantimagine what next year will be like harry groaned i donteven want to think about it parvati nodded and patted harry knee well let not think on it then harry smiled and nodded agreed so do you want to get together tonight to get a start on some of this homework parvati asked harry ran his fingers through his hair well it monday so that means quidditch practice and battle training parvati finished she stared at the desk top sorry i wasntthinking harry studied parvati things had improved slightly since their argument on hermione birthday they had talked the next day and parvati had told harry that she was sorry for the way she had been acting but that all she wanted was some attention harry had apologized for his busy schedule but also stated that ron and hermione were very important to him and he would always do whatever he could to help them harry and parvati had both agreed to be more understanding and they had been true to their words want to come watch quidditch practice harry asked parvati shook her head lavender and i are going to visit professor trelawney it been ages since we ve seen her and i d hate to cancel harry nodded his head while inwardly grimacing he wasntsure what to think about professor trelawney anymore he had sided with hermione for the majority of his years at hogwarts believing trelawney to be a fraud but knowing that trelawney had been the messenger of the prophecy concerning his fate with voldemort he no longer knew what to think either way trelawney always made him uncomfortable i ll see you tonight then harry said squeezing her hand that was still resting on his knee parvati smiled weakly after your training potter patil please keep you hands to yourself snape snarled as he strode to the front of the classroom harry felt his cheeks burn as he let go of parvati hand and glared at snape malfoy could be heard sniggering at the front of the classroom and while i ve got your attention potter snape sneered down his long nose i ve just come from the headmaster office he asked me to inform you that you will not be attending hogsmeade this weekend what harry blurted his eyes popping open manners potter snape chastised silkily sorry professor harry said fighting to keep his voice steady did you just say that i not allowed to go to hogsmeade sir snape smirked i always knew you were more dense than a cauldron bottom potter but do you honestly need me to repeat myself in front of the entire class harry felt anger rush through him as he quickly glanced around the classroom all eyes were on him entranced by yet another feud between harry and snape harry eyes landed on malfoy harry had expected to see a smirk on malfoy face but instead saw a look of interest and contemplation harry eyes snapped back to snape did professor dumbledore say why sir harry asked between his clenched teeth snape glared at harry and snapped i am simply relaying the message potter i do not presume to question the headmaster or his decisions i refuse to waste any more of my class time discussing your pathetic social circumstances harry clenched his fists on the top of his desk as snape began to drone on about today lesson he was furious that his hogsmeade privileges had been revoked and even more furious that snape had made such a public display of it harry silent fumings were interrupted by the scraping of chairs around him harry glanced at the blackboard and saw snape written instructions flash across it parvati lifted her cauldron onto her desk and turned to harry do you think snape was serious she whispered harry nodded yeah i think so harry walked to the front of the classroom to pick up his ingredients malfoy stepped in front of him blocking his way shove off malfoy harry growled malfoy smirked and spoke to harry his voice uncharacteristically quiet precious potter not going to hogsmeade dumbledore keeping his prized boy in the castle how very interesting harry heart pounded in his chest something in malfoy tone and demeanor was very unsettling for harry almost as though malfoy knew something that harry didn t harry resorted to their usual banter how dear old dad malfoy rather than scowling malfoy smiled broadly he doing quite well potter draco continued his voice low he raised an eyebrow as he continued it was just last night that he was telling me how azkaban been such a freeing experience for him harry heart stopped as he stared at malfoy smirking face harry turned on his heel and walked straight to ron i need a skiving snackbox harry hissed in ron ear ron looked at harry concerned what is it mate harry shook his head not now have you got any on you ron nodded and reached into his pocket he slipped a small two piece candy into harry hand you carry those around with you hermione hissed from behind ron ron turned around i ve started to yeah hermione looked scandalized you re a prefect she hissed ron shrugged and grinned at her sheepishly causing her to flush you re incorrigible she muttered as a smile crinkled the corner of her lips thanks ron harry said as he strode back to the front of the class towards the ingredients again harry popped one half of the candy into his mouth ron hadntsaid which kind it was but harry was pretty sure he recognized the colour harry ignored malfoy sniggering as he passed malfoy desk harry took his time picking up his ingredients he began to feel a burning at the back of his throat and knew he had been right he had just taken a puking pastille harry loaded the ingredients into his arms and began his journey back to his desk to harry delight malfoy decided to block harry path again watch where you re going potty i d hate for you to drop anything malfoy sneered elbowing harry in the arm in an attempt to jostle the pile of ingredients stacked precariously in harry arms the elbow was perfectly timed as far as harry was concerned for in the next second harry vomited spectacularly over malfoy robes argh malfoy exclaimed as he stared down in disgust at his spoiled robes harry would have laughed out loud if he hadntfelt the continued tossing of bile in his stomach malfoy face was flushed in anger as his eyes glinted dangerously at harry you ll pay potter malfoy snapped shoving harry away from him the ingredients in harry arms crashed to the floor as harry stumbled into malfoy desk as harry hands grabbed the edge of the desk to stabilize himself he vomited in a perfect arc directly into malfoy cauldron malfoy potion was ruined professor malfoy cried his voice high and shrill potter ruined my potion snape swept over to malfoy desk and looked down his long nose at the mess on malfoy robes and then peered into malfoy cauldron explain yourself potter snape spat harry opened his mouth to speak but immediately snapped it shut neither fred nor george had ever said how truly sick the puking pastilles made you feel the other half of the candy was in harry pocket but he could hardly take it with malfoy and snape examining his every move harry eyes burned as he willed himself not to puke again he was unsuccessful he puked all over the top of malfoy desk ruining malfoy remaining ingredient scrolls of parchment and silver plated quill professor malfoy cried snape eyed harry curiously through narrowed eyes get out of my classroom potter harry nodded and rushed out of the classroom hearing malfoy protesting behind him harry rushed down the corridor slightly amazed that he got away so easily he distanced himself from snape dungeon before popping the other half of the candy into his mouth the burning at the back of his throat and twisting of his stomach came to an abrupt stop harry marveled at the genius that was fred and george harry raced down the corridors towards dumbledore office he stopped in front of the stone gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the headmaster office puking pastilles harry said hesitantly hoping dumbledore hadntchanged the password since the start of the school year apparently he had the gargoyle remained unmoved the irony would have been too much anyway fizzing whizbees chocolate frogs sherbet lemon sugar quills laughing lollies strawberry popps the gargoyle was motionless appearing to stare at harry haughtily harry racked his brain frantically harry cocked his head as an idea struck him the twins had provided inspiration earlier fainting fancies rampaging rashes the gargoyle sprang aside revealing the spiraling staircase to dumbledore office harry rushed forward and tapped his fingers impatiently on the handrail as the staircase spiraled slowly upwards harry jumped up the final steps and knocked soundly on the large oak door the door swung open to reveal a very grim looking professor mcgonagall beyond her harry could see dumbledore seated at his desk dumbledore sighed harry if this has to do with your hogsmeade trip i certain our discussion can wait until after your potions class harry stepped into the office shaking his head no professor this has to do with lucius malfoy getting out of azkaban dumbledore eyes darted briefly to professor mcgonagall before returning to harry have a seat harry dumbledore replied tiredly harry stepped forward ignoring the chair that dumbledore had indicated so it true then harry said quietly feeling a churning in his stomach that had nothing to do with skiving snackboxes please harry sit down dumbledore insisted harry obliged sitting on the edgeof the seat mcgonagall sat in the seat beside him what have you heard harry dumbledore inquired his eyes piercing harry s harry ran his fingers through his hair it was something draco said to me dumbledore leaned forward in his chair what did mr malfoy say harry scowled we were having one of our er discussions and i asked him how his dad was doing he said his dad was doing well and how last night his dad had been telling him how azkaban had been a freeing experience the way he said it i just felt something was wrong dumbledore nodded his eyes continuing to pierce harry s draco said he spoke to his father last night harry nodded dumbledore looked at mcgonagall minerva of course albus i ll get right on it mcgonagall replied standing up swiftly and exiting dumbledore office dumbledore steepled his fingers in front of him as he peered at harry over his half moon spectacles are they all out professor harry asked quietly dumbledore nodded gravely i afraid so harry azkaban is completely empty harry swallowed hard so then all the death eaters you captured last year in the department of mysteries they re all harry felt his throat constrict as the idea overwhelmed him yes they have all escaped they are all out there dumbledore said solemnly waving his hand toward the world that lay outside hogwarts harry felt sick not only had the war begun but voldemort had managed to get all of his supporters back in his ranks that why i cantgo to hogsmeade then harry said dully his earlier anger seeming so frivolous in light of this more recent news yes harry and i apologize for the nature of snape message i thought it best for your confinement to the castle to be public knowledge so that the news will travel from what you ve just told me i am certain that the news will reach the death eaters themselves the trip to hogsmeade will be safer for the other students if the temptation of capturing you is not there harry scowled i glad to help he said sarcastically dumbledore sighed deeply it is unfair harry you have every right to feel cheated harry slouched in his chair i feel used they sat in strained silence harry was tired of being used in one way or another to direct or in this case misdirect death eater activities he was tired of his life being altered to protect the fun and enjoyment of others he was tired of being forced to sit quietly like a good boy while the grown ups all around him decided the best way for him to live his life until they thought it was time for him to save their lives he was tired of it all perhaps it would be best for you to return to your potions class harry dumbledore said quietly harry raised his eyes to dumbledore the old man sat behind his desk staring solemnly at harry harry did not feel anger towards the man as he thought he might rather he felt frustration and disappointment of course professor harry rose and walked slowly to the door i sorry harry harry paused and turned to look at his headmaster and mentor he nodded at dumbledore and replied i know he turned on his heel and left dumbledore office with a heavy heart and a clouded mind chapter 22 conversations harry stepped off the revolving staircase leading from dumbledore office wearily his mind was plagued with the information he had just received from dumbledore harry had hoped his instincts about draco behaviour were wrong unfortunately they were bang on draco had hinted at his father freedom it was strange how obvious draco had been really that realization did nothing to calm harry nerves harry feet carried him through the castle and outside even as dumbledore had suggested harry return to class harry knew there was no way he was going back to snape class harry had been gone too long to be able to catch up on his potion snape would not hesitate to give harry a zero so what was the point in putting himself through the torture of sitting through the remainder of class harry knew he could very well be facing detention but at this point he could care less there were much bigger things to worry about harry walked around the lake to the secluded area he had found last year after the department of mysteries fiasco where he had sat and mourned the loss of sirius harry threw himself on the ground and drew his knees into his chest he stared morosely across the lake voldemort had his army back azkaban was empty as bad as things had been since the attack on tonks and shacklebolt they were about to get a lot worse harry knew daily attacks and most likely murders were inevitable and he was the only one who could stop them for good bloody prophecy either must die at the hand of the other harry groaned as he pressed his forehead into his bent knees harry squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to force his thoughts of the prophecy from his mind there was no use mulling about it he had the bloody thing memorized he had spent hours days months analyzing it and came to the same conclusion each time he was the only one who could end this war once and for all he was the boy who lived the one the only one who could vanquish the dark lord with voldemort alive and well the war would rage on yes it was all up to him the famous harry potter brilliant harry sighed and raised his head to rest his chin on his knees once again a soft wind rippled the surface of the lake causing the water to reflect a distorted abstract version of the fall scenery around him harry eyes glazed over as he allowed the image to blur further he lost himself in his thoughts and only broke from his reverie some time later upon hearing voices coming to him from the other side of the lake harry brought his eyes back into focus and surveyed the grounds leading to the castle students were spilling out the doors signaling the end of another school day harry watched the students from a distance envious of their laughter and of their ignorance where have you been harry hermione interrogated as harry climbed through the portrait hole outside harry said blandly walking past hermione and heading for the boys staircase oh no you don t harry hermione scolded grabbing harry arm you have some explaining to do harry sighed and turned to look at hermione ron had stepped up behind her and was giving harry the same no nonsense look harry scanned the common room and returned his gaze to his best friends not here harry replied and then turned to climb the staircase hermione and ron followed harry up the stairs and into the sixth year boys dorm room harry was relieved to find the dormitory empty he sat on his bed leaning against the headboard and resting his arms on his bent knees ron and hermione each sat cross legged at the foot of his bed looking at him expectantly what is it mate ron asked his brow furrowed in concern is it your scar hermione asked her voice low harry shook his head he opened his mouth to reply but was cut short there you are ginny exclaimed as she burst into the room i overheard parvati and lavender talking about you leaving potions and not coming back harry what happened ron scowled ginny you cantjust come barging into the boys dormitory we could have been changing or something ginny rolled her eyes i have six older brothers ron since you re one of them you should know i wouldntfind anything here that i haventseen at home but ron began come sit down ginny hermione interrupted casting ron an exasperated look harry was just about to tell us what happened ginny smiled gratefully at hermione and then sent a glare at ron before plopping herself beside harry she turned to harry with concerned eyes go on harry harry nodded and swallowed he wasntsure how to start he took a deep breath they ve escaped all of them azkaban empty the silence in the room was deafening hermione ron and ginny stared at harry their mouths gaping open and their eyes wide in disbelief the death eaters ron choked out harry nodded how can that be hermione questioned i thought the security at azkaban had been enhanced harry shrugged his shoulders dumbledore didntsay how you talked to dumbledore ginny asked harry nodded he explained what malfoy had said during class and how he got such a bad feeling from malfoy tone he then relayed everything dumbledore had said well that explains why mcgonagall pulled snape and malfoy out of class hermione replied she did harry asked his eyebrows raised ron nodded yeah pandoran supervised the rest of the class i wonder what snape has to do with it harry pondered aloud i imagine mcgonagall wanted snape involved in questioning draco hermione surmised draco would think he had an ally harry nodded as he stared at his quilt so is this why you cantgo to hogsmeade ron asked harry nodded again you cantgo to hogsmeade ginny asked harry glanced at ginny no snape announced in front of the entire class that dumbledore wasntallowing me to go slimy git ginny muttered we ll stay and keep you company harry hermione said patting his knee harry shook his head no way i d feel worse if you guys stayed behind besides who else am i going to get to refill my stash of sweets and dungbombs but harry ron began no harry stated emphatically you guys go and enjoy yourselves i ll be doing homework all day anyway end of discussion ron hermione and ginny glanced at each other before nodding in agreement knowing it would be useless to argue with harry come on harry said pushing himself off his bed we ve got practice right you are mate ron said jumping off harry bed and a great practice it will be i ve got all the new plays worked out and i think ginny and dennis are going to be brilliant with a little practice first we ll need to harry shook his head and smiled as ron ranted all the way out to the quidditch pitch harry wished he could forget about the disturbing news as easily as ron of course ron didnthave a bloody prophecy to worry about nor was ron one to brood no that was harry specialty harry felt a scowl cross his face as the image of malfoy smug look flashed across harry mind harry lost himself in thoughts of lucius malfoy and the other death eaters that had in all certainty returned to voldemort the enemy had been fortified and harry had been grounded harry was brought back to his senses as he felt a small hand slip into his he looked down and saw ginny staring up at him with concern etched on her face she squeezed harry hand all right harry she asked quietly harry swallowed the huge lump that had formed in his throat yeah yeah i ll be fine she squeezed harry hand again before releasing it good because i quite taken with my new chaser position and i d hate to have to revert to playing seeker again harry smiled there will be no need for that weasley ginny grinned causing an odd fluttering in harry chest afraid of being shown up potter ginny teased is that a challenge harry asked raising an eyebrow you better believe it ginny replied with a mischievous glint in her eyes name the time and place weasley you re on harry said ginny tilted her head and raised her eyes to the sky in thought i ll get back to you harry chuckled you re not going to back out are you ginny cocked an eyebrow never you wontknow what hit you potter harry grinned as ginny turned on her heel and walked into to girls dressing room harry shook his head as he entered the boys dressing room feeling as though he had already been hit by something he couldntquite identify harry pushed his glasses up to his forehead and ground his knuckles into his tired eyes he sat at a table in the gryffindor common room surrounded by various textbooks and rolls of parchment after a vigorous quidditch practice that had run late harry had skipped supper and gone to his training with pandoran harry although already tired from quidditch practice had trained hard pandoran had taught him a few new defensive spells that were rather complicated and harry had to focus all of his concentration and energy on getting the spells right after an hour of intense work pandoran had excused harry early stating that he had better get some rest or everything they were working on would be in vain harry had nodded and left without another word and walked straight to gryffindor tower he knew he had several hours of homework to do before he could get any of the rest that pandoran had prescribed harry removed his knuckles from his eyes and pushed his glasses back in place he had got quite a bit accomplished already but the essay he was currently writing for mcgonagall was doing him in the theory was very intricate and the incantations were difficult his brain felt overloaded overworked and overtired he couldnteven beg hermione for help since she and ron had prefect duties for the rest of the night harry sighed and returned to his work hi harry harry looked up from his notes to see parvati standing beside him hi harry said warily trying to gauge her mood he definitely did not have the energy for a row how was your visit with trelawney parvati eyes brightened as she sat in the chair beside harry it was great lavender and i practiced reading tea leaves harry nodded absently as memories of trelawney reading his tea leaves in third year came flooding into his mind trelawney had seen the grim in harry cup and in trelawney style had exclaimed in horror his impending death harry shook his head at the memory harry just because you cantappreciate the art of divination doesntmean you can belittle my interest in it parvati snapped harry jaw dropped as his forehead wrinkled in confusion pardon he asked parvati sighed you do nothing to support my interests harry you expect me to come watch your quidditch practice but all you do when i try to share something that important to me is smirk and shake your head harry sighed i wasntbelittling your interests parvati i was just thinking about whatever harry forget it parvati said slouching in her chair and rolling her eyes harry stared at parvati why was everything so complicated with her parvati nodded towards the pile of parchment in front of harry how much work do you have left to do harry glanced at the mess of books around him i ve got to finish mcgonagall essay parvati raised an eyebrow that not due until the end of the week harry nodded yeah but i know snape will load extra work on me tomorrow after having missed a double class today parvati narrowed her eyes at harry i was surprised when you didntcome back to class what happened harry fiddled with the corner of his transfiguration text i went to see dumbledore parvati leaned forward did you talk to him about hogsmeade harry glanced at parvati before returning his gaze to the frayed corner of his textbook yeah that came up so are you allowed to go parvati asked eagerly no harry said quietly parvati sighed oh come on harry i sure you can change dumbledore mind why cantyou go anyway it not safe for me harry said awkwardly he had never been comfortable talking about this part of his life with parvati why wouldntit be safe parvati asked her nose wrinkled harry fingered the edge of his text dumbledore worried that voldemort may send death eaters after me parvati rolled her eyes oh give me a break i sure the death eaters have better things to do than go after a hogwarts student in hogsmeade harry turned his gaze to parvati she had no idea she was completely clueless she had only heard rumours of his past experiences with voldemort and his death eaters harry had never taken the time to work through the fact and fiction of the rumours with her parvati had no idea how intertwined the death eater activities were with harry life harry couldntreally blame her for her ignorance he had never offered to share the truth with her in all honesty he hadntwanted her to know he now realized that part of the reason he liked spending time with parvati was the fact that there was nothing about her that reminded him of voldemort or the prophecy that had never been part of her life she had provided a distraction from the thoughts that often haunted harry mind harry was now beginning to question how fair that was to either of them how long could he pretend to ignore the prophecy and destiny that dictated his life harry remained silent why dontyou sneak out parvati asked harry shook his head no that not a good idea parvati sighed harry i know in past years you ve snuck out of gryffindor tower to do all sorts of things why not sneak into hogsmeade harry shook his head no parvati parvati slouched in her chair again i suppose you expect me to stay her too then harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair no i dontexpect you to stay here well dontyou want me to stay here with you parvati asked sulkily harry groaned he could never win with her she always seemed to put him on the defensive and he was getting tired of it harry turned in his chair and looked at parvati directly this isntworking parvati parvati sat up straight what isntworking us harry replied harry watched as the colour drained from parvati face her chin trembled as she asked what are you saying harry harry took a deep breath i dontthink i can be what you need me to be parvati i too busy we never see each other and when we do we always seem to argue i tired i donthave the strength for this anymore parvati blinked rapidly fighting against the tears welling in her eyes you re breaking up with me harry took a deep breath and nodded yes parvati i am parvati fingers swept quickly over the tears that escaped from her eyes she took a deep breath and replied you re right harry i do need more than you can give me besides i ve come to realize that you will never look at me the way you look at ginny harry breath caught in his throat as his brows furrowed together what he asked hoarsely parvati smiled and shook her head honestly harry you really need to stop denying that you have feelings for her harry felt outraged i have no idea what you re talking about parvati ginny and i are friends parvati smirked and rolled her eyes right harry pressed his lips together and felt his nostrils flare as he glared at parvati parvati chuckled and wiped another stray tear off her cheek she looked across the common room to where ginny was sitting with several fifth year students harry followed parvati gaze and looked at ginny he noticed how the light from the torches danced on her hair making it look like it was a source of fire itself ginny must have sensed harry gaze for she looked up and locked her eyes with his she flashed harry a smile causing a flurry of cartwheels to erupt in his stomach harry felt his face soften as a smile crinkled the corners of his mouth ginny turned back to her friends leaving harry staring at her from across the room am i wrong parvati asked quietly harry eyes darted back to parvati she was smiling sadly but amusedly as well harry eyes glanced to ginny briefly before he focused on parvati again harry opened his mouth to argue but parvati held up her hand to stop him dontsay anything harry i imagine the situation is more complicated than i realize i do hope that the two of you can work it out though i know she not happy with dean harry perked up she not parvati smirked i thought you were her friend harry dont you know harry frowned and looked over to ginny again he noticed her dart a glance his way harry felt parvati hand on his knee he turned his head to look at her good luck harry parvati said then rose from her seat and walked across the common room and up the stairs to the girls dormitory harry sat in confused silence his now ex girlfriend just wished him luck on getting together with his best friend harry shook his head and marked that conversation as the strangest one he d ever had in his life and that was saying a lot harry closed his eyes and sighed he cleared his mind and returned to his transfiguration essay he set to work oblivious to the common room emptying around him he pored over his texts and scribbled furiously across several sheets of parchment paper he had gone through half of his inkbottle already and showed no signs of stopping think you might come up for air harry harry looked up and met the chocolate brown eyes of one ginny weasley huh harry muttered slightly thrown as parvati accusation flitted through his mind ginny chuckled as she sat in the chair that parvati had vacated earlier in the evening dontyou think you ve worked long enough harry stretched his arms out in front of him what time is it nearly eleven harry eyes widened guess i lost track of time ginny raised an eyebrow so it would seem harry studied ginny face her dark eyes were sparkling at him as a smile twitched at the corner of her lips harry found himself staring at her lips wondering if they felt as soft as they looked harry tore his eyes away his heart pounding against his ribcage merlin was parvati right you all right harry ginny asked her voice filled with concern harry swallowed hard somewhat amazed at the huge lump that had formed in his throat harry ran his fingers nervously through his hair yeah yeah i just tired ginny placed her hand lightly on harry arm sending a jolt of electricity through harry body you need to get your rest harry ginny said concerned harry nodded frowning at the strange sensations he was having pandoran said the same thing ginny smiled you should listen to us harry harry shrugged i suppose ginny squeezed his arm come on i ll help you clean up harry nodded and began gathering his textbooks as ginny gathered rolls of parchment ginny glanced at harry from the corner of her eye i surprised parvati didntstick around to help you harry shoved his textbooks into his school bag i dontreckon she ll be helping me much any more ginny reached for a piece of parchment that had slid to the opposite side of the table why not we broke up harry said simply ginny movements stilled as though someone had hit her with a spell she eventually straightened and turned to face harry you broke up harry nodded noticing that ginny voice seemed higher pitched than usual yeah it for the best ginny surveyed harry and then wrinkled her nose i never did much like her with you harry raised an eyebrow oh no ginny shook her head nah you need a girl who doesntneed to be coddled she was too high maintenance harry sighed you re right she was ginny grinned and pushed the rolls of parchment she had gathered into harry arms well potter you ll have all the girls throwing themselves at you once word gets out that you re available again harry blushed i doubt that ginny ginny raised an eyebrow i ll bet you five galleons that some girl will throw herself at you by lunch time tomorrow harry surveyed ginny she was smirking at him daring him to accept her wager he smiled and held out his hand for her to shake you re on it became very apparent that ginny knew the girls of hogwarts much better than harry did harry hadnteven managed to finish his bowl of porridge the next morning before girl after girl approached him some under the guise of needing tutoring others being much more blunt by slipping him notes asking him to meet them in specified broom cupboard at specified time ginny meanwhile was grinning widely at him from across the table i do hope you can pay me before the weekend harry i would love a little extra spending money in hogsmeade ginny said coyly harry groaned as another girl slipped him a note you ll get your money ginny dontworry harry muttered i dontunderstand why the sudden interest hermione leaned towards harry and smiled sympathetically it the battle training harry girls get all hot and bothered watching you train harry choked on his pumpkin juice what ginny nodded it true harry i ve seen the way girls look at you when you re explaining a spell or demonstrating a new technique they re practically drooling harry looked offended they do not ginny and hermione rolled their eyes ron leaned towards harry and sighed it true mate i ve seen it myself harry glanced at his friends who were regarding him with amusement he shook his head i dontbelieve it ron snorted oh believe it harry you re practically another gilderoy lockhart harry put his face in his hands i am not like lockhart harry heard giggling behind him and turned around in his seat two fifth year girls from hufflepuff were standing and whispering behind him when they noticed he was looking at them they shrieked and then ran giggling from the great hall harry moaned and buried his face in his hands how do i make this stop ginny smirked that easy harry get yourself another girlfriend harry stared at ginny with his mouth hanging open he swallowed hard and muttered right harry was quite sure that wouldntbe happening any time soon chapter 23 some won some lost harry crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow at the witch standing in front of him state your terms he said the red haired witch grinned at him slyly simple potter she began mimicking harry stance by crossing her arms across her chest a simple game of catch the snitch loser has to cook supper for the winner harry stared hard at ginny as she stood her ground daring him to accept he was quite confident that he could win this game he would never deny ginny exceptional ability at quidditch but her skills really helped her as chaser not so much as seeker of course harry also had the fastest broom at hogwarts harry cocked his head to one side in thought what will the loser cook ginny smiled her eyes sparkling winner choice harry raised an eyebrow really ginny nodded never wavering her eye contact with harry harry smiled i hope you know how to cook steak weasley ginny narrowed her eyes at harry so you accept the terms then harry held his hand out to her agreed ginny slipped her small hand into harry and shook it to seal the deal it was friday night and ginny had not forgotten about the challenge that surfaced before quidditch practice on monday night of course harry could really care less about the challenge itself after another grueling week including hours of extra work from snape harry did not need an excuse to hit the quidditch pitch for some flying he longed for the release that flying always gave him the fact that he d be flying with a certain red haired witch made no difference whatsoever or so he told himself harry watched ginny as she opened the quidditch supplies case to retrieve a practice snitch parvati accusation earlier in the week that harry had romantic feelings for ginny had harry reeling although harry had thought his mind would be free from frivolous thoughts about girls after he had broken it off with parvati he found he was thinking even more on the subject about one girl in particular if he was being completely honest with himself he was completely flabbergasted by parvati allegation it was completely absurd he told himself ginny was the one who had a crush on him or at least she used to it was true they had grown closer over the summer but they had simply gone from being acquaintances to being best friends to outsiders harry reasoned their close friendship may appear as something more especially when compared to previous years but the facts were simple harry and ginny were friends that was it end of story so why did his heart race and his face flush every time she was near harry hadntquite figured that one out yet but he was determined to do so tonight you ready to eat my dust potter harry blinked and shook his head as ginny voice penetrated his thoughts he moved his eyes to meet hers and felt his heart beat rapidly she held the snitch in one hand and her broom in the other one of her eyebrows was raised in question and her eyes were sparkling with amusement harry smirked at ginny the only thing i ll be eating is a thick juicy steak ginny grinned we ll see about that she let the snitch go and they watched as it zoomed around them and then flew high above them and disappeared ginny and harry faced each other and straddled their brooms ginny stared hard at harry on the count of three one two three they both kicked hard off the ground and went soaring into the sky harry flew several laps around the pitch not even looking for the snitch he glanced around and saw ginny doing much of the same he made several dives and loops feeling the exhilaration from the stunts he saw ginny hovering a few feet above him shaking her head and grinning at him are you trying to impress me potter ginny called teasingly harry pulled up and hovered in front of her he grinned at her i dontknow am i ginny laughed and rolled her eyes why would you need to impress me harry harry heart thudded against his ribcage as he took in ginny flushed cheeks and teasing grin why would he need to impress her does one usually need to impress friends harry didntthink so harry swallowed and shook his head i just trying to intimidate you with my flawless skills and abilities ginny snorted harry grinned as ginny surveyed him thoughtfully he saw her eyes dart to the side and then return to his you re awfully conceited for someone that about to lose harry cocked an eyebrow at her and was about to retort when ginny suddenly darted to his left with a burst of speed harry quickly turned around and swore under his breath as he saw ginny racing after the snitch harry pressed himself against his broom as he chased after ginny she had a good head start the cool evening air rushed against harry causing his eyes to water as he accelerated toward the ground he was gaining on ginny the snitch suddenly darted to the left and then up harry was now at the advantage as ginny had to pull her broom up against her fast descent the snitch began to zigzag across the pitch and harry and ginny were now side by side harry chanced a glance at ginny her eyes were narrowed and a look of sheer determination was spread across her face he almost felt like letting her win almost harry turned his attention back to the snitch they were within a few metres harry pressed his body low and burst ahead of ginny he reached his hand forward and easily captured the snitch harry turned his broom sharply to face ginny and flaunt his victory unfortunately she was much closer than harry had realized and his abrupt stop had not been anticipated ginny crashed into him knocking them both off their brooms and tossing them to the ground below harry felt the air push forcefully out of his lungs as he landed flat on his back he struggled to breathe in his eyes tightly closed as the pain of his body crashing into the hard earth shot through him the sound of ragged breathing beside him brought harry back to his senses his eyes shot open and he rolled to his side ginny was lying face down and not moving harry heart pounded as he pushed himself to his knees and crawled over to ginny he could see her back rise and fall in sharp uneven movements are you okay gin harry asked resting his hand on her shoulder ginny nodded her head against the ground just catching my breath ginny rasped harry nodded as he struggled to regain his own ability to breathe properly he felt the snitch struggle against his still clenched fist harry allowed his body to fall to the ground beside ginny his hands resting on his chest as he took in deep heavy breaths i suppose you re going to use this as an excuse to get out of cooking me supper harry said ginny turned her head to look at harry her eyes glinting mischievously would it work harry chuckled as he turned his head to look at her no ginny put on her best pout harry found himself staring at her and began imagining ways to wipe that pout from her lips preferably with his own harry turned his head abruptly and stared at the sky above him his heart pounded noisily in his chest what was going on harry pressed his eyes shut as his mind began a slide show in his head ginny hesitant smile as he opened his gift from her on his birthday ginny eyes flashing with excitement after her first roller coaster ride ginny cheeks flushed with anger after slapping harry hard across the face ginny eyes red and puffy after sharing her story of the chamber of secrets with mr brooks ginny threatening glare after he called her red in the common room and ginny irresistible smirk when she challenged him to their game of catch the snitch harry tried to close his mind to the images willing them to go away but it was all in vain harry turned his head and found ginny still pouting at him his heart stopped as realization sunk in he was head over heels for ginny weasley and there was nothing he could do about it harry felt his throat constrict as he stared into ginny eyes they had returned to their mischievous sparkle that he so adored stupid git what had he done how could he have not realized what was happening if he had then he could have prevented it or at least stopped it before it got to this all consuming life or death feeling that he now had oh this was going to be torture how does one survive falling for his best friend wait correction his very unavailable taken currently in a relationship with his dorm mate best friend yes he was definitely done for knut for your thoughts harry harry blinked and realized he had been staring at ginny he felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment ginny was no longer pouting but a small smile played at the corner of her mouth harry could never remember finding a girl mouth so intriguing before but he found ginny fascinating earth to harry ginny said pushing herself up to lean on her elbows harry blinked and shook his head pardon ginny laughed i beginning to wonder if you hit your head on that fall are you sure you re okay no yes i fine harry lied ginny raised an eyebrow at harry i guess that means you haventforgotten the terms of our agreement harry chuckled feeling as though he was slowly becoming more himself again no i haventforgotten and donteven try pouting harry warned i not pouting ginny replied pouting harry groaned supper gin you re cooking ginny sighed and pushed herself up to sit cross legged fine i guess you won it fair and square i was so sure i was going to win though i ve been on a winning streak this week harry raised an eyebrow other than correctly predicting the actions of half of the girls in hogwarts concerning my newfound eligibility who else are you stealing money from ginny crossed her arms i did not steal your money harry i won it harry pushed himself up to sit cross legged in front of ginny true enough now who else has been suckered into a wager with you ginny cocked an eyebrow at harry you make me sound like some kind of manipulative trickster who else gin harry pressed ginny grinned her eyes sparkling hermione harry laughed and looked at ginny incredulously you won a bet with hermione how d you manage that ginny shrugged her shoulders as the smile slid from her face she moved her gaze to the grass by her feet and said softly i just know my boyfriend better than hermione harry frowned at ginny there was something in the tone of her voice that disheartened him a stab of anger dashed through harry as he wondered what the great git dean had done did dean do something to hurt you harry asked struggling to keep his voice even ginny sighed no well not really not really harry repeated feeling his anger rise toward the great git ginny looked at harry hesitantly ginny hung her head and mumbled hedidnskmetohosme pardon ginny sighed as she began pulling out blades of grass he didntask me to hogsmeade harry stared at ginny the hurt was evident in her voice and harry began to imagine several hexes he would like to try on dean more importantly however he wanted to do anything to make her feel better even if that included trying to make the great git look good maybe he just assumed you were going together since you know you re dating and all harry said ginny shook her head and laughed softly no harry he made plans to go with seamus and lavender just before i came out here harry jaw dropped you re kidding me ginny raised her eyes to harry s nope harry clenched his fists stupid git ginny shrugged her shoulders whatever it not like we need to spend every waking minute together harry knew ginny was trying to brush off the great git indiscretion she obviously didntwant to make a big deal of it so neither would he instead harry decided to change the subject so when do i get my supper harry asked ginny face brightened how about tomorrow i wontbe long in hogsmeade now so i ll have lot of time to prepare harry grinned tomorrow sounds perfect if dean wasntsmart enough to spend time with ginny on a hogsmeade weekend harry would gladly keep her company harry sat in the common room late saturday afternoon surrounded by textbooks inkbottles and rolls of parchment he had dragged himself out of bed early to see his friends off to hogsmeade he had to do a fair bit of convincing to get ron and hermione to actually leave they had finally relented and promised to come back early at that point ginny had invited ron and hermione to the supper she was preparing for harry she argued that it was easier to cook for a larger group anyway and since ron ate the equivalent of five regular person meals it would give her the opportunity to prepare a proper meal ron had rolled his eyes commenting that ginny was sounding more like their mother every day harry had tried not to feel too disappointed when ginny had extended the invitation to ron and hermione he had looked forward to spending time with ginny but reminded himself that there was no reason for them to spend time alone it not like they were dating or that they ever would after all harry had made a decision to get over this silly crush although he was worried it may be more than a crush straight away as he had stared at the canopy over his bed last night analyzing his revelation about ginny he knew it was a hopeless situation there were too many reasons why he could not have feelings for ginny weasley therefore he had to get over her quickly before it was too late harry stretched his arms above his head he had been working non stop all day he was quite proud of the work he had accomplished already he even ventured a guess that he would be ahead of hermione in some of the work of course he wouldnthold his breath on that one she was quite mad when it came to homework nevertheless he had accomplished more than he thought he could now he could enjoy himself tonight without the nasty weight of homework hanging over his head harry thoughts moved to his lessons that week harry had expected parvati to return to being lavender partner in their classes to harry surprise she continued to sit with him she pointed out that they worked well together and hoped that they could both be mature enough to continue to work together harry had agreed parvati really wasntall that bad she was a nice enough person they just really did not work well together as a couple they had both realized that and came out of the relationship rather unscathed parvati had even made a point to ask harry before she left that morning if there was anything she could get him in hogsmeade harry shook his head thinking it was really too bad he was complete rubbish at dating yet another reason to get over ginny he couldntrisk ruining his friendship because he was completely inept at anything that had to do with girls harry sighed and returned to his homework the afternoon was fading and it would soon be time to meet ginny come in ginny voice floated through the closed door of the room of requirement harry turned the doorknob and did a double take when he walked through the door the room of requirement had made itself into the spitting image of the three broomsticks in hogsmeade the image was so exact that harry turned around to look at the hogwarts hallway behind him to verify his whereabouts he stepped forward allowing the door to shut behind him he gazed around the familiar surroundings as a grin spread across his face do you like it ginny asked as she bustled into the room carrying a tray with bottles of butterbeer harry smiled at her it brilliant harry commented truthfully ginny face lit up as she grinned at harry causing his traitorous stomach to flip i figured if we canttake you to hogsmeade we d bring hogsmeade to you harry smiled as he gazed at ginny thank you ginny shrugged and set the bottles of butterbeer on the table would you like a drink harry nodded and walked to the table that ginny had set the drinks on he picked up a bottle uncorked it and took several deep gulps he closed his eyes enjoying the warmth of the butterbeer sliding down his throat ginny grabbed a bottle for herself and plopped down in a chair harry found himself watching her as she raised the bottle to her lips ginny took several sips and then licked the foam from her lips harry stood motionless mesmerized something wrong harry do i have something on my face ginny asked harry started and realized he had once again been staring unabashedly at ginny what is wrong with me he asked himself he felt his cheeks colour as he sat in a chair opposite ginny no sorry i was er just thinking ginny raised a questioning eyebrow at harry but decided not to pursue it instead she commented i thought you were ron and hermione i asked them to come early to help me get ready have you seen them harry shook his head glad that he had skirted yet another awkward moment with ginny no i haventseen them since they left this morning ginny rolled her eyes i imagine they re off snogging at madame puddifoot or the like harry snorted i d rather not think about that ginny pulled her face into a grimace which harry noted was still a picture of beauty and said neither would i what were they supposed to help you with maybe i can help harry said ginny shook her head no thanks you really should be scolding me for asking for ron and hermione help you could argue that asking for help breaks the terms of our agreement did you cook the supper for tonight harry asked yes then the terms have been fulfilled it was your decision to make more work for yourself by inviting ron and hermione so i dontthink you re cheating by asking for help ginny frowned you re not upset that i invited them are you harry oh bugger er no of course not harry replied trying to sound believable the more the merrier as they say ginny surveyed harry as she bit her bottom lip i sorry i didnteven think to ask you if you would mind harry shook his head feeling his cheeks burn he swallowed and replied why would i mind ginny shrugged well i dontknow about you but sometimes i find that a break from those two isntsuch a bad thing harry shrugged i so busy that i hardly see them anymore or you for that matter ginny leaned her elbows on the table as she studied harry intently how are you doing with all that inordinate amount of work harry harry shrugged as he spun his bottle on the table with his hand so far so good i mean i pretty much exhausted all the time but otherwise things are going well ginny surveyed harry thoughtfully if you re exhausted maybe you need a break harry shrugged that what weekends are for ginny snorted right how much time did you spend relaxing today harry eyed ginny she was staring at him with a mixture of accusation and concern how long have i been here harry asked jokingly ginny sighed harry you need time to recuperate from your busy schedule if you don t you ll go crazy i donthave time to recuperate harry said shrugging you need to make time harry you re a teenager once in awhile you should act like one harry stared hard at ginny he tried not to feel angry by her words he knew she was right he was in fact a teenager and he rarely if ever acted like one but he didntreally have that luxury sure most blokes his age spent much of their time goofing off with friends and chasing after girls but harry did not he could not wasnthis attempt to have a relationship with parvati a perfect example of how harry could not be a normal teenager he was not normal how could he expect anything in his life to be i can t ginny harry replied ginny narrowed her eyes at harry harry you more than anyone deserve to act foolish sometimes you ve put up with so much in your life you have every right to shirk responsibility now and then and have fun ginny i not one to shirk responsibility harry said ginny moaned and put her forehead in her hands i know i know it one of the things i love about you harry stared at ginny with his mouth hanging slightly open he was having a hard time moving beyond the part where ginny said that there was something about him that she loved she had used those words right i wasntimagining it yes yes she did use those words but it doesntmean anything it one of those platonic love you like a brother things nothing worth getting your knickers in a twist over potter ginny continued her rant but you ve got to have fun too harry if you don t you ll go mad and probably take the rest of us with you i have fun when i with you harry blurted and immediately felt like crawling under the table bloody hell i did not just say that i did not just say that ginny surveyed harry her forehead wrinkled as though she were trying to decipher a puzzle her face then softened as she smiled well maybe we need to spend more time together then harry felt his face redden harry cleared his throat so what do you think happened to ron and hermione shouldntthey be here by now even if they decided to skive off their helping duties ginny sighed and looked at her watch yeah i can understand ron being late but not hermione something must have come up shall we get started without them harry shrugged sure their loss ginny smiled as she stood very well mr potter prepare your taste buds to be dazzled harry grinned as he watched ginny sweep from the room to the adjoining kitchen if ginny was half the cook that her mother was harry knew he was in for a treat ginny returned momentarily with two plates piled high with food she set them down on the table before settling into her own seat this looks amazing ginny harry said his mouth watering as his eyes took in the thick steak mound of potatoes and pile of grilled vegetables on his plate ginny lifted her butterbeer bottle towards harry for a toast to having fun harry blushed but raised his glass to ginny to having fun and winning bets ginny stuck her tongue out at harry before clinking her bottle against his they both took a sip from their bottles and turned their attention to their plates harry grasped his fork and knife anxious to taste the steak he d been thinking about all day harry cut into his steak the juices spilling onto his plate the meat was tender and cooked just the way he liked it harry smiled at ginny who was watching him expectantly he raised his fork to his mouth harry potter harry potter sir harry dropped his fork in surprise and it clattered noisily to the table harry turned his head and saw dobby rushing into the room what is it dobby harry asked trying to keep the annoyance out of his voice i about to eat dobby nodded but tugged at harry sleeve dobby apologizes sir but mr wheezy is in trouble harry face blanched as he felt his stomach drop to his knees harry glanced at ginny whose eyes were wide as she stared at dobby what do you mean dobby harry asked an attack sir an attack in hogsmeade dobby was cleaning in professor dumbledore fireplace when an urgent message came in burning dobby sir the message says students attacked in hogsmeade harry mouth felt as though it were full of cotton his heart thudded in his chest as his mind raced he looked at ginny their eyes met and a silent agreement was made harry and ginny stood up and raced out of the room thank you dobby harry called over his shoulder as the door to the room of requirement shut behind him harry and ginny ran full speed down the corridor and down the stairs leading to the main entrance they passed several students on the way and harry cursed at a slytherin fourth year that refused to move out of the way harry jumped down the final four stairs in one leap and ran across the entrance hall towards the doors several aurors stood watch and held their arms up to block the way i need to go to hogsmeade harry panted trying to dodge the aurors arms no mr potter you will stay here one of the aurors stated authoritatively please ginny cried we know there been an attack we want to help the aurors glanced at one another but stood firm no students are to leave the castle harry groaned and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration isntthere anything we can do ginny asked the aurors pleadingly the aurors crossed their arms and shook their head harry glanced at ginny her eyes were wide with fright but also with annoyance harry could see the weasley temper bubbling just under the surface of her well composed face i sorry gin harry said feeling helpless and beginning to pace around the entrance hall ginny crossed her arms and glared at the aurors they ignored her which only seemed to infuriate her further we cantjust stand here and do nothing ginny cried after several minutes harry stopped his frantic pacing and looked at ginny her face was pale and all traces of her temper were gone instead she looked worry stricken harry wished he had something to say to give her comfort but he knew there were no words that would ease the tension instead he walked over to her and put his arm around her ginny leaned her head against harry shoulder wrapping her arms around his waist they stood and waited the castle was eerily quiet the students that had already returned from hogsmeade seemed to have returned to their respective dormitories there were not even students moving to or from the great hall harry and ginny stood alone except for the two aurors guarding the doors three quarters of an hour later harry and ginny broke apart as the sounds of footsteps could be heard clambering up the stairs leading to the castle harry and ginny turned to stare at the door waiting a rush of students poured through the doors they had obviously been in hogsmeade during the attack many of them were scratched bruised or bleeding those that didntappear to have any injuries wore a haunted look on their face the students were surrounded by aurors and professor mcgonagall led them into the entrance hall everyone is to go straight to their dormitory those students that require medical attention will be collected by their head of house the aurors will escort you to your rooms the students began shuffling their separate ways harry watched in horror as student after student walked past him the smell of battle still clinging to them ginny gasped beside him and tugged on his arm there they are she exclaimed harry looked in the direction she was pointing and saw ron and hermione walking through the doorway they were directing several gryffindor students toward the staircase ron had several scratches across his cheek while hermione hair nearly stood on end with electricity ron ginny called ron eyes fell on harry and ginny and he steered hermione in their direction what happened harry and ginny both asked ron ran his fingers through his hair they came out of nowhere one minute we were having a nice walk and the next there were death eaters apparating everywhere what did they want harry asked his mouth dry ron shrugged dontknow they seemed pretty happy just to cause as much destruction as they could harry swallowed do you do you think they were looking for me hermione glanced at ron hesitantly i think they knew you werentgoing to be there harry harry narrowed his eyes at hermione what makes you say that hermione bit her lip there something you need to know harry stared at hermione impatiently his heart pounding frantically in his chest what harry asked it hermione began it all your fault harry stumbled as a set of hands pushed him forcefully in the chest harry regained his balance and stared at his attacker padma padma patil pounded her fists against harry chest as tears streamed down her face it all your fault harry she should have never gone alone but she was too upset they knew about the two of you but it was you they wanted why didntthey take you why werentyou there instead i warned her about you but she wouldntlisten you re always saving everyone why didntyou save her why werentyou there to save her harry why why padma broke down crying harry stood frozen in complete shock as his ex girlfriend twin sister sobbed into his chest harry looked at ron and hermione questioningly ron and hermione glanced at each other and then looked at harry parvati gone a n i trying something new this chapter i ll be switching back and forth from harry pov to parvati s thanks go out to marta for the brilliant suggestion and to kate for your input a n 2 this chapter contains some strong language chapter 24 unknowing parvati gone harry stood dumbfounded he looked from ron to hermione and back again while padma continued sobbing into his chest what harry croaked hermione eyed padma hesitantly we dontreally know what happened we just heard that she was taken hermione replied taken harry asked padma pushed herself away from harry chest her sobbing had gone from hysterical to quiet sniffling harry looked down at padma guilt spreading to every corner of his body padma was staring at the floor her chin quivering it was death eaters padma said quietly they took my sister harry ginny hermione and ron stared at padma silently harry felt a lump rise in his throat padma looked completely lost as though a part of her were missing the four gryffindors stood awkwardly as padma stared at the floor lost in her thoughts hermione broke the silence were you there padma when they took her hermione asked gently padma jumped as though she were surprised to see them there her eyes traveled from hermione to ron to ginny and rested on harry padma eyes were not as accusatory as they had been but they still held a shadow of resentment she moved her gaze back to hermione no i wasntthere not at first anyway padma replied sadly can you tell us what happened ginny asked quietly padma eyes began to fill with tears again parvati had left on her own to check out an obscure shop i had never heard of professor trelawney had recommended it i offered to go with her but since well all week she been spending a lot of time alone padma began her eyes darting angrily to harry she was supposed to meet lavender and me in front of the three broomsticks that where i was waiting for her when padma paused as tears slid down her cheeks when i heard her scream a bone chilling silence filled the entrance hall harry ginny ron and hermione stared at padma wide eyed padma continued i ran to look for her i followed the sound of her voice and saw her at the end of a side street i called to her but she was surrounded by death eaters they were holding her by the th throat they were yelling at her then then they all just disappeared did you hear what they were saying hermione asked padma turned her gaze to harry all i heard was harry name harry felt as though a rock had been dropped in his stomach death eaters had taken parvati and the only clue led straight to him guilt overwhelmed him somehow the death eaters had found out about parvati and him and because of that they had taken parvati padma was right it was harry fault harry stomach twisted painfully padma harry began taking a step towards her i sorry padma took a step back a look of fear crossing her face stay away from me harry harry stopped padma voice cut through him like a knife he swallowed and nodded right harry turned on his heel and walked away he ignored hermione and ginny pleas for him to stop he couldntstay he shouldntstay padma had made her feelings clear harry ran up the many staircases to gryffindor tower he muttered the password to the fat lady threw himself through the portrait hole ignored the curious glances by the students in the common room and ran up the staircase leading to the boys dormitory harry fell onto his bed burying his face in his arms anger pulsed through his body he wanted to scream yell fight he jumped to his feet and kicked his bed angrily he tore the hangings around his bed off their rod and ripped them in half he grabbed his alarm clock and hurled it against the wall finding nothing else to destroy he began pounding his fists into the stone wall beside his bed he ignored the pain the blood how the hell do you expect to catch the snitch if your hands are broken harry turned to see ron leaning against the doorjamb how long have you been there harry growled long enough to see my star seeker destroy his hands ron replied harry slumped down against the wall leaning his bleeding hands over his bent knees scowling why d they take parvati harry muttered ron walked over and slumped down beside harry dontknow mate doesntreally make sense does it harry shrugged watching the blood from his knuckles snake its way down his fingers they must ve known that we dated ron frowned but you ve broken up harry sighed yeah well voldemort knows how i love to play the hero i sure he realizes that i d blame myself if any student from hogwarts was taken taking my ex girlfriend just makes it more personal you would think if he really wanted to rile you he would have taken hermione or me or even ginny neville or luna they were all at the department of mysteries the death eaters would have surely passed that information on ron commented harry groaned who knows why that bastard does what he does ron nodded true enough but harry you cantblame yourself about parvati canti didntpadma say that the only thing she heard when the death eaters took parvati was my name harry argued ron leaned his head back against the wall he seemed to be choosing his words carefully you cantblame yourself for something that is completely out of your control there was no way for you to know that parvati was in danger there was no way for you to stop it from happening there was nothing you could have done harry it not your fault harry pushed himself to his feet and began pacing drops of blood splattered on the floor as it fell from his fingertips but it is my fault if i could just get rid of voldemort for good then everyone would be safe ron snorted lifting himself to his feet harry it not up to you to get rid of v voldemort dontput that on yourself maybe it is up to me harry muttered under his breath pardon ron queried nothing harry mumbled waving his hand at ron dismissively ron surveyed harry harry you donthave to be involved in this harry glared at ron i already involved ron i ve got this fucking scar on my forehead as proof donttell me i not involved ron shook his head you know sometimes i think you like being in the middle of everything harry looked at ron incredulously what ron nodded gaining momentum it like you cantstand that the death eaters went after someone else it always has to be about you about the boy who lived maybe it not about you maybe voldemort has some other sick plan that has absolutely nothing to do with you this war is not only about you harry you donthave a fucking clue harry spat so tell me ron yelled what with the mystery what with the mightier than thou attitude what makes you better than the rest of us i not i didntsay you dontunderstand harry growled how could i i ve never had what you have the fame the glory the adoration of our teachers you re right harry i dontunderstand you ve never given me the chance to try and understand you take everything on your own shoulders and dontthink twice about anyone else and we ve tried harry we ve tried to understand did you even notice the rest of us fighting by your side last spring did you care that we risked being expelled never mind killed when we went with you did you even think about the fact that hermione almost died did you ever wonder what effect those brains had on me did you ever question why ginny has no closefriends in her own year no you haventbecause you re so wrapped up in your own world where everything centres around the boy who lived that you canteven see what in front of you we ve put ourselves on the line without hesitation and for what when do we get our glory harry when do we get recognized for our part ron ranted you want recognition harry blasted you want the fame and the glory take it i dontwant it i never asked for this dontyou think it kills me that all of you have been dragged into this i tried to push all of you away this summer but you wouldntlet me i didntwant you involved i know what you and hermione and ginny have done for me and i know i dontdeserve it but there are things you dontunderstand there are things you dontknow tell us harry ron pleaded we canthelp you if we dontknow harry ran his fingers through his hair i i i can t ron groaned fine you want to fly solo go ahead but dontexpect us to put up with this bullshit we re tired of this same charade being played over and over again we re tired of trying to convince you that you re not to blame when you re willing to climb out of this pit of gloom you ve thrown yourself in you know where to find us ron stormed out of the dorm leaving harry glaring after him parvati moaned softly as she struggled to sweep cobwebs from her mind she felt groggy and cold and sore she struggled to form coherent thoughts her brain would not cooperate she had no idea where she was or how she got there she lay face down on a hard dirt packed floor her body aching and heavy parvati pried her eyes open only to be met with an inky blackness she pushed herself up balancing her weight on her hands as she sat and peered into the darkness around her her head pounded furiously drumming a steady rhythm in her ears parvati drew her knees into her chest and hugged them tightly she fought against the pain in her head she struggled to remember parvati grasped to the first memory that flashed through her mind hogsmeade i was in hogsmeade i was alone harry couldntgo harry parvati heart ached dully as her thoughts moved to harry although she had played the well adjusted moving on with my life ex girlfriend role extremely well padma and lavender didntbuy it they remembered how parvati had talked about everything and anything harry potter for the past six months they knew how embarrassed she had been when she kissed him out of the blue after a potions lesson and how elated she had been when he had kissed her in care of magical creatures and then he had finally asked her to be his girlfriend parvati had been thrilled and she had never been more devastated than the day he dumped her padma and lavender knew this as well parvati had not been completely surprised by harry actions she had noticed early on how his demeanor always changed as soon as ginny weasley was around parvati had at first believed it to be coincidence but eventually realized she was only fooling herself harry was obviously attracted to ginny whether he was willing to admit it or not the fact that harry seemed to be forcefully denying it is what gave parvati hope if harry did not want to admit his feelings for ginny wouldntthat mean he would want someone else and why couldntthat someone else be parvati parvati sighed she knew she had been a fool she knew she should have walked away when she first realized harry heart was elsewhere she knew she was acting desperate and pathetic and she felt ashamed but she couldntlet go she held on to the faint hope that he may eventually notice her really notice her like he noticed ginny but parvati hopes were never fulfilled which led her to being in hogsmeade alone both lavender and padma had tried to keep her company but she did not feel like pretending truthfully she knew she did not have to pretend with either of them however she did not want to have to put up with their sympathetic smiles or knowing looks she didnthave the strength they had tried to convince her that she shouldntbe alone but she had been adamant they acquiesced only after parvati had agreed to meet them at the three broomsticks in the late afternoon parvati replayed what she could remember of her afternoon in her mind parvati walked to hogsmeade with padma padma kept the conversation light and parvati decided to go with her sister into a few shops parvati could tell that padma was trying to cheer parvati up but parvati knew what she really needed was some time alone they eventually parted ways with padma reminding parvati of her promise to meet lavender and her later at the three broomsticks parvati slipped into a few shops and then made her way to a small shop called navigating nostradamus professor trelawney had recommended the place and upon entering parvati immediately determined why the small shop was crammed full with books crystal balls tarot cards candles an assortment of teas telescopes among many other objects that parvati could not identify parvati took her time and examined the items on the shelves in awe parvati eventually found herself in a fascinating conversation with the shopkeeper a tiny slight witch with long frizzy blonde hair and bright blue eyes talked excitedly with parvati about the various artifacts in the shop when she learned that parvati was from hogwarts they fell into another conversation about professor trelawney the shopkeeper told parvati that she was scandalized when she heard that that horrible umbridge woman had nearly run trelawney out of hogwarts parvati and the shopkeeper shared their love of divination and their belief that trelawney was a remarkable teacher they talked for over an hour oblivious to the other people in the shop oblivious to a pair of wizards in long black robes listening intently to their conversation the chime of a clock on the wall alerted parvati to the fact that she was supposed to be meeting padma and lavender she said goodbye to the shopkeeper promising to stop by the next time she was in hogsmeade and to pass on a hello to professor trelawney parvati left the shop with a distinct bounce in her step she was feeling better than she had all week it was refreshing to find someone to talk to about her passion sure lavender enjoyed divination as well but lavender much preferred to talk about boys and parvati wasnttoo keen on that subject at the moment parvati walked down the small roadway leading to the main road in hogsmeade in the distance she could see students crossing the street ahead of her she picked up her pace anxious to meet lavender and padma and tell them about her amazing conversation with the shopkeeper of navigating nostradamus parvati was nearing the main road when she felt an unknown force throw her to the ground the sting of a hex ran through her as she fought to catch her breath after being winded by her fall parvati felt someone grab her arms and yank her to her feet panic set in and parvati screamed as her eyes fell on the masks of two death eaters one of the death eaters gripped parvati by the throat and yelled at her you best be keeping that mouth of yours shut he growled parvati fought to breathe as her windpipe constricted by the force of the death eater grip tears ran down her face as she nodded her head the second death eater pointed a wand in parvati face this can be easy or this can be difficult keep quiet and we may not hurt you he snarled parvati struggled against the hand around her neck she thought about her wand inside her robes but knew she couldntget to it fast enough wh what do y you want parvati choked what did i tell you keep that mouth of yours shut you stupid girl the first death eater shouted his grip tightening parvati began to feel light headed barely conscious of the fact that several other death eaters had appeared parvati closed her eyes against the rain of voices around her are you sure that the one no doubt about it how can you be sure i sure heard her talking and everything she definitely the one are you going to get us what we want sneered a death eater parvati opened her eyes and found the mask of a death eater inches from her face we cantdo this here shouted one of the new death eaters even with potter not here the place is swarming with aurors parvati parvati recognized her sister voice she fought against the death eater grip flailing her arms and kicking her feet in earnest she tried to call out but the grip on her throat closed around her tighter she fought against the haze that was filling her brain she was vaguely aware of a strange feeling behind her navel colours and wind assaulted her eyes before she felt her body slam onto a cold hard floor and everything went black parvati shivered her face was wet with tears she had been taken by death eaters she was alone the impenetrable darkness closed in on her she could hardly breathe her fingers sought out the pocket in her robes empty she was being held by death eaters and she had no wand she closed her eyes and sobbed into her knees as despair engulfed her harry sat with his back against the same wall where he had sat beside ron less than an hour ago before things had got completely out of hand harry groaned as he banged his head against the wall he had said horrible things to ron and ron had said his fair share they had both been completely irrational harry could see that now but seeing it was one thing admitting it to ron was another of course harry wasntsure if ron regretted the things he had said harry guessed that a lot of what ron said had been lying under the surface for some time harry understood how ron felt frustrated by well everything things had not been fair for either of them although in completely different ways harry always got the glory or blame and ron was always overlooked this was how it had always been and neither of them could do anything about it harry winced as he clenched and unclenched his fist his knuckles had stopped bleeding but were swollen considerably he considered going to the hospital wing but wondered how long it would be before someone else assaulted harry with accusations of being the reason for parvati kidnapping wasntpadma right she had heard harry name didntthat implicate harry as the guilty party harry groaned and leaned his head back against the wall he closed his eyes what if ron was right what if the attack had absolutely nothing to do with harry no there were too many coincidences to remove harry from the situation completely he was definitely a part of the plan that took parvati away still skulking in sorrow harry eyes snapped open ginny stood in the doorway her arms crossed and her eyebrows raised you shouldntbe here ginny harry growled fighting not to notice how cute she looked when she was mad ginny studied harry thoughtfully ron said his talk with you didntgo so well harry snorted that an understatement ginny walked in and sat cross legged on the floor in front of harry he stared determinedly at his knees avoiding her eyes at all costs want to talk about it ginny asked no ginny sighed will you listen then harry raised his eyes to look at ginny her eyes reflected sadness and defeat what wrong ginny harry asked abandoning his own thoughts at once i worried about you ginny said softly you dontneed to worry about me harry said stubbornly i fine harry you cantkeep pushing us away harry sighed i know ron told me i just need some time alone what for to wallow in self pity harry shrugged yeah maybe ginny chuckled well at least you ll admit it they sat silently harry stole glances at ginny occasionally she had pulled her knees up in front of her and rested her chin on them she stared silently at a spot on the floor seemingly lost in her thoughts after some time harry broke the silence what are you thinking about harry asked ginny head shot up to look at harry nothing harry smirked how is it that you can give me hell for not talking to you but you donthave to talk to me ginny shrugged i didntgive you hell for not talking not this time ginny rested her chin on her knees again i rest my case harry studied ginny something that ron had said earlier flashed through harry mind gin hmm do you have any friends in your year harry asked as delicately as he could manage ginny looked at harry questioningly sure why harry shrugged i dontknow i guess i just wondered are you close with anyone in your year who are your best friends ginny frowned and seemed to hesitate well i ve got hermione and and you you re my best friends harry frowned but that didntreally happen until this year and a bit last year what about before then who were you close with for your first three years here harry i dontwant to talk about this ginny said annoyed harry pressed on why gin tell me ginny eyes narrowed no harry c mon gin harry pleaded ginny nostrils flared as she glared at him harry no one wants to be friends with the girl that was possessed by tom riddle teenage mind that a little scary for eleven year olds harry heart ached but ginny that wasntyour fault your classmates should be able to see that ginny nodded her expression softening they did eventually dontworry harry i survived i dontneed your pity harry shook his head i should have been a better friend i should have noticed i sorry gin ginny smiled and shook her head dismissivley at harry we re friends now and that all that matters harry heart ached as he forced a smile to his lips so now that i told you one of my deep dark secrets are you going to tell me what really going on ginny asked harry frowned what do you mean ginny bit her lip and hesitated ron said that you mentioned that there was something that we didntknow about he thought it had something to do with v voldemort harry looked into ginny dark eyes he wished he could tell her he wanted to tell her he just couldn t i want to tell you i just not ready yet harry said softly are you sure ginny asked quietly i know i not ron or hermione but i am a great listener harry smiled i know you are gin but i can t not yet but you will tell me when you re ready ginny asked harry heart thudded painfully he wanted to share everything with her he hated that he was making her feel as though she werenta good enough friend to him that he would want to include her harry swallowed hard ginny i promise i ll tell you when i ready thanks harry ginny said smiling and giving harry hand a squeeze harry winced what on earth have you done to yourself ginny gasped pulling harry hand towards her harry fought to ignore the swirling in his stomach as ginny clutched his hand uh i guess i took my frustration out on the wall ginny clicked her tongue you need to have this looked at harry he sighed yeah i reckon i should come ginny said pulling harry by his arm to his feet i ll go with you you donthave to harry argued while secretly quite pleased i not going to get any studying done i might as well keep you company harry smiled softly as ginny eyes met his ginny grinned crookedly at him she added maybe we could sneak into the kitchens and grab something to eat too i starving harry laughed that sounded like a good plan indeed he followed her out of the room marveling at how she always managed to lighten his mood when he was with her anything seemed possible chapter 25 confusion honestly mr potter injury finds its way to you on its own there no need for you to self inflict injury harry nodded apologetically to madam pomfrey as he sat on the edge of a bed in the hospital wing madam pomfrey held harry hands in front of her casting various healing charms to mend his injured knuckles i know madam pomfrey i sorry to bother you harry replied sheepishly madam pomfrey pressed her lips into a thin line should i even bother asking why you did this to yourself harry glanced at ginny she was standing at the foot of the bed with her arms crossed and giving harry a look that strongly reminded him of mrs weasley i was frustrated harry mumbled shifting his gaze to stare at his shoes madam pomfrey tutted such nonsense perhaps your girlfriend can talk some sense into you while i fetch your potion harry looked up at madam pomfrey in confusion and then felt his face burn in realization that madam pomfrey was talking about ginny she not harry began but madam pomfrey was already out of earshot harry glanced at ginny embarrassedly to harry relief ginny seemed content to ignore pomfrey comment in fact she seemed oblivious to it her eyes were glazed over and she was nibbling on her lower lip distractedly ginny ginny started and raised her eyes to harry pardon ginny asked harry forehead wrinkled in concern are you feeling okay gin you seem preoccupied or something ginny plastered a smile on her face that harry knew was not genuine i fine gin ginny walked over and sat on the hospital bed beside harry i fine harry i ve just got something on my mind you and me both harry commented ginny looked at harry and grinned i ll tell you my secrets if you tell me yours harry smiled half heartedly and found himself lost in ginny deep brown eyes how had he never noticed how dark they were or how expressive he realized now that he could judge ginny mood just by her eyes they told him everything he needed to know for some strange reason that comforted him she had completely opened herself up to him even if she was keeping secrets he knew in time she would tell him what was on her mind but for now her focus was not on herself he could read her frustration and worry for him as though it were an open book her eyes pleaded with him begged him to open up and share the burden with a sudden jolt of realization harry knew he could tell ginny everything she would understand she would help him with the questions the fear and the magnitude of it all he just had to say it i harry began fighting against the quaffle sized lump in his throat he swallowed hard and took a deep breath i mr potter at last i ve found you what are you doing out of the dormitory harry looked up and saw a very stern looking professor mcgonagall crossing the hospital wing her usually tidy bun was falling apart and her face was pale harry shifted uncomfortably sorry professor you were looking for me harry asked hoping to avoid discussing why he was yet again in the hospital wing mcgonagall turned to ginny miss weasley return to the common room at once mr potter you will come with me to the headmaster office ginny stood abruptly and nodded at professor mcgonagall yes professor ginny replied casting a worried glance at harry before walking swiftly out of the room professor mcgonagall turned her gaze to harry he flinched under her piercing glare wondering why he was being summoned to dumbledore office the look on mcgonagall face did not ease harry mind one bit madam pomfrey bustled over with a fizzing potion and thrust it toward harry he took it without comment feeling as though he were the most detestable being on earth for a few blissful moments ginny had allowed him to forget about what had happened in hogsmeade today reality was now crashing down on him with full force he tipped the flask back and tried not to wince at the terrible taste he knew he would get no sympathy here is he excused poppy mcgonagall asked yes minerva in just a moment madam pomfrey replied and then turned to harry mr potter i dontwant to see you in my hospital wing again with such an unnecessary injury in times of war i busy enough with life threatening cases i dontneed my attention being diverted because of foolish nonsense am i understood harry swallowed he had never heard madam pomfrey speak in such a way before he was humiliated and ashamed of his actions he felt like a child being scolded and he deserved it he silently wondered why madam pomfrey would be dealing with war related injuries she was the hospital matron for hogwarts as far as harry knew there had not been anyone involved in the war from hogwarts until today what else was going on that he didntknow of who was being injured that required the attention of madam pomfrey harry glanced at madam pomfrey and found her stern gaze awaiting his response yes madam pomfrey i understand harry replied very well mcgonagall said follow me potter mcgonagall swept from the room causing harry to jog to catch up with her he chanced a glance at her her lips were pressed into a disapproving frown and her eyes were locked on the corridor in front of her harry knew mcgonagall to be a formidable witch but at that moment she looked downright scary they remained silent as they rode the spiral staircase to dumbledore office professor mcgonagall escorted harry into the room nodded curtly at professor dumbledore and left without a word the tension in the room was palpable dumbledore rose from the chair behind his desk and moved to the window overlooking the hogwarts grounds harry stood awkwardly waiting harry studied his professor profile dumbledore face was drawn he looked old and tired each time harry saw dumbledore he seemed to have lost a bit more of the sparkle that usually reflected in his eyes harry found the change in dumbledore rather unnerving have a seat harry dumbledore commanded quietly maintaining his post at the window harry complied and sank into the familiar chair in front of dumbledore desk was madam pomfrey able to heal your hands dumbledore inquired yes professor harry replied embarrassment flooding him once again dumbledore nodded as he continued to gaze out the window you must stop this harry harry swallowed stop what breaking his hands visiting the hospital wing endangering his classmates the war what exactly was he supposed to stop sir harry queried dumbledore turned to face harry his eyes saddened i imagine you blame yourself for miss patil disappearance harry shifted in his chair and nodded he braced himself for the blame he so richly deserved dumbledore sighed and walked slowly to his chair he lowered himself and steepled his fingers in front of him i guilty of the same crime harry eyes darted to dumbledore sorry dumbledore nodded i ve been sitting up here blaming myself for allowing my students to go to hogsmeade they are my responsibility after all harry shook his head and straightened himself in his chair but you couldnthave known sir harry insisted i should have realized voldemort wouldntallow my students to enjoy their youth i an old fool dumbledore continued harry shook his head professor you couldnthave known you just wanted your students to enjoy themselves there nothing wrong with that dumbledore was apparently ignoring harry it all my fault i sent miss patil to her fate i am to blame i should have prevented this i might as well have delivered her to the death eaters directly and saved them all the trouble i should resign from my post as headmaster no parent will trust me with their child harry pushed himself to his feet angrily no you couldnthave prevented this it not your fault sir it the death eaters and voldemort they re the ones responsible you shouldntblame yourself dumbledore pinned harry with his ice blue gaze and neither should you harry felt his breath catch in his throat he stared at dumbledore who returned harry gaze unblinkingly harry realized dumbledore ploy he had blamed himself committing harry own self deprecating act dumbledore had been blaming himself taking the weight of everything that had happened on his own shoulders just as harry had done harry blinked as realization sunk in it frustrating to hear someone take the blame for something that is so completely out of their control isntit harry dumbledore asked softly harry lowered himself to his chair feeling confused perhaps you can understand the frustration your friends have been feeling dumbledore continued harry stared numbly at dumbledore desk you are not to blame for what happened to miss patil harry in all honesty i have much more reason to take the blame than you however neither of us could have known what was to happen the only crime we are guilty of is trying to live our lives as normally as possible in the face of war and i do not believe that is a crime worthy of shame harry nodded feeling wretched nonetheless dumbledore sighed this war is just beginning harry there are going to be many casualties we nearly lost miss tonks and mr shacklebolt is still missing not to mention the muggles who have already lost their lives now miss patil has been taken i for one cannot even begin to guess the purpose she will serve for voldemort and that is what frightens me the most but you must understand harry there will be losses we cannot stop that but it is up to me to end the war harry said quietly i afraid that not true harry harry head shot up to look at dumbledore questioningly it is true that your destiny ties you to voldemort as the prophecy states you are the only one who may vanquish the dark lord however we would be fools to believe that vanquishing the dark lord will end the war he may be the leader but he has many followers while voldemort may be the most visible enemy he is not the only one this war may wage on long after voldemort is gone harry gaped at dumbledore but but what harry dumbledore asked his eyes focused sharply on harry am i upsetting you by implying that this war extends far beyond what your involvement will be harry shifted uncomfortably as ron words echoed in his head the war is not only about you harry ron was right dumbledore was right there was a lot more to this war than harry and voldemort and there would be many more injuries and deaths harry had been focusing far too much on the prophecy that he had lost sight of the big picture harry did indeed play a role and an important one at that but it wasntthe only role this war was bigger than harry it was bigger than voldemort they were just pawns on each side between dark and light evil and good losers and winners harry was determined to be on the winning side he raised his head and met dumbledore eyes unflinchingly thank you sir harry said dumbledore smiled sadly i here for you harry as are your friends dontforget that harry nodded dumbledore leaned forward harry i must ask can you think of any reason that voldemort would want miss patil harry searched his mind for everything he had learned about parvati in his opinion parvati was the least likely person to be of any use to voldemort no sir dumbledore nodded his blue gaze penetrating harry did you tell her of the prophecy harry shook his head no i haventtold anyone since remus he decided not to mention the fact that he was about to tell ginny before mcgonagall interrupted him in the hospital wing dumbledore gaze softened i suspected not you are not one to share your burdens harry stared at dumbledore wondering how to take his last comment was he suggesting that harry should share his burdens or was he agreeing with harry decision to keep it to himself harry felt so confused he longed for a time when he knew nothing of voldemort or the blasted prophecy that haunted him day and night i shall ask you to return to your dormitory harry i fear we are facing a difficult week and we will all need what rest we can get i must also remind you that you have remarkable friends harry i suggest you take a moment to make note harry nodded and rose from his chair yes sir thank you harry left dumbledore office with his mind much more clouded than when he entered while his feelings of guilt for parvati abduction had been alleviated somewhat thoughts of the prophecy swirled through his mind battling with his thoughts of his friends who were unwavering in their loyalty to him he was such a prat he only hoped he hadntpushed ron too far the sound of chains clinking and a door unlocking roused parvati from her troubled thoughts she did not know how long she had been well wherever she was her body ached from the cold hard floor beneath her her mouth was dry and her stomach rumbled in complaint she pushed herself to her feet hesitantly her eyes wide and blinking against the blackness that engulfed her her heart pounded frantically in her ribcage she tilted her head trying to determine the direction of the sounds she in here parvati spun herself around blindly her ears straining for another sound click parvati tensed in anticipation her heart thundered loudly in her head a bright light pierced parvati eyes as a door was opened widely she threw her arm protectively over her face to block out the offending light her eyes watered and she blinked rapidly trying desperately to regain her sight to see what fate had in store for her move it parvati stumbled as she felt a sharp pain in the back of her leg she lowered her arms and squinted around her she could make out the shape of two people in robes as her vision focused she recognized the unforgettable masks of death eaters she began trembling violently i said move parvati doubled over pain shooting through her side where a boot had connected with her she stumbled forward struggling to catch her breath and determined not to let these bullies wear her down she was strong she would not give in easily she wasnta gryffindor for nothing the death eaters pushed her down a corridor it was dimly lit parvati realized despite her initial reaction to the blinding light it seemed to be underground the floor walls and ceiling were stone water trickled down the wall in spidery webs parvati shuddered as a flood of cold air washed over her keep going barked the shorter of the two death eaters parvati obeyed and began climbing a rickety staircase she was shivering uncontrollably whether from fear or from the chill in the air she wasntsure her teeth chattered and she wrapped her arms around herself tightly the stairs creaked with each step and she wondered vaguely if they would hold her weight she was nearing the top the chill deepened and parvati could see her breath come out of her in vaporous puffs then with a blast of cold fury the top door opened parvati felt her knees give out she was vaguely aware of the death eaters yelling at her but she could not move horrible memories flashed through her mind all happiness shrank away she knew only grief sadness and despair she dragged her eyes to the open doorway two tall cloaked figures flanked the door dementors parvati gasped she felt a tug on her arms as her body was dragged up the remaining stairs she was sure she was going to be sick nausea wrapped itself around her she had never been that close to a dementor before she couldntthink straight she couldntmove she was lost she was alone eventually the icy air ebbed away her senses returned though her body continued to shiver uncontrollably parvati opened her eyes and found herself in some sort of sitting room the death eaters had deposited her and then left she pushed herself up and looked around other than a single armchair placed in front of a fireplace the room appeared empty parvati walked hesitantly to the fireplace if there floo powder you wontfind any floo powder here parvati jumped at the sound of a high cold voice she spun around and felt her jaw drop in a silent scream of terror before her stood not a man but a monster the body was far too skeletal to be a man and its face had slits for eyes that burned red there was no nose but two narrow openings like those on a snake its skin was pallid and gaunt this thing could not be human no human looked like that you are parvati patil parvati backed against the wall sobbing silently answer me you insolent girl parvati was pulled to her knees by an unknown force she felt her jaw move and her voice reply yes sir that better you should know better than to fight me girl you will not win parvati kept her head down as her hands and knees ground into the wood floor she squeezed her eyes shut and prayed that she would survive this that she would see her sister again that she would wake up and this would all be a nightmare now the high pitched voice announced let see if you can give me what i want in the next instant parvati felt her head split in two or at least she was sure it had the pain blinded her she gasped and struggled to breathe thoughts and memories were pulled from her mind viciously it was as though someone or something held her mind as an open book and was flipping through the pages tearing out a page now and then when it was deemed necessary the thoughts were sorted through so quickly that parvati could not make sense of her own memories she vomited and fell to her side in a shivering crumpled heap for the second time that day everything went black harry clambered through the portrait hole his mind still befuddled from his conversation with dumbledore for a wizard of such wisdom dumbledore sure could be confusing harry musings were brought to a halt as a deafening hush fell over the common room as the fat lady portrait swung shut behind him every eye in the common room was on him some of the stares were accusatory some hopeful others fearful harry froze the dreaded spotlight finding him once again everyone stared at him in anticipation waiting waiting for what harry hadnta clue he could tell they expected him to say something but what have they found her harry ginny voice harry sought the girl that belonged to that voice in the crowd of gryffindors she stepped forward her hands clasped in front of her worriedly her dark red hair falling in waves around her shoulders and her eyes open wide with hope and fear harry locked his eyes on her no ginny parvati still missing several gasps and sobs escaped from the people gathered in the common room whispers erupted as conversations reconvened obviously the chatter before harry had entered the common room had evolved around parvati harry however had another issue to tend to he broke his gaze from ginny and glanced to the seats in front of the fireplace sure enough he found ron and hermione settled together on the couch hermione eyes were red and swollen the events of the day had obviously taken their toll ron was sitting with his arms crossed and a scowl darkening his face harry groaned inwardly ron was not going to make this easy harry glanced back at ginny only to discover dean with his arm around her whispering in her ear harry clenched his jaw and tried to ignore the rage of jealousy that erupted in his gut ginny eyes lifted to harry s they stood with their eyes locked for several moments the great git was still whispering in ginny ear ginny blinked and then turned and placed her hand on the dean chest talking to the great git in earnest harry tore his eyes away his breathing short harry cursed silently he had no right to be jealous ginny was his friend if she needed comfort after the horrible events of the day who was he to complain about who she got that comfort from but damn he wished it was him instead of dean harry sighed and walked over to ron and hermione ignoring the eyes that followed his movement he slumped into the chair next to the couch a wide range of emotions warring within him he looked at hermione who was sitting on the edge of the couch her hands clasped in her lap nibbling nervously on her lower lip harry glanced at ron and found him glaring at the fire obviously not prepared to make the first move i sorry ron harry said ron shifted slightly but continued to stare at the fire i said some things that were completely unfair and stupid harry continued ron glanced at harry his jaw still clenched hermione nudged him with her elbow ron frowned at hermione harry persisted i know the war isntonly about me dumbledore helped me see that he also convinced me that parvati kidnapping is not my fault ron scowled i told you that harry sighed i know that what i saying ron you were right i was wrong to think everything about this war revolves around me but you were wrong too i do not have a mightier than thou attitude i do have a fault and that is trying to keep everyone else safe and frankly i still believe you d be safer if you werentfriends with me but you re all so stubborn that no matter how terrible i am you wontleave me alone even though you re a stupid prat i am grateful that you have stuck with me you re my best mate and i shouldnthave taken my anger and frustration out on you believe me i appreciate everything all of you have done for me you guys are all i have harry said ron shifted uncomfortably hermione was blinking her eyes rapidly she elbowed ron once again ron rolled his eyes at hermione and then turned to harry i sorry too mate i was way out of line with that glory stuff i know you hate the fame it was a stupid thing to say harry nodded and held his hand out to ron forgiven ron nodded and shook harry hand forgiven hermione hiccoughed and sniffled ron rolled his eyes and turned to harry can you believe her harry chuckled and ran his fingers distractedly through his hair you okay hermione he asked hermione nodded wiping her tears on her sleeve yes i just wish the two of you werentsuch boys ron arched an eyebrow at her really i rather thought you enjoyed the fact that i a boy harry groaned as hermione gasped and punched ron in the shoulder ron i dontwant to hear about that harry exclaimed ron laughed and dodged another slap from hermione sorry mate i canthelp that i irresistible harry rolled his eyes and laughed as hermione began an all out attack on ron they were his best mates and he couldntask for better parvati slowly became conscious of voices around her the pounding in her head filled her with nausea so much so that she could have sworn she could smell the sickness in the air around her that absurd she told herself why on earth would she smell vomit surely the hogwarts house elves wouldntleave vomit lying around parvati tried to move her body confusion wrapping her as she tried to figure out why her bed was so hard fear spread through her as she realized her hands were bound behind her back she pried her eyes open and blinked repeatedly trying to focus on her surroundings immediately she discerned that she was not in hogwarts although the room did seem vaguely familiar she squeezed her eyes shut trying to force her mind to focus on something other than the incessant pounding then she heard them again voices she was of no use then a low drawling voice asked not as planned but i am confident she will still be useful a cold high pitched voice answered i had hoped not to involve the flighty professor but the girl will be a suitable sacrifice what may i do my lord contact erena tell her to bring the seer to me of course my lord i am at your service as always parvati listened to the swish of robes she squeezed her eyes shut panic becoming her only companion she sensed someone moving close to her she held her breath and dared not open her eyes she felt an icy cold finger run across her cheek she fought the urge to scream to cry out she shuddered causing the skeletal finger to pull away the high pitched voice was the last thing she heard before the pain in her skull overwhelmed her slamming her into darkness once again a suitable sacrifice indeed a n please review a n hello anyone there i back sorry sorry a million times sorry i have a suitcase full of excuses but the important thing is that chapter 26 is finally here special thanks to the cunha family steph nat butterbeer and rads for giving me the encouragement and support i needed to keep going i hope you enjoy chapter 26 below the belt harry spent the greater part of sunday in the gryffindor common room poring over his homework after a short trip to the great hall for breakfast he was blatantly aware that although his friends and dumbledore did not blame him for parvati disappearance the remainder of the hogwarts population was skeptical the hissed whispers and snide comments were more than harry could handle with his already frayed nerves ron and hermione took pity on him and snuck him food for both lunch and supper hermione always the voice of reason reminded harry that he couldnthide forever but for the time being harry enjoyed his reprieve harry tried to ignore the fact that his fellow gryffindors were also keeping a wide berth around him he d survived worse and took solace in the fact that ron and hermione were by his side no matter what ginny on the other hand harry sighed and raised his eyes from the textbook lying in front of him he scanned the common room she was still nowhere to be seen he hadntseen ginny since the previous night when she was talking to dean she had disappeared shortly thereafter he tried to ignore the hollow feeling that had invaded his insides it was unlike ginny to not ask about his conversation with dumbledore surely she had been concerned when she left the hospital wing had something happened since however with sinking realization harry had to admit that he wasntnecessarily on her priority list she had her schoolwork and dean harry stomach twisted unpleasantly as a scowl spread across his features he returned to his textbook and worked well into the night shutting out the world around him after a fitful sleep and a squelching run in the freezing rain harry entered the great hall monday morning in dark spirits the frenzied whispers of students as he walked by did nothing to improve his mood he slid silently into his seat and nodded grudgingly in greeting at ron and hermione seated across from him he grabbed a slice of toast and tore into it attacking it as though it were the source of his irritation ron and hermione were wise enough to stay quiet harry grasped his glass of pumpkin juice and took several deep gulps before setting it back down he was about to take another bite of his toast when another blow was thrown his way ginny had finally made an appearance unfortunately she was walking hand in hand with the great git harry watched as they made their way along the gryffindor table dean stopped halfway and was about to take a seat when he noticed ginny continue along he tugged on her hand forcing her to spin around and face him harry insides rolled unpleasantly as a shot of anger pulsed through his veins from ginny stance harry knew she was not happy harry held his breath in anticipation waiting for ginny to release her temper on dean the stupid git deserved everything she could give harry watched in horror as ginny shoulders slumped and she allowed herself to be pulled into the seat beside dean harry was outraged harry harry turned his glare to hermione causing her to flinch harry she repeated softly you need to calm down harry furrowed his eyebrows together in confusion she nodded towards his hands harry glanced down his right fist had squished his toast to crumbs while his left hand grasped his glass of pumpkin juice which was now boiling furiously harry set the glass down in shock blimey harry what got you in such a state ron asked looking warily at the bubbling pumpkin juice harry scowled and dropped the toast crumbs on his plate i didntsleep well he responded hermione sighed maybe you should take a break from all of your extra work harry harry raked his fingers through his hair no the attack in hogsmeade proves how much we all need to be prepared i wontquit now hermione pursed her lips but wisely refrained from saying anything else for which harry was glad he didntknow if he could restrain from hexing her in his current state what going on with ginny ron asked a hint of irritation in his voice harry flinched at ron question sorry harry asked wishing his voice hadntcome out as a squeak ron frowned and waved his hand in ginny direction ginny i dontthink i saw her all day yesterday and this morning she not even sitting with us i think she taken the same broody potion as you harry harry scowled hermione sighed cantshe spend time with her boyfriend without you two raising your hackles over it ron snorted stupid prat doesnteven take her to hogsmeade and now she spending all her time with him she deserves better than that worthless git harry cheered silently you cantchoose your sister boyfriends ron hermione chastised but she could do so much better ron complained harry single again why doesntshe go out with him harry stared down at his plate fighting the urge to slam his fist on the table and agree wholeheartedly with ron harry knew ron was trying to prove a point and meant nothing by his comment but harry really wished he could ask that same question well that obvious hermione stated harry raised his eyes to look at her she turned her gaze from ron and looked at harry he thought he saw a hint of a smile in her eyes first of all she already has a boyfriend ron whether you like it or not second harry hasntasked her to go out with him harry face burned the look in hermione eyes was making him truly uncomfortable hmm ron responded i reckon ginny not harry type either so it not likely to happen anyway harry frowned at ron what do you mean she not my type harry could have kicked himself not only did his voice come out in a high pitched whine but he couldntbe anymore transparent why didnthe just stand up on the table dance a jig and announce to the entire school that he fancied ginny weasley ron shrugged you go for the exotic types first cho then parvati ginny nothing like them no she isnt besides ron continued harry could have any girl in the school i doubt he d choose my baby sister harry shifted uncomfortably ginny was the only girl in the school he d choose harry snorted thinking how much easier it would be if he could just point and choose who would you choose harry harry snapped his head toward hermione what who would you choose if you could have any girl who would it be hermione asked a smirk playing on her lips harry shrugged trying to avoid hermione eyes dontknow hermione raised an eyebrow disbelievingly harry frowned at her and returned to staring at his plate hermione was really grating his nerves this morning the sound of hundreds of wings filled the great hall students stared up into the stormy ceiling as their owls made deliveries a brown barn owl landed in front of hermione delivering the daily prophet hermione slipped her coins into the owl leather pouch and watched the bird take off in flight she turned to the newspaper and scanned the front page gasping immediately what ron and harry asked leaning towards her to see the paper hermione hand covered her mouth as she held the newspaper for harry to read the headline attack in hogsmeade fodder for potter blinking back at harry was a picture of himself taken during the triwizard tournament in fourth year harry felt nauseous a slow buzz began to gain momentum in the great hall harry scanned the room watching as students huddled together to read their copies of the daily prophet his stomach clenched and his throat tightened read it hermione harry choked out hermione glanced worriedly around her and then recited late saturday afternoon the small wizarding village of hogsmeade was attacked by a group of death eaters the attack coincided with a visit by hogwarts students into the small village an unconfirmed report states that several students were taken during the attack and many more injured several businesses were vandalized and worst of all fear has been struck into the very hearts of our world a glaring absence was noted on this dark saturday harry potter was not among the students visiting hogsmeade a coincidence perhaps not harry potter known by many as the boy who lived has a long history with death eaters and you know who once known to tell fantastical stories of battle and triumph against death eaters and even you know who harry potter has since faded from our front pages rumours indicated that the potter boy was involved with the affair concerning he who must not be named in june of this year in the ministry of magic however the ministry continues to be less than forthcoming with their information regarding this incident one must question what are they hiding could it be that the potter boy has allied himself with he who must not be named will the boy we believed to be our saviour bring forth our damnation did he orchestrate the ministry infiltration and the attack in hogsmeade it seems the potter boy lines may have crossed too many times with the dark lord for us to continue to overlook it perhaps it is time for the ministry to remove their rose coloured glasses and see the potter boy for who he really is the dark lord right hand man harry stared at hermione in disbelief tell me that you just made that up harry said his voice strained hermione shook her head her eyes wide with horror who wrote that harry spat grabbing the paper from hermione hand there no byline hermione stated numbly ron grabbed the paper from harry hands barking mad who going to believe this it the stupidest thing i ve ever heard harry swallowed hard as he stared blankly at the table he felt like laughing he felt like laughing hysterically in fact he probably would have laughed if he didntfeel like crying this is slander hermione stated they cantget away with this harry there are laws against writing such ludicrous unfounded unbelievable lies it bollocks ron stated shaking his head angrily hermione nodded they ll have to print a retraction such defamatory comments have to be taken seriously they ve disparaged you with absolutely no grounds for their statements we ll see to it that they pay for this harry harry rubbed his forehead they ve got away with it before not this bad but the damage is already done everyone will have read it everyone will think that i i harry squeezed his eyes against the nausea rising in his stomach the buzzing in the great hall had risen to an all time high a headache reminiscent of his days learning occlumency set in on harry he looked across the table at ron and hermione hopeful that they could say something anything to rebuke his statement they stared at him helplessly parvati sat on the cold dirt floor darkness surrounding her time was an elusive thing that had escaped her consciousness long ago she had no idea if it had been hours or days since she had spent the afternoon in hogsmeade she had given up trying to make sense of it all long ago she balanced on the edge of sanity a tightrope on which she carefully tread her mind tortured her with thoughts of freedom while the realistic part of her came to terms with the fact that she was not likely to ever experience freedom again she had fallen into fits of hysterical laughter as well as moments of frantic sobbing for the most part however she was silent she had come to realize where she was well not specifically where but who it was that was holding her captive this was the source of both her laughter and her tears the absurdity and the terror of it what on earth did he want with her slitted red eyes mocked her in the darkness the mental attacks left her feeling violated bereft and ill she knew he had perused her memories of her time with harry if she hadntbeen so terrified she would have been deeply embarrassed and highly affronted they were personal memories many that she had not even shared with lavender who did he think he was forcing her most private memories from her mind oh right he was voldemort parvati always shivered whenever she allowed the name to cross her mind parvati spent much of her time wrestling with her thoughts fragments of memories swam through her mind parts of a conversation she had overheard a woman by the name of erena a seer and a sacrifice parvati shuddered she was the sacrifice but what purpose would her sacrifice serve as she sifted through all of her memories of harry there was not anything she could think of that you know who would find of any interest she was a silly schoolgirl with a crush on the famous boy wizard much to her suffering ego harry had never divulged any of his secrets to her and even harder on her broken heart she knew that harry had not cared for her to the point that her kidnapping would cause harry bone crushing grief no she was not the girl harry loved that she knew sure harry would worry about her but no more than he would for seamus or lavender or any of the other students in their year save for ron and hermione of course but she really was not the ideal target to urge harry into doing something rash so why was she taken the grumbling of her stomach reminded parvati that her silent visitor would be coming soon the stranger had become her only source of hope they had never shared words he would slip in quietly and quickly leaving a small bowl of food and a pitcher of water he came twice a day and parvati wondered whether he had been ordered to be the one to keep her alive or if he was doing it on the sly parvati did not want to think of what a single death eater could do to her in her weakened and unarmed state but this death eater seemed different not that she had met many death eaters fear did not grip her body when he entered her dark room even though he appeared alarmingly tall against the bright light filtering into the room from behind him he did not wear a mask during his visits which also intrigued her though he did wear the long cloak of you know who servants he always made sure to keep his face in the shadows the light reflecting off his smooth bald head and glinting off his single hoop earring parvati positioned herself near the door perhaps today would be the day that he spoke to her it had seemed unlikely at breakfast that morning that the day could get any worse for harry but as harry was the king of unlikely happenings the day became progressively worse harry had expected the whispers from fellow students he had expected the glares from those who believed the ridiculous drivel spouted in the daily prophet he had expected the sneers and smirks from slytherins led by malfoy who alone seemed to appreciate how farfetched the claim was that harry was in league with voldemort he had not expected his own housemates to turn on him he had not expected ginny to leave the great hall without a backwards glance he had not expected his first lesson to end with madam sprout shrinking back in fear as harry tried to hand her his completed assignment on the healing properties of fuchsia fanged ferns harry dropped the parchment on her desk and left the greenhouse feeling lower than he ever had in his life defense against the dark arts was no better while professor pandoran hadntshrank away from him in fear or disgust she did use him as a guinea pig to demonstrate a new disarming spell after harry had been hit with the spell several times pandoran had instructed harry to use a shield to block her next attempt harry didntknow if he was simply tired of being knocked off his feet or whether his frustration of his current situation had been too much but his shield had been a tad excessive pandoran had warned him in their private training sessions that it would be wise for harry to keep his defensive progress unknown to others he had become incredibly powerful but had agreed to keep his growing power under wraps even from his friends however with one simple shield charm harry demonstrated to his classmates that with a lazy flick of his wrist and a silent incantation he could create a shield charm so powerful that his assailant or in this case his professor was sent flying clear across the room as her own spell reflected on her with impressive force professor pandoran fractured her wrist as a result of her shield induced flight the students filed out of the classroom staring at harry in horror pandoran had suggested to harry as he walked her to the hospital wing that they cancel his training session that night during transfiguration harry stared morosely at the empty chair beside him pushing aside his thoughts of poor professor pandoran and allowing them to drift to parvati where was she was she all right was she alive the empty chair mocked harry heightening his loneliness frustration and anger he did not take in a word of professor mcgonagall lecture he doodled on the parchment spread before him not noticing when the students around him began to leave their desks harry harry rose his eyes from the intricate lines he had been tracing on his page to meet hermione concerned stare huh harry replied harry our lesson is over hermione said quietly harry stared at her she was nibbling her lip worriedly she seemed beside herself not knowing how to fix this particular problem he glanced to the towering figure beside her and met his best mate worried gaze harry sighed and rose from his stool clearing the items on his desk into his bag i not up for lunch harry mumbled dejectedly i think i ll just go to the dormitory hermione and ron exchanged helpless glances you need to eat harry hermione urged you hardly had a bite at breakfast harry shook his head i not hungry ron put his hand on harry shoulder and gripped it hard you re not going to do this harry i wontlet you harry stared at ron in surprise sorry ron steered harry down the corridor in the direction of the great hall you re not going to go to the dormitory and brood you re not going to make yourself sick over something out of your control you re not going to push us away harry rolled his eyes i wasntgoing to i just not hungry then donteat ron replied but you re still coming with us harry was torn between being irritated and being touched by ron concern he turned and looked his mate in the eye determined blue eyes blazed into harry he sighed thanks mate ron grinned and slapped harry on the back anytime hermione threw her arms around both boys before either knew what was happening she pulled away with a teary grin let go ron and harry exchanged amused grins and followed hermione to the great hall harry knew that no matter what happened he would always have ron and hermione parvati ears perked up as the sound of feet shuffling towards her grew louder her stomach grumbled in anticipation it had seemed as though it had been longer than usual since her silent visitor had brought her rations her throat was incredibly dry and her lips were chapped and cracked if she had to she would even forego the food just to get some water she was feeling incredibly weak and was slipping out of consciousness more often then she d like to admit she raised her trembling fingers and absently smoothed her fraying plait the door burst open breaking the lock to pieces parvati gasped in shock she squinted against the bright light and felt her stomach sink as the realization that the hulking man entering her prison was not her silent visitor no this man was much shorter and nearly twice as thick and he was not alone parvati pressed herself against the wall fear gripping her insides the second man stood in the doorway blocking much of the light from entering the small cell he was tall but not as tall as her visitor in the dim light parvati could see that both men were wearing death eater masks making themselves anonymous to her and possibly to each other get over here the first death eater snarled grabbing parvati by her elbow and jerking her towards him parvati held her breath as he leaned toward her peering into her face so pretty he slurred and parvati nearly choked on the smell of firewhiskey oozing from him he raised his other hand to her cheek tracing his finger along her cheek parvati jerked her head away fighting the urge to vomit her movement was rewarded with a backhand across her face cheek burning parvati raised her chin in defiance and glared into the mask before her we re not to harm her the second death eater said though there was little conviction to his voice the squat death eater snorted and shoved parvati towards the door you re not worth my master protection but i will abide by his wishes parvati stumbled through the door as the second death eater moved into the dim corridor she was being protected this revelation did not give parvati comfort quite the contrary if she was being protected that meant that he still wanted something from her fear tightened its icy grip on her she was led along the same path as her last venture out of her prison down the damp dimly lit corridor and up the rickety staircase leading to a doorway this time however the doorway was not flanked with dementors parvati felt an icy chill nonetheless beyond that door was the sitting room where he had attacked her was she being brought back for another assault what more could he take from her that he hadnttaken already parvati shuddered at the thought she followed the taller of her two escorts up the staircase while the other followed her shoving her occasionally in amusement she silently prayed that if she were going to be killed it would be quick and painless she knew she was not scared of death but she was scared of him she was led into the sitting room where she had first seen the slits that held red eyes this time however a small group of death eaters stood in a small circle and he was nowhere to be seen apparently the orders had already been given their conversation came to an abrupt stop as she entered the room and all masked faces turned to face her parvati stood before them her heart pounding in her chest why were there so many of them what were they going to do to her parvati took a deep breath and steeled herself she would not let them make a fool of her she may be defenseless but she still had her dignity it time parvati watched as all but two of the death eaters encircling her disapparated the two masked figures studied her silently parvati stood still willing her fear not to show she could tell by their builds that neither of her companions were her silent visitor she wondered if he had been in the group that disapparated if he was part of the plan maybe there was still hope parvati realized she had no reason to put her trust in her visitor for all she knew he was simply following orders but he did not try to intimidate her like the others he did not take advantage of the situation to demonstrate how much power he had over her instead his presence was always calming and for parvati that was all she had several minutes passed with neither parvati nor the death eaters moving even though she could not see their faces parvati could feel their cold hard stares she held her chin up proudly with her hands clasped behind her back her stomach continued to rumble loudly almost seeming to echo in the silence of the room her mouth was still incredibly dry and she was almost desperate enough to ask for water she refrained however knowing that if she were to utter a word she d be hexed before the sound fell from her lips so she stood silently fighting the weakness and dizziness that was taking over her body the death eaters seemed to grow restless as the minutes passed the taller of the two took to pacing in front of the fireplace the shorter fidgeted by straightening his robes and polishing his wand with his sleeve parvati remained unmoving not wanting to draw any attention to herself a flash of green sparks in the fireplace seemed to be what they were waiting for the taller death eater pulled a rusted teakettle from the depths of his robe and held it toward parvati take hold he ordered parvati knew that one way or another she would be traveling by that portkey and any attempt to resist was futile she stepped forward her hand trembling as she wrapped her fingers around the spout the shorter death eater placed a hand on the belly of the kettle three two one vibrant colours and a gust of wind assaulted parvati senses she squeezed her eyes shut fighting the increasing nausea and dizziness she tried to push away the terror building inside her the unknown was too much she didntknow where they were going nor what purpose she would serve his words echoed in her mind suitable sacrifice was she being led to her death would they torture her would they parvati stopped herself hoping that her mind was imagining things much worse than what reality would bring parvati and her fellow travelers landed with a resounding crash in a dark musty room the death eaters righted themselves quickly and lit their wands revealing what seemed to be a storage room boxes of different shapes and sizes lined the walls from floor to ceiling they were alone in this cramped room but muffled voices could be heard filtering through the doorway at the far end of the room parvati strained to make out what they were saying but it was of no use she remained slumped against the wall of boxes under the careful watch of her masked companions the muffled voices stopped parvati swore she heard a distant tinkling of bells like those often heard above shop doors in hogsmeade or diagon alley her suspicions were quickly confirmed as the storage room door was pushed open parvati heart jumped into her throat as a slight witch with frizzy blonde hair stepped into the back room hope swelled inside parvati as she recognized the shop owner of navigating nostradamus they had shared such a lovely conversation surely once she recognized parvati the kind witch would do anything she could to help parvati she pushed herself to her feet a hopeful smile twitching the corners of her mouth erena greeted the taller death eater parvati eyes darted to him the blonde witch nodded in greeting they re waiting for you downstairs no no no parvati shook her head as tears welled in her eyes the hope inside her shriveled to despair erena parvati remembered him saying that name parvati felt sick as she realized this witch had been part of the plan all along she had befriended parvati setting the trap for her kidnapping but why parvati stared hopelessly at erena who was avoiding looking in parvati direction the death eaters grabbed parvati arms and steered her to a trapdoor she had not noticed before as the shorter death eater stooped to raise the door parvati glanced one last time at erena a final flare of hope igniting within her she nearly gasped as she stared into erena eyes they were dark and empty erena seemed to be caught in a void unknowing and unfeeling the blank look in the older woman eyes sent a chill through parvati they held each other gaze for several seconds before erena turned on her heel and disappeared through the storage room door parvati swallowed hard she had no one she was alone any possibility of a future lay in the room below fear swelled within her as she began the descent to her fate a n2 i really struggled with this last section please let me know what you think by clicking on that lovely review button and leaving a word or two a n to my mugglenet and fanfiction fans if you are in fact reading this it means you ve stuck with me despite my five month absence you rock a special thanks to lurid femme biggerstaff15 pottersmuse and awful for reminding me why i do this enjoy chapter 27 resolution monday afternoon fared better for harry ron and hermione had lightened his mood considerably during lunch with them by his side he was better able to ignore the actions of everyone else around him during charms he was able to focus on professor flitwick demonstration and master the new complex charm quicker than even hermione he thought he heard a classmate whisper something about him using dark magic but he decidedly ignored it even double potions had been rather uneventful snape had studied harry with mild curiosity rather than hate by the end of the lesson harry had procured a decent potion earning an overdue sneer from the professor all in all afternoon classes were a fair improvement over the morning after their final lesson for the day harry followed ron and hermione into the common room he had listened half heartedly to ron incessant chatter about their upcoming quidditch practice while harry usually enjoyed listening to the strategies that ron came up with harry heart just wasntin it all he wanted was to mount his firebolt and chase the tension from his body as the wind whipped around him he could care less about formations and practice drills though he would never admit that to ron as the fat lady portrait swung shut behind harry the sound of angry voices met his ears he peered around ron and saw ginny and dean squared off harry tried to squash the feeling of glee that had erupted inside him he really shouldntbe happy that his friend was obviously upset really he shouldn t but the fact that she was angry at the great git well harry couldnthelp but feel pleased about that he stepped beside ron who along with hermione had frozen in their tracks unnoticed by the bickering duo dean i do not need to explain myself i ve told you how i feel about this ginny ginny planted her hands on her hips and i ve told you that you re being completely unreasonable i your boyfriend i think i ve got a right maybe you should have reminded yourself of that status before you went off to hogsmeade without me dean rolled his eyes dontbring that up again ginny eyes flashed then stop being such a hypocrite it hardly the same thing it exactly the same thing you just refuse to see it that way i ve tried to meet you half way dean i think i ve done more than enough dean shook his head you re blind to the truth ginny eyes narrowed and her voice was low and threatening i am no such thing if that what you think then you dontknow me at all how am i supposed to know you when you spend most of your time with them who my friends you cantexpect me to chuck them out of my life dean groaned that not what i asking really because it seems as though you re giving me an ultimatum you re making me choose between you and them no i not ginny rolled her eyes for merlin sake dean you talk about me being blind meanwhile you ve got your head so far up your arse you cantsee what right in front of you get over yourself dean clenched his fists at his side this is pointless i refuse to talk to you when you re like this ginny held her hands out to her side like what honest dean shook his head and turned around noticing harry ron and hermione for the first time he glared at them enjoying the show ron harry and hermione stared at dean speechless dean glanced at ginny who was red faced though whether it was from embarrassment or anger was uncertain dean shoved his way between ron and harry and climbed through the portrait hole well ron harry and hermione turned to look at ginny questioningly her hands were on her hips and her eyes were narrowed in anger well what ron replied ginny crossed her arms did you enjoy the show hermione shook her head and stepped hesitantly toward ginny we re sorry ginny ginny glared daggers the courteous thing would have been to let us know you were here that was a private conversation of course you re right ginny hermione replied placatingly we should have said something ron stepped forward his eyes narrowing has he done something to hurt you ginny ginny face flushed with fury what is it with you boys who think i cantthink or take care of myself i dontneed you telling me what to do when to do it or how i should behave i wish you would all just sod off ginny glared at ron who stood with his mouth agape she turned her gaze to harry his heart fluttered this was the closest he had been to her in days and he was amazed at how pretty she looked even in her anger her eyes flickered a flash of hurt shadowing her features ginny turned and stomped up the staircase to the girls dormitory harry felt bereft what did i say ron asked in confusion oh ron hermione sighed she embarrassed that we witnessed her fight with dean your big brother instincts are not what she needs right now if that git has done anything ron began you ll let ginny handle it hermione interrupted ron frowned hermione placed her hand on his arm she ll come to you if she needs you ron ron glanced at harry who had remained motionless harry had been missing ginny so much over the last few days and their brief encounter made the ache worse he felt bad that ginny was so upset and guilt spread through him for having been pleased that she and dean were fighting as much as he wanted ginny for himself she wasnthis if he had been a true friend he would have been more worried about her feelings than his own she was hurting and he was selfish he was giving dean a run for the title of great git harry mumbled incoherently to ron and hermione before trudging up the staircase to his dormitory he tossed his bag on the floor beside his trunk his attention was drawn to the hangings around his bed they were closed he glanced at the other beds in the room wondering if the house elves had decided on a new routine all of the other hangings were tied open harry brows furrowed together in confusion he raised his hand hesitantly to the heavy hangings thinking he d rather be safe than sorry he drew his wand with his right hand as his left hand pulled the heavy fabric aside he quickly scanned his bed and gasped in surprise propped up against his pillow was a stuffed green dragon harry crawled onto his bed and pulled the hangings closed this was no ordinary stuffed dragon this particular dragon belonged to one ginny weasley harry recognized it immediately as the dragon she had won on his birthday at the amusement park harry picked it up and smiled a pleasant warmth spread through him as he remembered her excitement and the way she had laughed at the silly muggle games he noticed a small roll of parchment tucked into its collar he grabbed the note and unrolled it finding ginny slanted handwriting inside norbert has been worried about you i ve agreed to let him stay with you so he can keep an eye on you he promised to behave let it be known that he will report to me should he feel you are a brooding b feeling unwarranted guilt or c keeping company with undeserving girls he understands your need for being macho so he will not be insulted should you decide to hide him in your trunk but please dontforget about him he really does care even if he hasntbeen around yours ginny harry could not stop the grin that spread across his face he reread the letter quickly chuckling softly he stared at the last two words yours ginny harry sighed as he fell back against his pillows if only she was his but no she belonged to the stupid prat that she had just been bellowing at what had they been arguing about they had both certainly been angry it really wasnthis business but he couldnthelp but worry about ginny he hoped that dean hadnt done anything to hurt her ron usually jumped to conclusions when it came to protecting his baby sister and harry hoped that was the case this time harry twisted and tucked norbert under his pillows the last thing he needed was ron yanking open his bed hangings to find harry clutching a stuffed dragon belonging to his best mate sister harry wasntsure ron would recognize the dragon but it wasntworth the risk ginny gesture was innocent in nature but harry wasntsure how ron would react what would dean do if he knew harry mused he shook his head he didntthink dean would take kindly to his girlfriend leaving one of her prized possessions for harry innocent or not harry yanked his hangings open and jumped from his bed he began to get ready for practice his mind raced as he moved about the dormitory while he still hadntspoken to ginny she had made a point to show him that she was still there for him she was obviously having problems of her own harry remembered parvati telling him that ginny wasnthappy with dean is that what had preoccupied her lately was she trying to patch things up with the great git whatever the reason for her absence the presence of norbert had lifted harry spirits considerably he grabbed his firebolt and bounded from the room a few extra laps before practice was just the thing he needed to clear his head parvati steps were slow and hesitant the sound of her heart pounded noisily in her head the staircase was dimly lit she could only see a few steps in front of her no sound reached her from below she knew there were people waiting down there for her erena had said so but who more death eaters if it was more death eaters why did they need to bring her here couldntthey do whatever they were planning to do to her in the prison in which she had been kept why did they have to come back here to the store where the kidnapping had been orchestrated what purpose did this place serve parvati shook her head realizing it was very unlikely that she would ever find the answers to her questions her feet found the bottom step far too soon in front of her and to her left were blank concrete walls a dark hallway ran towards a room on her right light spilled through the doorway lighting the far end of the hallway with no other option parvati tried to steady her breathing and prayed silently this was it this was where she was going to live or die she would not give up she would fight until the end she was not a coward she straightened her back and raised her jaw in determination she walked towards the room fighting the demons in her mind that weakened her resolve the hallway was not long she reached her destination quickly and stepped boldly into the brightly lit room parvati eyes scanned the room it was empty except for the small group of death eaters gathered in front of a large fireplace they turned as one to look at her in silence one masked figure strode to her swiftly grabbed her by the arm and yanked her to the far side of the room it was then that she noticed the chains on the walls she fought against the panic that filled her belly what kind of shop had a basement that looked like it had once held prisoners or worse tortured victims she couldnthelp but stare at the manacles horrible terrifying thoughts spun threw her mind what did wizards need shackles for werenthexes and jinxes enough especially hexes of the dark magic kind of which she fully expected these death eaters to be well trained she was helpless why would they need to restrain her parvati was pulled by her thoughts when rather than being shackled she was shoved to the floor she fell to her knees wincing as her kneecaps made contact with the cold concrete floor she felt the palms of her hands burn from catching her fall she looked up at the faceless figure hovering over her why am i here she asked foolishly she was answered with a backhand across the face she yelped her cheek feeling as though it had been broken open the force of the hit threw her body against the wall she sat slumped against it touching her cheek tenderly she winced and scowled at the menace before her she learned from her mistake however and kept her mouth shut more waiting parvati was really starting to think that you know who was the most unorganized wizard of all time she was tired of being taken from place to place only to sit and wait why dontthey get on with it already she was sick of waiting waiting for a signal waiting for word waiting for him waiting for death she could sense the same restlessness in the death eaters they however seemed to be waiting excitedly they were anticipating the next move they were eager they were ready the orange flames in the fireplace suddenly became bright green parvati leaned to the side curious to see around the bodies blocking her view suddenly a spindly figure appeared spinning tightly before thin arms flew out to steady its arrival the figure was draped in a thick shawl and several bracelets dangled from both wrists thin frail fingers clutched tightly protectively to the shawl as the eyes of sybill trelawney widened in shock parvati gasped hope surged through parvati had they sent for professor trelawney to take her back to hogwarts were they letting her go professor professor trelawney eyes darted to the crumpled figure on the floor her eyes became impossibly wider miss patil what are you we ve been so worried why are there where erena trelawney whispy voice trembled as she tried to make sense of the situation before her parvati felt her throat constrict her eyes burned this wasntright if trelawney had been sent to get her surely parvati presence wouldnthave been so unexpected instead she was looking for erena the traitor panic gripped parvati insides once again professor it a trap get out of here erena one of them parvati yelled desperately professor trelawney eyed the death eaters that seemed to be closing in on her she glanced hesitantly to the doorway erena she called silence erena she called desperately she wontcome a tall thick death eater replied menacingly professor trelawney large eyes turned to the death eater that had spoken her fingers clutched her shawl protectively erena asked me to come she stated faintly she said she needed advice i sure she did the death eater said an air of arrogance in his voice parvati watched helplessly she wondered why you know who would have drawn professor trelawney into this mess it was strange really to see her professor outside of her tower professor trelawney had always seemed so knowledgeable and awe worthy but here in the dank basement of an unassuming hogsmeade shop professor trelawney looked very small and feeble professor trelawney eyes darted from the death eaters to the fireplace parvati could read her professor mind as easily as any legilimens as could the death eaters who quickly blocked the path from trelawney to the fireplace their movement consequently opened a pathway for trelawney to parvati with a quick glance at the surrounding death eaters professor trelawney scurried across the short distance to her prized pupil have you seen erena professor trelawney whispered kneeling beside parvati parvati swallowed a sob and tried to ignore the burning behind her eyes professor trelawney was still under the delusion that erena would help them parvati looked at trelawney despairingly i told you she one of them she helped them take me and bring me down here parvati said her voice strained professor trelawney shook her head dismissively erena would never be involved with them i saw her she told them to bring me down here parvati exclaimed desperate for professor trelawney to comprehend the danger they were in professor trelawney would not listen to reason she closed her eyes breathing deeply no she does not have the aura of a traitor i know her well never have i detected any darkness in my readings or crystal gazing parvati wanted to grab professor trelawney shoulders to shake some sense into her death eaters surrounded them whether or not professor trelawney had seen anything in regards to erena indeed it would have been helpful had the professor seen danger before parvati had stepped foot in hogsmeade but reminiscing about past ruminations in her north tower would not take professor trelawney or parvati from this room parvati glanced at the death eaters they had not moved from their positions after trelawney had crossed the room parvati lowered her voice to a bare whisper professor do you have your wand excellent question miss patil parvati stomach dropped as she recognized the high cold voice that had spoke to her she dragged her eyes to the ominous red eyes that appeared as the crowd of death eaters parted and bowed to him professor trelawney gasped and clutched parvati arm tightly voldemort leading an additional group of death eaters strode into the small room he smiled menacingly at parvati making her stomach turn uneasily she felt a cold eerie chill run down her spine and shivered under his gaze perhaps i need to acquire young girls to do my bidding since none of you thought to disarm the professor voldemort sneered glaring at his followers he waved his wand half heartedly causing professor trelawney wand to fly from her robes and into his hand surely i do not need the girl to restrain the professor two death eaters darted forward and yanked professor trelawney to her feet with sickening dread parvati watched as her professor was forced into the manacles hanging from the wall professor trelawney arms were stretched awkwardly above her head her eyes darted to voldemort parvati could see her professor trembling as she stared in horror at the sight of the dark lord i demand you let us go professor trelawney shrieked her voice laced with fear voldemort eyed trelawney with amusement he then broke into a cold unnatural laugh you are in no position to make demands you stupid fool he stated plainly professor trelawney seemed to shrivel under his glare yet still she persisted let my pupil go voldemort strode across the room peering threateningly into trelawney face did you not hear me he hissed let her go professor trelawney whispered parvati shook her head in horror what was professor trelawney thinking apparently your hearing is as foggy as your crystal ball voldemort stated plainly he turned to one of the death eaters that had arrived with him and nodded crucio in the next instant a scream tore from parvati throat as pain like she had never felt before coursed through her body she felt like she was on fire and like she was freezing like she was being cut and torn apart as though her muscles were trying to rip themselves apart and her bones were being shattered to splinters and then it stopped the cries of professor trelawney met parvati ears she just a girl leave her alone crucio the pain returned parvati was sure she was going to die surely only death could cause this much pain tears streaked her face as the curse was lifted she lay on the floor panting professor trelawney struggled against her restraints she had closed her eyes to the horror she had been made to witness but could not stop sound from reaching her ears when the screaming stopped she opened her eyes and stared at the crippled figure on the floor parvati lay curled in the fetal position her body trembling what do you want professor trelawney asked her voice barely a whisper voldemort grinned menacingly your cooperation professor trelawney glanced at parvati curled body on the floor their eyes met and parvati pled silently trelawney took a deep breath and nodded voldemort turned and nodded at his followers all but four disapparated leaving the setting much more intimate and frightening one death eater stood with his wand trained on parvati another with a wand trained on trelawney the third walked to the door and stood guard while the fourth stood beside voldemort administer the potion bella voldemort voice was low and commanding the death eater at his side stepped forward obediently the click clack of heeled boots echoed throughout the concrete room parvati watched the death eater lower her mask as she stepped in front of professor trelawney i prefer my victims to see their enemy the death eater called bella hissed into trelawney wan face lestrange professor trelawney whispered in fear bella laughed throwing her head back in glee parvati stomach coiled there was nothing kind in that taunting laugh open wide bella said in a sing song voice raising a vial from her robe pocket what is it before the words had left trelawney mouth the death eater watching over parvati cried crucio parvati body convulsed on the floor the pain slicing through her body she prayed for it to stop prayed for the ache to end prayed for death the curse was lifted and the ringing of bella squeals of delight reverberated off the stone walls any more questions bella sneered in trelawney face professor trelawney shook her head her face white and wet with tears parvati lay gasping on the floor her breathing uneven trelawney knew if parvati survived this she would never be the same bella clutched the back of trelawney head pulling at her hair roughly and tilting her head back professor trelawney knew any resistance would result in more torture for parvati so she opened her mouth taking the liquid in bella jabbed her wand under trelawney jaw forcing her mouth closed trelawney swallowed her fate sealed as the potion burned down her throat harry scanned the quidditch pitch finding it empty he sighed in relief as much as it annoyed his friends particularly hermione harry truly liked finding time for himself he needed time to sort through his thoughts work through his problems and contemplate his fate sure it may be considered brooding by most people but honestly what was the big deal he wasnthurting anyone he wasntsnubbing his friends though he knew they often felt that way he just needed time alone and he had found it he jumped on his broom and took to the sky immediately the burdens of his life became momentarily a distant memory harry set to zigzagging across the pitch throwing in a wronski feint or sloth grip roll now and again for good measure his heart pounding and sweat trickling down his back he was oblivious to his teammates beginning to gather below him a scream of outrage from ron finally drew harry attention ron seemed to be hacked off at katie bell as he stood bellowing in her face harry directed his firebolt toward the group curious to ron behaviour he landed a few feet away and began to walk toward ron katie dennis jack and andrew he wondered where ginny was did you tell her that attending quidditch practice isntan option ron cried katie shrugged i told her that you d be upset if she wasnthere and what did she say katie face reddened i wontrepeat what she said you could do to yourself ron face burned in anger who the bloody hell does she think she is does she think just because she my sister she can get away with this no bloody way if she cantmake it to practice then i ll find someone else who takes this game more seriously ginny wasntcoming to practice harry couldntbelieve it ginny never missed practice she was usually the first one there and the last to leave what was going on katie shrugged she wouldntbudge i tried to convince her i think throwing her off the team might be a bit extreme though we all have our off days ron shook his head that no excuse we re a team and we work and practice as a team if i let her off the hook then it gives everyone else a right to skip practice i wonthave it ron exclaimed his eyes flashing madly we re already wasting time sloper kirke get your arses on your brooms what are you waiting for jack and andrew jumped onto their brooms obediently and took to the sky ron then rounded on dennis and katie you two there no reason you cantstart without her this will be a good way to practice two person formations in case one of the chasers is injured during play ron said he watched as they mounted their brooms and soared to the center of the pitch before turning to harry harry go back to the dormitory and get ginny i dontcare what her excuse is she needs to be here harry squirmed uncomfortably ron he began quietly you saw how upset ginny was why dontyou give her a break ron shook his head his eyes blazing that exactly why she needs to be up here she not doing herself any good by crying into her pillow if you care at all about her harry you ll go get her harry glared at ron of course i care about her but then go get her ron interrupted i cantgo into the girls dormitory harry argued trying a different tack so find someone who bloody well can ron exclaimed you re the bloody boy who lived i sure you can figure out a way to get a girl out of her dormitory and if you see dean give him a kick in the shins for whatever he did to my sister that wontbe necessary ron and harry spun on their heels to see ginny marching towards them with her broom in hand i could hear you screaming all the way to the castle ginny exclaimed sending ron a death glare do you have to be such a prat you re late ron said mirroring her glare i here now captain katie and creevey are already up there ron said you can go apologize to them for being late ginny stuck her tongue out at ron and straddled her broom she darted a glance at harry and then kicked off from the ground harry turned to ron you really can be a sodding prat mate ron shrugged i her big brother it my job they grinned at each other before kicking off and joining practice parvati watched in horror as professor trelawney swallowed the potion that had been poured into her mouth a profound sense of foreboding drenched the still air in the room the satisfied smirk on voldemort face mixed with the girlish glee on bella only saturated the sense of dread within parvati further professor trelawney squeezed her eyes shut and begun coughing and gasping desperately as if she were being choked she struggled against her restraints her body shaking violently as the potion seeped through her body parvati sat frozen in terror is it working master bella whispered in excited awe quiet voldemort hissed bella cowered slightly and bowed her head in submission professor trelawney body suddenly stilled and her breathing evened out her legs gave out leaving her hanging like a rag doll from the manacles chained to the wall if trelawney eyes had not been open parvati would have thought her asleep voldemort eyes gleamed he whispered in excitement excellent it just as i had hoped if everything goes as planned it will have indeed been worth spilling my own blood for the potion voldemort walked towards trelawney raising his wand professor trelawney head rose her eyes wide open and captured in voldemort gaze yes i see voldemort whispered his eyes narrowed deep in concentration he stepped closer i see where it hidden he murmured the death eaters in the room watched with intrigue forgetting their watchful duty including the death eater by the door who walked forward slowly in awe of his master voldemort closed his eyes his wand drawing intricate patterns in the air in front of him parvati watched his mouth working the silent incantations what on earth was it that professor trelawney would be privy to that would make her a target of voldemort s was it really professor trelawney that voldemort had been after all this time was parvati just a pawn and trelawney the king that voldemort wanted trapped that made less sense to parvati than her own capture had professor trelawney whimpered in place of the blank gaze that had reflected in her eyes was a look of shock and fear it seemed as though she were trying to tear her eyes away from voldemort but was powerless to do so a distant sound drew parvati attention away from the spectacle before her she stared at the open doorway for a flicker of a moment she swore she had seen a shadow pass through the doorway the open doorway parvati glanced back to the death eaters they were completely engrossed in watching their lord perform his sick twisted magic parvati looked back at the door her path was clear if she moved slowly maybe she could get out and find help for professor trelawney before the death eaters noticed her absence the thought of erena waiting upstairs caused parvati to hesitate another strangled whimper from trelawney emboldened parvati with a last glance at her captors she began to slowly and quietly crawl to the door merlin she wished she were closer her knees ached from being thrown to the floor earlier her hands were raw with cuts and scrapes her muscles screamed at her in protest reminding her of being under the cruciatus but she plowed on one step another step and another she dared not glance behind her the extra movement may just be that which would give her away inch by inch she moved her breathing was shallow but her heart beat madly she could very well be performing the act that would seal her death but she had waited for death long enough she was going to take this chance she had to the staccato whimpers of trelawney echoed in the room slicing through the heavy air the death eaters remained silent and motionless beside voldemort his wand moved gracefully in beautiful arcs belying the evil spells the movements cast parvati eyes were locked on the doorway she moved closer closer closer she paused and shook her head her eyesight was failing her the image of the doorway seemed to shiver and then become still shiver and still time and time again she was finally losing it after all she had been through it really shouldnthave been a surprise added to her botched eyesight was her addled hearing she strained her ears certain she could hear soft footsteps and there that was certainly the rustling of robes she chanced a glance behind her nobody had moved what on earth was going on voldemort voice broke the silence yes he cried triumphant nearly there his eyes shot open his red gaze glowing venomously his wand stilled and then flicked with fervor as he cried invoco memorae what happened next would become a blur in parvati memory a cacophony of curses and hexes reverberated off the walls from invisible assailants causing the death eaters to duck and cast shields they whirled around protecting their master whose fury was palpable the glow of his eyes made the former hue pale in comparison you ingrates voldemort screamed is this the protection you offer me he grabbed bella pressing his finger to the inside of her wrist she winced but maintained a fiendish gleam in her eye among the blazing streaks of red green purple and blue hexes flying through the air was a series of resounding cracks as death eater after death eater apparated into the room i want them both brought back to me cried voldemort in anger if my plans are foiled whoever is responsible will pay dearly he then turned and disapparated coward parvati thought silently she looked around the room crouching close to the ground she realized the blur of movement she had seen by the door had been the invisible assailants that were now attacking the death eaters with a vengeance as she scanned the room she could catch glimpses of blurred movement among the death eaters it was impossible to tell who was winning the battle parvati assumed the assailants were aurors but it was unclear how many there were she wouldnthave minded joining the fray herself but without a wand she knew any effort on her part would be futile she looked behind her and saw a clear path to the doorway turning and looking to the back wall she saw professor trelawney hanging limply her eyes now closed parvati swallowed a lump forming in her throat is she dead parvati wondered her stomach twisting painfully without a wand how was she supposed to unclasp the shackles imprisoning her professor and even if parvati could remove the manacles how would she manage to carry an unconscious body undetected but shouldntshe at least try would she be able to live with herself if she knew that she had left professor trelawney unconscious and defenseless surrounded by death eaters parvati cursed silently it was an impossible situation either go alone and live with guilt or try to take professor trelawney and get killed for surely she would not be able to go unnoticed the longer she sat and contemplated the less likely that either option would lead to a successful escape parvati looked at her favourite professor her heart twisting painfully her eyes burned as she bid a silent farewell before turning and pushing herself to her feet she took only one step before her legs gave out underneath her the sting of a hex vibrated through her body she pushed herself to her knees determined she crawled forward only to be hit by a body binding curse she fell with a thud to the floor whoever had attacked must have been satisfied for she was left lying frozen on the floor she was uncertain how long she laid there staring at the blank cold wall the sound of shrieks and hexes whizzed around her her heart continued its incessant pounding in her head suddenly she felt her body relax the curse had been lifted parvati pushed herself to her knees once again she did not look back she began crawling forward desperate to try until the end one two three inches further the sound of conflict ensued battling for dominance with the pounding of parvati heart she was so close she was nearly there she was going to parvati yelped as her body was raised into the air and then thrown forcefully against the wall pain shot through her body her head cracking against the wall she fell to the ground gasping for breath you re mine pretty one parvati squeezed her eyes shut recognizing the voice of the death eater that had come to her cell his breath laced with firewhiskey she wanted to move was desperate to run she opened her eyes to find him looming over her he smiled with sickening pleasure parvati silently begged for death his eyes roamed over her broken body and parvati was sure she had never felt more violated in her life oh yes i will make you mine he sneered lowering his head to whisper in her ear parvati whimpered tears trailed down her face this was it there was no hope please she whispered please just kill me he laughed a deep throated toe curling laugh dontworry my pretty you ll be killed but not until the dark lord is through with you and if i lucky i ll have my opportunity to say goodbye parvati cried and shook her head the pain coursing through her body was too much she wouldntlet him do this to her she didntdeserve to die at his hands there had to be more for her than this help she cried out her voice was little more than a loud whisper his hand hit her face with force driving the back of her head into the wall once again she felt the sickening wet warmth of blood soaking her hair with each pound of her heart her head thudded in agony she swallowed and took a deep breath help the death eater went for her neck this time squeezing her throat with all his might a litany of curses fell from his mouth his eyes burned with fury and parvati knew that she was dying and she felt at peace she closed her eyes all sound fell away in her mind eye she pictured her family she pictured her school friends she pictured harry the pictures began to fade to darkness she felt herself sliding gliding floating parvati gasped and her eyes shot open she took in a painful gulp of air the death eater lay crumpled on top of her he must have been hexed parvati eyes darted around she couldntsee anything around his bulk she tried to push his body off her but her muscles wouldntcooperate she tried to roll away but found herself too close to the wall she fought to breathe each inhale causing a sharp pain in her side a hooded figure appeared over her her momentary hope dissipated when she saw the mask of a death eater the limp body was pulled off her and shoved with distaste to the side the death eater glanced around before squatting down in front of her miss patil i here to help you you must trust me parvati stared at the masked figure in front of her in confusion the death eater glanced around quickly again i the one who brought you food and water if you ll let me i can get you out of here parvati heart flooded with hope she allowed the tears to fall as she nodded we ll do a side along apparition i can take you as far as the gates at hogwarts someone will come for you there parvati nodded to show her understanding she allowed herself to be lifted into his arms every inch of her body protested to being moved but she ignored it with a quick turn she felt the odd sensation she recalled from apparating with her father as a child as she and her silent visitor disapparated from the dark hateful basement with a pop they appeared outside the hogwarts gates the death eater lowered her gently to the ground i sorry i cantstay he said as he straightened but i need to return before my absence is noted parvati watched as the death eater turned toward the castle he waved his wand emitting a silver blaze that raced toward the castle he turned and kneeled beside her someone from the school will be here for you shortly he said softly he paused and then said i sorry you had to endure so much i sorry i couldnthave done more parvati smiled weakly you saved me he nodded and pushed himself to his feet goodbye miss patil he then turned and disapparated harry was beginning to think it had been a terrible idea to allow ginny to practice never mind force her into it she had been completely reckless the entire practice not only was she pulling daring stunts she was endangering the other teammates ron had shouted at her to the extent that his voice was hoarse it was a tough and grueling practice everyone was dead tired their muscles aching and their uniforms soaked with sweat despite ginny behaviour it had been a good practice the team maneuvered flawlessly they had established a form of silent communication reading each other effortlessly and orchestrating plays that no other team at hogwarts would have thought possible harry descended to the ground slowly he was worried about ginny but wasntsure what to do about it she hadntspoken to him in days and had barely spared him a glance all practice he couldntstand this weird silence that had settled over their friendship and he was determined to put an end to it harry landed spotting ginny and katie making their trek back to the castle he saw kirke and sloper helping ron put the equipment away so harry decided that now was the time to act he jogged towards the girls falling into step beside them good practice yeah he commented katie groaned if good means back breaking then yes good practice harry nodded and glanced at ginny she stared at the ground in front of her you seemed to work particular hard gin he commented trying to draw her out keeping her eyes trained on the grass in front of her ginny shrugged and said i s pose they walked a few steps in silence ginny was not making this easy well harry wasntgoing to let her get away with it listen ginny can we talk ginny stopped planting a fist on her hip harry i am in no mood for a big brother talk harry stopped squaring his shoulders for battle first of all i not your brother second i need to talk to you about norbert ginny face flushed in embarrassment and her eyes dropped to the ground katie feeling as though she were intruding waved awkwardly and jogged away leaving harry and ginny alone harry stepped toward ginny hesitantly will you talk to me he asked softly ginny raised her eyes to harry he felt his heart constrict as he took in the lost and hurt look in ginny eyes i ve been a horrible friend she said quietly yes you have harry agreed but here your chance to make it up to me okay ginny replied but please no big brother stuff i not your brother harry said more vehemently than was necessary ginny raised her eyebrow and shrugged harry took a deep breath he knew why he didntwant ginny thinking of him as a brother but that didntgive him permission to act like a prat it was his own damn fault for being blind to her beauty when she was available stupid prat that he was fancy a walk harry asked not wanting ron or his other teammates to interrupt his chat with ginny sure ginny said slinging her broom over her shoulder lead the way harry nodded turning to walk towards the lake they walked in silence for awhile the sun was sinking low towards the horizon creating a glowing haze over the grounds harry glanced at ginny her hair was tied back in a ponytail several wisps of hair had escaped dancing lightly around her face her hair seemed to glow with the setting sun making her the brightest thing in sight her cheeks still held a rosy glow from the exertion of a hard practice is there something on my face ginny asked self consciously swiping her fingers across her cheeks harry blushed having been caught gawking at her er no no i dontthink so harry inwardly cringed at his ability to make a git of himself he took a deep breath wanting to detour the conversation before ginny asked why he had been staring at her so harry began awkwardly norbert ginny turned abruptly dropping her broom to the ground and clutching harry arms i so sorry harry i know i haventbeen a good friend and i know leaving a stuffed dragon on your bed doesntmake up for me being totally absent in your life the last few days harry smiled i liked the stuffed dragon bit he felt a blush creep across his cheeks i know it not macho like you said but i really did appreciate the gesture it should have been me instead ginny said shaking her head harry mind ran wild it should have been you in my bed ginny eyes opened wide and her jaw dropped harry she shrieked harry grinned his face deep red well that is what you said he reasoned ginny punched harry in the shoulder laughing you prat you know that not what i meant harry shrugged my loss then harry began to wonder what strange entity had entered his body was he actually flirting with ginny weasley was he mental did he have a death wish ginny looked at harry as though he were a puzzle to figure out she eventually smiled and said i like this side of you harry it doesntcome out nearly enough what side is that harry asked eager to act in whatever way she found pleasing ginny shrugged i dontknow light hearted teasing almost playful her cheeks burned red as she ducked her head and dug her toe into the ground well it a heck of a lot easier to be those things when you re around harry said truthfully he watched as ginny smiled at the ground he decided now may be the time to give her a nudge so are you going to tell me why i haventseen you in days ginny smile turned into a frown she plopped down to the ground sitting cross legged harry sat across from her waiting silently harry ginny began hesitantly yeah ginny eyes darted up to harry before focusing on the grass again she took a deep breath and asked how did you know to break up with parvati harry eyes widened he hadntexpected her to ask him about relationship advice bloody hell um i dontknow it was just well it got to be too much work he answered lamely ginny nodded mum always says a good relationship requires a lot of work harry frowned are you saying i gave up too easily ginny raised her head in shock no it not that at all i already told you i thought you and parvati were a horrible match right harry said confused ginny sighed turning her frustration on the blades of grass in front of her plucking at them with aggravation i trying to make my relationship with dean work i think maybe i gave up too quickly with michael not that i regret it or anything but i mean we argued once and broke up we didnteven try to work on it harry felt his insides twist uncomfortably discussing ginny boyfriends with her was not something that he enjoyed doing but at least she was talking to him again he had to fight the very strong urge to tell ginny to drop the great git then he could date her and they could try some of the things that flashed through his mind at the thought of ginny on his bed instead of norbert harry shook his head of the images flooding his mind now not the time potter clearing his throat harry asked so your argument with dean today was not the first ginny snorted definitely not she pulled her knees up in front of her resting her chin on top of them the last week has been rough because of hogsmeade harry asked remembering how hurt ginny had been that the great git hadntinvited her to go with him that part of it we argue over other stuff too it seems all we do lately is argue i dontwant to just give up but i dontwant to keep going on like this either harry watched ginny he wanted to break dean legs and throw him in the lake for the giant squid dinner ginny looked at harry stirring the fluttering in his heart when do i say enough is enough harry she whispered harry swallowed this was not something he could discuss with her he wanted to tell her to toss him and throw a few bat bogey hexes for good measure but if she ever found out how he felt about her would she think he had done it for selfish reasons was it for selfish reasons his feelings were so jumbled he didntknow which way was up this was definitely a decision ginny had to make on her own i cantanswer that for you gin i rubbish at relationships all i ll say is that you deserve to be happy you need to figure out what will make that happen ginny stared morosely across the lake what if the thing that would make me the happiest is out of reach harry felt his insides twist at the sadness in her voice he reached for her hand and squeezed it nothing is out of reach gin she turned her eyes to him and smiled maybe not for you he chuckled i wish that were true i sorry i let my relationship troubles with dean get in the way of our friendship harry it okay no it not i going to be the best friend a bloke could have from now on to make it up to you ginny stated firmly harry felt his heart sink a little brilliant he said less than enthusiastically ginny took both of his hands in hers and straightened her posture first off tell me about your conversation with dumbledore harry studied ginny determination glowed from her eyes and he knew she wouldntbe satisfied until he went over everything that had happened over the last few days he smiled at her and shook his head loving her tenacity and the way her eyes sparkled at him he delved into explaining dumbledore plot to get harry to stop blaming himself he talked about his apology to ron they talked at length about the daily prophet article and everyone reactions to it harry loved talking to ginny about anything and everything he loved the light laugh that fell from her lips as much as the deep hearty chuckle that shook her whole body he loved the burning anger and fierce loyalty that radiated from her when she thought he had been treated unfairly he loved the doting care and sympathy she showed him when he explained with embarrassment what he had done to professor pandoran he simply loved spending time with her harry was listening intently to ginny tale of an incident in her potions lesson that morning when a streak across the sky caught his attention did you see that he asked jumping to his feet ginny scrambled to her feet beside him no what was it the streak had disappeared from harry vision he spun toward the gates to the school it was a silver streak of something it came from over there he said pointing at the gates ginny squinted there someone at the gate harry squinted as well he could see a figure that seemed to be kneeling next to a dark shape on the ground the figure rose and with a half turn toward harry and ginny disapparated harry ginny said was that a death eater harry answered in a whisper they broke into a run simultaneously pulling out their wands neither knew what the death eater had left behind but if it was a weapon of some kind they needed to alert their headmaster maybe you should go get dumbledore harry said maybe you should ginny replied running stride for stride with harry harry mentally shook his head of course it was foolish to think he d be able to talk ginny away from a potentially dangerous situation she was as stubborn as him if not more so they slowed as they neared the gate they eyed the shape nervously trying to determine from a distance what it was ginny gasped harry froze parvati shifted her hair falling away from her face parvati harry shouted running at the gate ginny was at his side they tugged at the gate fighting against its locks ginny fired unlocking spells and harry tried a variety of blasting curses finally the gate sprung open as dumbledore and mcgonagall appeared at their side is she okay ginny asked allowing dumbledore and mcgonagall to go to parvati side there was someone else harry said his voice choked relief washed over him to see parvati alive but he was soon nauseous when he saw the bruising on her cheek and mcgonagall pull her hand away from parvati head covered in blood a death eater harry continued his voice tight he rescued me parvati quiet voice explained he saved me did you see his face dumbledore asked quietly parvati shook her head and then winced no she said her teeth gritted but i know he bald and wears a hooped earring harry mouth opened in shock his eyes darted from dumbledore to mcgonagall who seemed to be having a silent conversation he then looked at ginny who mouthed shacklebolt harry nodded his heart racing had it been shacklebolt in the death eater robes was he alive and working for voldemort harry couldntimagine the lengths shacklebolt would have had to go through to convince voldemort to not only keep him alive but to allow him into his inner circle harry respect for the auror tripled we need to get her to the hospital wing mcgonagall said casting a worried glance at dumbledore dumbledore nodded can you stand miss patil parvati moved slightly and then shook her head tears pooling in her eyes we ll need a stretcher mcgonagall said a simple levitation may be too painful without any support dumbledore nodded and silently conjured a stretcher beside parvati dumbledore and mcgonagall rolled her slowly and gently onto her back and onto the stretcher she attempted to stifle her whimpers but it was obvious that she was in a great deal of pain miss patil mcgonagall said softly you need to stay awake i believe your ribs are broken but no matter the pain i need you to stay awake parvati nodded she had come this far she wouldntgive up now mcgonagall levitated parvati on the stretcher so that she floated several feet off the ground mcgonagall began maneuvering parvati across the grounds towards the castle harry and ginny stumbled behind their minds lost in their own thoughts mr potter miss weasley harry and ginny turned at the sound of dumbledore voice he had locked the gates and reset the wards guarding the school mr brooks has made sure that the corridors have been cleared we do not want a scene when miss patil is brought in i would ask you to keep this to yourselves tonight the patil family has the right to know about parvati before the whole of hogwarts harry and ginny nodded numbly furthermore you must keep the information about the death eater that brought miss patil to us a secret do not tell anyone it is vital to his survival that his whereabouts continue to be unknown harry and ginny nodded again dumbledore surveyed them thoughtfully i am sorry you had to see miss patil in such a state but rest assured madam pomfrey will heal her in no time thank you professor ginny mumbled dumbledore nodded and then set off to help professor mcgonagall harry and ginny walked silently to their discarded brooms by the lake by silent agreement they walked to the water edge and stared across the lake taking in the beauty and peacefulness in the wake of such shock do you think she ll be okay ginny asked quietly i hope so harry replied softly she was in a lot of pain did you see the blood harry nodded his throat constricting yeah he choked out they watched the giant squid rise to the surface of the lake stretching each of its arms in turn its movements were oddly graceful creating a soothing ripple across the water which lapped at the shore in front of them one final flourish and the mysterious creature sank back to the depths below i feel really stupid about my fight with dean ginny whispered harry turned to her questioningly why ginny sighed i upset over a silly boy while parvati been going through merlin knows what my problems are foolish and insignificant it does put a different perspective on things doesntit harry replied ginny had a faraway look as she gazed across the lake i need to talk to dean she said harry heart jumped oh i ll tell him what i need to make me happy and see if he can give it to me she replied it wasntquite what he was looking for but harry was comforted by the fact that his girl would at least be happy ready to go harry asked ginny turned and locked her gaze with harry s harry found it difficult to breathe as her eyes blazed into his he fought the urge to pull her to him in a fierce embrace as ready as i ll ever be she said bending down to pick up her broom and leading them on their path back to the castle a n omg this chapter has been a thorn in my side i struggled with so many aspects trying to get it just right how did i do chapter 3 a break in the weather harry did not know how long he sat there in mrs figg kitchen crying into his arms he had been vaguely aware of remus moving his chair closer to harry and placing his hand on harry back soothingly harry had finally let himself feel the pain that was so deep inside him he finally let himself mourn the death of his godfather he finally let go eventually harry ragged breathing slowed and the tears extinguished themselves remus was still beside harry comforting him with his mere presence harry lifted his head wiped his tear stained face on his sleeves and took a deep breath sorry harry said gruffly pulling off his glasses to wipe them clean he put them back on and looked at remus remus eyes were as red and puffy as harry s i thought you did rather well remus said giving harry a small smile it took me three tries to get through my letter harry smiled for the first time in a long time he did not feel alone harry glanced around the kitchen where professor dumbledore he took kreacher into the other room i ll go remus began rising from his chair but just as he straightened up dumbledore returned to the kitchen excellent timing as always professor remus remarked sinking back into his chair dumbledore smiled and returned to his seat to harry right dimbledore penetrating blue eyes surveyed harry it okay professor i fine harry said returning dumbledore gaze dumbledore seemed to consider harry words for a moment then replied yes harry i do believe you are fine his eyes crinkled as he gave harry a warm smile unfortunately we do have some paperwork to finish up dumbledore returned to the stack of papers in front of him harry is it safe for me to assume that sirius stated his wishes regarding your guardianship in his letter harry shifted in his seat aware of remus sitting next to him y yes sir good then let make this official dumbledore looked through the papers in front of him yes here it is he said pulling a paper out from the bottom of the stack dumbledore paused looking first at harry then to remus as stated here sirius has named remus as your godfather harry dumbledore paused again harry sat quietly staring at dumbledore dumbledore peered over his glasses at remus and asked remus do you fully accept this responsibility harry held his breath and darted his eyes to remus remus kind eyes looked at harry searchingly harry mind began to race what if he says no what if he doesntwant me harry stomach began to tighten nothing would make me more proud than to be harry godfather remus said putting his hand on harry shoulder that is if harry will have me the air harry had been holding in rushed out of him he grinned at remus absolutely they smiled at each other and then turned to the paperwork dumbledore set in front of them after everything was signed dumbledore waved his wand and the papers disappeared dumbledore sighed leaning back in his chair it feels good to have that business taken care of he smiled at remus and harry i for one think sirius has made an excellent decision harry smiled as he stared at the table top reflecting on everything that had happened since he came to mrs figg house harry experienced one surprise after another some good some not harry had been feeling so horrible for so long that he felt quite odd sitting there feeling content there was still an empty feeling inside him but it no longer consumed him he knew that he would always feel the loss of sirius but he was not alone in this sirius had made sure of that sirius last request had ensured that harry would be surrounded by people who had known and loved his parents who would be there for him in the difficult times ahead at this thought harry turned to dumbledore and asked is there any news has anything happened since harry broke off as memories flooded his mind he was thinking of that fateful day at the ministry of magic not only did harry lose sirius in the department of mysteries that day but he and his friends had faced and battled an army of death eaters ending with harry facing lord voldemort once again no harry dumbledore said gravely it seems that voldemort unexpected appearance at the ministry of magic has caused him to go even further into hiding he was quite happy when everyone was denying his return but having been witnessed by so many people in the ministry he is likely reformulating his plans what will his plans be now that the prophecy is destroyed harry asked his mouth going dry as he thought of the prophecy i have some ideas but i cantbe sure dumbledore replied this is the other reason for my being here today harry harry swallowed why that sir dumbledore looked at harry as his forehead wrinkled with concern i afraid voldemort may try to break into your mind again harry nodded he was not surprised by this information whatever plans voldemort had harry knew he would be part of them i wanted to ask you harry dumbledore said leaning forward in his chair have you had any indication that voldemort is trying to reach you any dreams any pain in your scar harry shook his head no nothing more than the usual prickling of my scar dumbledore nodded leaning back in his chair and lacing his fingers together in front of him if you feel up to it harry i d like you to study occlumency again harry thoughts took him back to the occlumency sessions in the dungeon with professor snape harry potions teacher harry father and snape had been in school together at hogwart s and had despised each other snape had redirected his hate for james onto harry and harry returned the feelings the sessions with snape had not been a good experience and it had ended with an incident that left snape hating harry if possible even more harry shifted in his chair i dontthink professor snape will agree to it no harry dumbledore smiled grimly i have learned my lesson i would be teaching you occlumency harry stared at dumbledore his mouth open slightly harry knew dumbledore to be extremely busy especially with all the things going on with the order if dumbledore was setting time aside to work with harry he must be worried about something happening harry thought again of his sessions with snape harry had always felt horrible after his head had throbbed with excruciating pain as snape attacked his mind over and over again the thought of going through that again was not appealing to harry harry took a deep breath when do we start dumbledore bright blue eyes twinkled at harry you never cease to amaze me harry dumbledore said inclining his head to the side you have far more strength than you give yourself credit for i couldntagree more remus said startling harry for he had sat silent for so long harry squirmed in his chair uncomfortable with being complimented for something that he felt he did not have well harry when do you think you will be ready to leave dumbledore asked err leave professor harry asked his eyebrows furrowed together in confusion yes harry leave dumbledore said a hint of a smile playing on his lips i am assuming you will want to leave privet drive to go live with your godfather harry mouth fell open but i thought i thought i had to stay for my mom protection you said yes harry you re right dumbledore said cutting harry off as i explained to you recently it is necessary for you to return to live with your aunt petunia every year to maintain the old magic that protects you through your mother blood i must admit i would prefer you to stay here i still believe this to be the safest place for you however your godfather dumbledore continued nodding towards remus assures me that you will be quite safe living with him harry swallowed his mind reeling the thought of returning to grimmauld place without sirius sent a chill down harry spine it will definitely be weird harry thought to himself but it is remus and my house now i cantstay away forever and the dursleys harry decision was made i ll be ready to leave as soon as you ll let me harry said determinedly remus smiled how about tomorrow is that too soon an hour from now wouldntbe too soon harry said fervently returning remus smile remus laughed well let stick with tomorrow it will give you a chance to let your aunt and uncle know of the arrangements they wontcare harry said quietly remus looked at harry with a hint of sadness you re probably right harry but you should explain the circumstances to them harry nodded still trying to wrap his mind around the thought that he d be leaving the dursleys tomorrow shall we say noon then harry remus asked standing and clapping harry on the shoulder sounds great harry replied standing up as well we ll be taking the knight bus so it may be best to have a small breakfast tomorrow remus said his eyes twinkling good idea harry said with a laugh he had been on the knight bus twice before and knew the stops and starts and twists and turns of the bus only too well well then harry i will give you a day to get settled in your new home dumbledore said joining remus and harry by the kitchen door i will come by on monday to begin your occlumency lessons all right professor harry replied dumbledore led the way out of the kitchen into the sitting room mrs figg was sitting in her rocking chair knitting one of her colourful cat sized blankets that she called gannies oh she said jumping up have you finished yes arabella thank you again for your kindness dumbledore said walking over to her and shaking her hand warmly my pleasure she said smiling up at dumbledore we must be off dumbledore said bowing to her slightly and then turning to face harry and remus mrs figg rushed over to harry here you are dear she said handing harry his coat i dried it for you it should be nice and dry for your walk home although i not sure you ll need it anymore she said gesturing to the window harry looked outside the rain had indeed stopped and the sun seemed to be finding its way through the clouds the shrubs in front of mrs figg house sparkled brightly as the sunlight bounced off the raindrops that still clung to the leaves when will you be stopping by again harry dear mrs figg asked looking expectantly at harry err harry shifted uncomfortably on his feet shooting a glance to dumbledore and then to remus harry will be leaving tomorrow to live with remus arabella dumbledore said putting a hand on her shoulder her eyes opened wide and her mouth opened and closed several times as she tried to speak her eyes filled up with tears oh harry she sobbed grabbing him tightly into a hug harry his arms pinned to his sides once again stood awkwardly in her embrace she released him sniffing softly i guess i always knew this day would come she said nodding her head she turned to remus shaking her finger at him you take good care of him remus smiled solemnly i promise i will mrs figg then threw herself at remus and hugged him remus patted her on the back consolingly smiling at harry over her head she pulled back holding him by the arms and stared into remus eyes i know you will dumbledore cleared his throat as mrs figg released remus harry remus and i will be apparating from here i imagine you have some packing to do so we ll leave you to it harry nodded looking from dumbledore to remus still not quite comprehending everything that had happened since he arrived there his gaze moved to mrs figg who was standing with her arms wrapped around herself her bottom lip quivering slightly harry stepped over to mrs figg and gave her a hug bye mrs figg thank you for everything she hiccoughed as he stepped back stay out of trouble mrs figg said harry grinned i ll try he nodded to remus and dumbledore bye then see you tomorrow harry remus replied grinning at harry good bye harry dumbledore said harry turned and walked out the door of mrs figg house into the brilliant sunshine his feet splashed through the puddles still lying on the sidewalk but he did not notice his feet carried him home as a million thoughts raced through his mind before he knew it harry was in his bedroom tossing his scattered belongings into his trunk he had walked straight through the house without even noticing if the dursleys were home he could think of nothing else other than making sure he had everything ready to go for tomorrow as harry was clearing some rolls of parchment off his desk his thoughts fell to his best friends they likely had no idea that he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow harry knew that they would want to know he sat down with a quill in his hand poised to write he worked the words over in his head carefully not wanting to say anything too specific in case the letters were intercepted dear ron i cantsay much now but as of tomorrow i ll be living at snuffles old place no need to worry and i ll explain it all soon harry harry frowned down at his letter not quite satisfied with it but knowing that he couldntinclude any more details harry ron and hermione had referred to sirius as snuffles for some time now to make sure no would know who they were talking about harry scanned the letter once more sighed and then wrote the same letter to hermione he called hedwig down from her cage where she had been sleeping with her head nestled under her wing she eyed him warily and then swooped down to his desk take these to ron and hermione but dontcome back here go to grimmauld place instead i ll be there tomorrow okay harry said tying the letters to hedwig outstretched leg she nipped his finger lightly to show she understood then soared out the open window harry returned to packing his trunk he was amazed at how much he had scattered his things in the few days he had been back suddenly there was a sharp knock on his door harry come down for supper aunt petunia said through the door harry was shocked that the afternoon was gone already he must have been longer at mrs figg than he thought he tossed the t shirts he was holding into his trunk and then went downstairs to the kitchen dudley and uncle vernon were already seated at the table their plates mounded with food harry sat down in his seat where his plate held one sausage a quarter of a potato and a few carrots he smiled my last meal here for the summer what are you smiling at boy uncle vernon spat harry smiled even wider oh nothing uncle vernon i was just thinking how great this supper looks thank you aunt petunia harry looked over to his aunt petunia his green eyes rounded innocently aunt petunia stopped mid pour over dudley glass of milk narrowing her eyes at harry uncle vernon and dudley stared at harry stupidly we dontneed any comments from you uncle vernon growled harry shrugged his shoulders and began to eat aunt petunia was not satisfied she took her seat and looked down her nose at harry how was your visit with mrs figg she asked smugly harry tilted his head to one side he had been wondering how he was going to approach the subject of him leaving and figured he might as well get it over with it was alright i didntsee much of mrs figg though harry replied forking a piece of sausage into his mouth aunt petunia took to the bait oh no why not she asked suspiciously narrowing her eyes further i spent most of the time talking with professor dumbledore and my godfather all three dursleys stared at harry silently then uncle vernon snorted liar he spat out but then laughed darkly your godfather is dead harry stopped chewing and swallowed hard staring at his uncle harry did not know how they knew that sirius had died he had not told them he could also not believe that his uncle had just laughed at the fact that harry godfather was dead he worse than kreacher harry thought to himself harry recollected his thoughts and replied i not lying i ve been named a new godfather harry resumed eating aunt petunia sniffed i sure he no better than the other if he one of your lot harry continued to chew his carrots ignoring aunt petunia comments aunt petunia shifted in her chair obviously disgruntled that her comment hadntgot a rise out of harry well what did they want snapped aunt petunia harry placed the last piece of sausage in his mouth and chewed slowly he swallowed okay this is it he told himself my godfather has asked me to go live with him and i ve accepted the dursleys stared at harry not knowing whether to believe him or not harry watched as his uncle and aunt faces flushed you well i he sputtered aunt petunia she pressed her lips into a thin line then said dontyou think we should have a say in this harry shook his head it all been done professor dumbledore knows and i leaving harry said matter of factly he rose from the table taking his dishes to the sink well i should think we have some say aunt petunia continued shrilly harry walked towards the kitchen door and paused wondering why she was feigning concern aunt petunia continued how do we know this new godfather of yours is trustworthy is he a murderer like the last one harry stared at his aunt considering her comment slowly a smile spread across his face no aunt petunia he not a murderer he a werewolf and he ll be by tomorrow at noon to get me harry turned and left the kitchen laughing etching the looks of absolute horror on the dursleys faces into his mind forever chapter 6 occlumency obstacles and owls harry saw dudley nine year old face laughing at him menacingly uncle vernon fist raised as a threat voldemort snake like eyes staring out of the back of his professor head a group of dementors advancing on the quidditch pitch sirius look of shock and fear as his body arched and fell gracefully backwards ouch harry gasped as his hands and knees hit the floor once again it was wednesday and harry third straight afternoon of occlumency with dumbledore harry had soon realized that his hope that the lessons with dumbledore would be easier than with snape was na ve it was true that harry did not have to deal with snape snide remarks but dumbledore was vigilant in his attacks on harry mind he had been completely unprepared for the power and strength with which dumbledore came after him harry body was bruised and his head had been pounding since his first session on monday that ll do harry dumbledore said helping harry to his feet let take a break harry collapsed into the chair in the drawing room where they had been working and rested his face in his hands he felt as though a meat cleaver had smashed into his forehead i never going to be able to do this harry mumbled under his breath dumbledore sat in an armchair opposite harry you re making great progress harry harry lifted his head and looked at dumbledore i dontknow what you mean sir i still cantblock you from getting into my mind dumbledore smiled slightly just because i can still force myself in doesntmean that you haventimproved it sure doesntfeel like i ve improved harry muttered rubbing his forehead let me try to explain it from my point of view dumbledore said peering at harry over his half moon spectacles when we began just two days ago harry i had to do little more than look at you to enter your mind today i had to use much more energy i had to focus and fight my way in it is no longer an easy task i am convinced that if we continue with these lessons you will be able to block my attempts completely harry winced as another stab of pain shot through his head will it ever stop hurting dumbledore observed harry solemnly i wish i could answer that harry normally the pain does subside the act of blocking the mind becomes natural one just does it without thinking however harry dumbledore said with concern etched on his face you do not fall into any normal category your scar stumps us and i have no idea if you will ever be able to rid yourself of the pain completely harry put his head back in his hands and said quietly i d give anything to be normal they sat in silence for several minutes harry sat pressing a cold cloth to his forehead that dumbledore had cast a cooling spell on so it would stay cold it was the only thing that helped the pain in harry head there something i ve been wanting to talk to you about harry dumbledore announced breaking the silence harry looked at his professor dumbledore was sitting with his elbows on the arms of his chair peering at harry over his steepled fingers his bright blue eyes reflected concern it about the prophecy dumbledore continued watching harry closely harry mouth went dry he had not talked to anyone about the prophecy but he spent hours thinking about it every day yes sir harry asked have you told anyone dumbledore asked harry shook his head i glad harry dumbledore replied the less people that know the contents of the prophecy the better harry nodded he had no desire to tell anyone about it anyway however dumbledore continued i do believe there is someone you should tell harry looked at dumbledore questioningly as far as i know harry you and i are the only living people that know the entire contents of the prophecy your parents were the only other people to know professor trelawney has no memory of delivering the prophecy harry was surprised you mean the members of the order dontknow no harry all they knew was that there was a prophecy made about you and voldemort they knew it would be detrimental for voldemort to get his hands on the prophecy but they never knew why the fact that voldemort wanted it so badly illustrated the importance of it and they risked their lives to guard it from him harry replied quietly why didntyou tell them dumbledore shook his head it is not my place to tell them harry harry shifted in his chair you said that i should tell someone dumbledore studied harry for several seconds his piercing blue eyes boring through harry it is completely up to you who you tell i have no doubt that a time will come when you tell your friends you have excellent friends harry i know they will be a great support for you i also know that you are not yet ready to tell them and they may not yet be ready to hear it harry shook his head at the thought of telling his friends but i think there is someone who deserves to know dumbledore replied harry stared at dumbledore waiting remus he said simply harry leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling harry thought of everything remus had already been through and thought he could not add another thing to worry about why harry whispered shifting forward and staring at the floor because he loves you harry you are his godson i was a fool to keep it from you harry and i should never have kept it from sirius either the people that love you deserve to know they need to know we do not only share our successes with our loved ones but also our burdens it is hard for you to accept love harry it saddens me that you have spent much of your life without feeling loved you need to realize harry there are many people who love you you must let them in you must share your burdens with them you must let them help you harry blinked hard his throat had tightened considerably as he listened to dumbledore harry struggled with dumbledore words as they washed over him do you think you can tell him harry dumbledore asked quietly harry head throbbed painfully and his throat was so tight it was burning he looked up at dumbledore knowing he could not do it alone could you help me dumbledore smiled softly of course i can harry put his head in his hands okay i ll tell him shall i go get him dumbledore asked harry nodded it would be better to get it over with dumbledore left the room leaving harry alone harry grabbed the cold cloth and pressed it against his forehead letting the coolness soothe and calm him his throat began to loosen although his stomach was still clenched dumbledore returned quickly with a concerned looking remus are you alright harry remus asked rushing over to harry and putting a hand on his shoulder dumbledore said you needed to talk to me harry looked into his godfather face harry saw the love and concern dumbledore had talked about in remus eyes his stomach clenched tighter i fine harry said i just have something to tell you perhaps you should sit down remus dumbledore said conjuring a chair beside harry remus face paled as he sat in the chair he leaned his elbows on his knees and peered at harry what is it he asked softly harry cleared his throat it about the prophecy remus looked at harry confused what prophecy harry looked down at his hands the one about voldemort and me that the order was trying to protect the one that was smashed in the room where where sirius died remus nodded what about it harry looked at dumbledore he wasntsure how to continue as you know remus dumbledore explained the prophecies held in the department of mysteries are only a record however the person who hears the prophecy has the means to recall the prophecy despite the orb being destroyed yes i understand that remus replied harry looked at remus professor dumbledore was the person the prophecy was made to harry said quietly remus eyes widened and his jaw dropped slightly he closed his mouth swallowing hard does that mean you know what it says remus asked harry nodded his forehead wrinkling as he looked at remus worriedly remus looked to dumbledore and then back to harry is that what you want to tell me remus asked softly again harry nodded as his throat tightened he looked at dumbledore silently asking for help all right harry dumbledore asked and harry nodded dumbledore sat forward in his chair a pained look crossing his face he recited the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies they sat quietly dumbledore words seeming to echo through the room remus had his face in his hands and harry could hear the unevenness of his breath dumbledore sat staring at the floor a frown deepening the lines on his face remus straightened in his chair looking visibly shaken he raised his glance to meet harry eyes they looked at each other both at a loss for words harry stood in the shower the hot water pounding over his head he had been standing there motionless for several minutes wishing the water could wash away the pain his head and body ached from his lessons with dumbledore and his heart ached from watching remus learn of the prophecy harry turned the water off and toweled himself dry he stared at himself in the mirror he looked pale and sickly his bright green eyes had a ghost like quality to them his scar shone brightly as though it was till hot from being burned into his skin harry shook his head at his reflection he ran a comb through his dark hair and uselessly tried to push his fringe down with his palm he tied his towel around his waist and headed for his bedroom he pushed open the door and stopped dead in his tracks standing in his bedroom pinning some sort of poster on the wall was ron and ginny unfortunately for harry the sound of the door was enough to get ginny attention with one hand still holding the poster ginny turned to the door hi har oh she gasped as she saw harry her hands flying to her mouth ginny what the ron began as he struggled to catch her end of the poster he turned to see what she was staring at ron laughed nice look harry harry face was burning he could care less if ron saw him in nothing but a towel but ginny was another matter turn around harry sputtered ginny spun herself around to face the wall her hands still covering her face ron chuckled and returned to pinning the poster on the wall harry crossed the room to his wardrobe and pulled a pair of boxers on underneath his towel and then slipped quickly into a pair of jeans and a t shirt good thing you were wearing a towel ron said still laughing well i dontusually make a habit of walking around naked harry replied sitting on his bed to pull his socks on that a shame ron said we could all use a good laugh ron ducked as a pillow soared straight toward his head harry laughed and glanced at ginny who was still standing with her hands over her face it okay ginny i dressed ginny turned around to face him grinning dontworry harry i ve got six brothers i ve seen a lot of boys in towels as long as it only your brothers that you re seeing ron said narrowing his eyes in warning ginny rolled her eyes no ron i ve actually been sneaking into the boys showers at hogwarts since first year didntyou know she said sarcastically harry sensed one of ron overprotective brother speeches he stood up and changed the subject what with the poster harry asked walking over to have a closer look ginny shot harry a grateful look ron said it one of my posters from home i thought with the whole redecorating thing i would donate this to try and brighten up this room upon closer inspection harry noticed that it was a poster of ron favourite quidditch team the chudley cannons thanks ron harry said but do you think we could get a poster of a good team it was harry turn to duck his head from a flying pillow good thing you re a keeper and not a chaser ron harry said grinning your aim is awful is that right ron said grabbing another pillow from the bed at least i wasntreplaced by a girl harry laughed picking up a pillow i wasntreplaced by a girl you moron i was kicked off the team and what wrong with a girl playing ron ginny asked her eyes sparkling and her face flushed she lunged for a pillow and hit ron in the stomach and so it started the three screamed and laughed as they swung pillows at each other taking their battle to all corners of the room harry had at first been hesitant to go after ginny and focused instead on ron but after ginny landed three solid hits on him he gave her no mercy harry took advantage of the fact that ron last pillow to ginny had knocked her to the floor he pinned her down holding one of her hands above her head as he tried to grab the pillow from her other hand what going on here harry eyes shot to the doorway as ron pillow hit him squarely in the ribs standing with her hands on her hips and an unreadable expression on her face was mrs weasley harry looked back at ginny realizing he was straddling her pushed himself up quickly and hoped his face wasntas red as it felt he reached out his hand and helped ginny to her feet a smile seemed to tug at the corners of mrs weasley mouth i ve never seen this approach to redecorating before harry ron and ginny looked at the room around them there were feathers everywhere a few still floating through the air and at some point they had knocked over the nightstand and lamp the quilts had been torn off both beds likely as a result of a frantic search for more pillows all in all the room was a disaster i ve come to tell you that we ve just received word from hermione she hopes to be here by the end of next week mrs weasley said brilliant ron said happily yes hopefully some of her good sense will rub off on you lot mrs weasley said eyeing the room well clean up and come downstairs supper will be ready shortly mrs weasley then walked over to harry and have him a tight hug i so happy to see you harry thanks for coming mrs weasley harry said returning her hug it great to have all of you here mrs weasley released harry we ll do anything we can to help harry nodded his head and smiled i know the days went by quickly harry spent every morning cleaning or in some cases tearing apart different areas of the house so far they had torn off the carpet in the entryway and drawing room mrs weasley was quite happy to find a wooden floor underneath it was in quite good condition and with one of her polishing spells mrs weasley had it looking like new in no time ron and harry had spent an entire morning moving the stuffed house elf heads of kreacher ancestors from the hallway to the attic they would rather have binned them but kreacher went into such hysterics that they decided against it kreacher for the most part stayed out of everyone way harry still felt a surge of anger every time he saw the house elf but he managed to focus instead on the happiness of the people surrounding him harry was still spending a few hours every afternoon with dumbledore his occlumency lessons had not been any easier and he usually returned to his bedroom for a rest after each lesson with the cold cloth pressed to his forehead this is how hermione had found him the day she arrived harry was lying flat on his back the cloth resting on his forehead and his eyes closed he felt a weight on his bed as he heard a quiet voice say hi harry he pulled the cloth off his face and saw a blurry hermione sitting next to him he sat up grabbed his glasses from his nightstand and smiled hi you look awful hermione said staring into his face gee thanks harry replied sarcastically pulling his knees up to his chest how are you doing she asked watching him closely he smiled at her concerned face i fine she looked at him skeptically so what it like being back here harry shook his head she was definitely not going to let him off easy he took a deep breath it was really hard at first he said looking at his feet i kept walking into rooms expecting to see sirius there but i used to it now i just really miss him oh harry hermione cried throwing her arms around his neck i so glad you ll talk to me about it she released him and he grinned at her like you would let me get away without talking about it she smiled you usually disappear before i get a chance to corner you that true harry replied you did a good job of catching me while my guard was down hermione grinned i know but honestly hermione i felling a lot better remus and i have talked about sirius quite a bit he been really great i so happy sirius named remus your godfather he such a kind person hermione replied harry nodded with everyone here i actually feel like i have a family hermione smiled her eyes bright with tears she nodded and hugged harry again you do have a family harry we re all your family harry hugged his best friend back it had felt good to talk to her hm mmm harry looked towards the door ron stood there looking at harry and hermione awkwardly come in ron harry said releasing hermione we were just talking ron shuffled in and sat on his bed looking from harry to hermione what were you talking about he asked quietly hermione just made me spill my guts about sirius harry said be glad you werenthere mate you know how mushy she gets he finished wrinkling his nose ron laughed as hermione punched harry in the arm well harry i glad you re talking about it hermione said shaking her head i dontknow what was worse having our heads bit off every time we tried to talk to you or you not talking to us at all thanks for reminding me what a prat i was harry said sarcastically any time harry hermione said smiling ginny came running into the room her face flushed these just came she exclaimed holding up several envelopes in her hand with a look of shock on her face what is it ginny hermione asked frowning ginny swallowed your owl results harry ron and hermione stared at the envelopes in ginny hand the owls were the exams all students wrote at the end of fifth year the results determine which classes can be taken during the last two years at hogwarts well let have them hermione said shrilly as she jumped up and grabbed the envelopes out of ginny hand she threw an envelope each to ron and harry and then sat down beside ron she glanced at ron and harry who sat staring at their envelopes then sighed and tore her envelope open harry and ron watched her to see her reaction after a moment she looked up at them go on open yours harry returned to staring at the envelope in his hand he had not thought of his owls since leaving hogwarts he had too many other thoughts occupying his mind but now that they were in his hand the importance of them overwhelmed him the papers inside the envelope would determine his future harry decided he might as well get it over with he opened the envelope and skimmed over the opening paragraphs then there they were the list of his classes with his exam results astronomya care of magical creatureso charmse defense against the dark artso divinationp herbologye history of magicp potionso transfiguratione harry stared at his potions grade he couldntbelieve it he squeezed his eyes shut shook his head and looked at the paper again it true harry told himself i managed an outstanding in potions what is it harry hermione asked you look like you re going to pass out harry shook his head in disbelief he looked over to ron who had just opened his envelope harry watched as ron scanned down his page ron eyes widened and his mouth dropped open he looked at harry potions harry asked ron nodded his head for heaven sake what are the two of you going on about hermione exclaimed i got an o in potions harry said barely above a whisper me too ron added his eyes still wide well of course you did hermione said rolling her eyes you know professor snape marks extremely difficult you were bound to do better on your owls ron looked at hermione in disbelief it would have been nice to know that a month ago i thought i d be lucky to pass oh honestly ronald hermione exclaimed shaking her head ron raised his eyebrows at harry who shrugged in response the realization that he received all of the required marks for auror training seeped through harry he smiled broadly by the looks on ron and hermione faces they got the marks they had hoped for as well ginny who had been standing and watching the reactions of the other three stomped her foot and said isntanyone going to tell me how they did harry smiled at her and held his paper out for her to take well done harry ginny said as she stared at his grades seven owls is really very good i got seven as well ron said happily of course hermione got all of hers hermione blushed well yes well done hermione harry said sincerely the four spent the rest of the afternoon talking about the owls harry set ginny into a fit of giggles when he told her about ron disastrous divination practical while hermione rolled her eyes ron reminded harry of how hermione was sure she was going to fail ancient runes because of one missed translation they laughed even harder when she admitted she got an o i really should send my parents a letter hermione stated ron can i borrow pigwidgeon sure go ahead ron replied thanks i ll just got to my room to write the letter hermione said want to come ginny sure ginny said as she followed hermione to the door she paused and turned around oh ron by the way fred and george are coming tonight to talk about that thing ron looked quickly at harry and then said to ginny right harry watched ginny leave and then asked what was that all about oh nothing ron said pretending to study his owl results again right harry said unbelievingly we re just trying to plan something for your birthday ron said nonchalantly really harry asked intrigued he had never had a birthday without the dursleys which basically meant he had never celebrated his birthday oh no you wontget any details out of me ron said slyly but if we get our way it going to be brilliant harry grinned at ron even if his birthday consisted of scrubbing out the attic with his friends it was going to be his best birthday ever chapter 8 alone harry woke up in his bed fully dressed in his clothes from the day before when he looked around the room he saw that ron had fallen asleep sitting upright on his bed leaning against the wall hermione had fallen asleep on ron shoulder and ginny was curled up like a cat at the foot of ron bed harry crawled out of bed and left the bedroom quietly in search of answers harry walked into the kitchen where mrs weasley and remus were sitting at the table hands clasped around their coffee cups mrs weasley eyes were glossy and red rimmed and worry lines creased her forehead remus face was drawn and he looked worse off than he did after a full moon what happened harry asked massaging his forehead as he sat down at the kitchen table remus studied harry sadly and asked what do you remember harry harry put his elbows on the table and placed his head in his hands he struggled to organize the pictures flashing through his head the delicious breakfast the pile of presents the roller coasters the ferris wheel the fireworks harry stomach clenched the dark mark harry said quietly a feeling of nausea rising from the pit of his stomach harry looked up at remus i dontremember anything after that remus nodded slowly we werentsure what you would remember we couldntcommunicate with you at all and then suddenly you fell to the ground holding your head we managed to get you to the portkey location and when we arrived back here you had passed out harry swallowed hard he did not remember anything that remus had described why donti remember any of that remus shrugged sadly i not sure harry if i were to guess i would say you were in shock that and the fact that your head probably felt like it was exploding prevented you from remembering anything harry closed his eyes flashes of people running and screaming rushed through his mind harry felt the terror that he was sure he had felt the night before spread through him is everyone okay harry asked raising his eyes to remus remus and mrs weasley glanced at each other mrs weasley bottom lip quivered as remus spoke hesitantly we donthave confirmation yet but we think there may have been some muggle casualties harry put his head in his hands his eyes burned as he thought of the hundreds of people that had been out for a day in the park innocent and happy people whose lives would be forever changed harry was horrified do you know who did it harry asked his voice straining remus shook his head no whoever it was came and went quickly arthur and moody could find no trace of anyone the ministry has taken over the investigation tonks walked into the kitchen carrying several newspapers oblivious to the strained atmosphere of the room front page on every one she said tossing the newspapers on the table the muggle newspapers and the daily prophet the story is everywhere harry moved his eyes to the newspaper on top of the pile the daily prophet had captured the glittering green message harry pulled the paper towards him the caption under the picture read the dark mark returns 3 muggles killed dozens injured harry felt sick tonks put her arm around harry and gave him a tight squeeze all right harry harry knew that the last thing he felt was all right the gravity of the situation weighed on him and the message in the sky haunted him if i hadntbeen there harry pushed tonks away and stood up i want to be alone tonks flinched slightly and took a step backward in surprise remus stood his face filled with concern harry harry eyes burned and a huge lump formed in his throat just leave me alone harry turned and left the kitchen leaving remus tonks and mrs weasley staring silently after him harry returned to his bedroom and found his friends still fast asleep he felt a pain in his chest when he realized any one of them could have been injured or killed the night before harry threw himself down on his bed and stared at the ceiling no matter where i go i put people in danger he thought again of the muggles that were killed and injured as a result of voldemort and his death eaters harry felt sick as he realized voldemort did not care who was killed harry pushed himself up on his bed and looked at his friends as he stared at them he made a vow to himself i will never put them in danger again harry knew what he had to do he got off his bed and began gathering his belongings he moved as quietly as he could loading his trunk if his plan was going to work he would have to distance himself from everyone he cared about harry harry threw the pile of clothes he was holding into his trunk and turned around ginny had pushed herself up on one arm and was rubbing her eyes with the other go back to sleep ginny harry said turning away from her ginny stood up walked over to harry and put her arms around him i so glad you re okay last night was so scary harry pushed ginny away forcefully dontworry about me ginny stared at him as her brown eyes filled with hurt and shock what wrong harry ginny asked oh i dontknow ginny harry said sarcastically i got three muggles killed as a birthday present from voldemort what could be wrong ginny took a moment to absorb harry harsh words her eyes shone brightly with tears three muggles were killed ginny whispered she put her hand on harry arm but harry it not your fault harry shrugged her hand off his arm if i hadntbeen there they wouldnthave been killed ginny shook her head tears threatening to spill down her cheeks no harry dontblame yourself donttell me what to do harry said quietly turning his back on her again ginny stood frozen shocked from the previous night events and now by harry coldness harry continued packing his things with a stab of guilt he picked up the pile of birthday presents from the foot of his bed he paused to look down at the picture ginny had given him his eyes began to burn and his throat tightened as he watched sirius smiling face i not going to give any one else to voldemort harry told himself resolutely no matter what i have to do he placed the presents in his trunk and closed the lid ron stirred slightly causing hermione to wake up she blinked her eyes several times trying to get the room into focus she looked at harry who was pulling his trunk towards the door and then noticed ginny tear stained face what going on hermione asked sitting up straight ginny stood staring at the floor as harry continued pulling his trunk to the door hermione stood up where are you going harry he dropped the end of the trunk to the floor and glared at hermione you ve got to get your nose into everything dontyou he spat hermione looked as though she had been kicked in the stomach she looked at harry confusedly her eyes shining brightly harry swallowed hard fighting to ignore his feelings of guilt as well as the pain in hermione eyes if you must know he muttered i moving into sirius old bedroom hermione stared at him why ron stirred again on his bed to get away from you harry snapped he then nodded his head toward ginny and ron i sick of being coddled by all of you i just want to be left alone harry said picking up the end of his trunk but harry hermione began taking a step toward harry shut up hermione cantyou ever just shut up harry yelled his eyes flashing hermione mouth fell open tears began streaming down her cheeks ron yawned widely who yelling he asked rubbing his eyes harry scowled pulled his trunk through the doorway and slammed the door ron stared open mouthed at the closed door as hermione and ginny stood still crying silently three days went by filled with strained silences and angry outbursts harry spent his days and nights in his new bedroom shutting out the world and attacking anyone who dared venture in ron hermione and ginny had tried to visit harry on several occasions at times they just attempted to make small talk at others they pleaded with him to talk to them on every occasion harry had yelled and insulted them remus had made several attempts to talk to harry as well he had tried to both comfort harry and admonish him for his behaviour but harry had pushed him even farther away feeling unworthy of the care that remus was showing him and guilty for the pain he was causing remus each time however harry reassured himself that he was doing the right thing when he wasnthurting the people he cared about harry tortured himself with his thoughts if i hadntgone no one would have been hurt it could have been remus or tonks or my friends it should have been me not innocent muggles no one is safe if they re with me i the one he wants i fell into the trap that killed sirius why was i so stupid to think i could have a normal day it better when i alone no one can get hurt if i alone harry was lying on his bed trying to convince himself that the words he had lashed at remus that morning were justified when there was a knock on the door go away harry growled to his annoyance he heard the doorknob turn he sat up on his bed and scowled at the door hermione pushed the door open followed by ginny and ron each carrying a tray of sandwiches and a pitcher of pumpkin juice and drinking glasses we thought we would have lunch with you harry hermione said forcing her voice to sound cheerful as she walked across the room to a table to the left of harry bed harry glared at them well you thought wrong harry snarled crossing his arms across his chest hermione eyes flickered slightly but then she continued pretending she hadntheard him come on harry you must be hungry harry eyes flashed dangerously get out he said quietly hermione stood with her hands on her hips and stared at harry then she turned took the tray from ginny hands and placed the sandwiches on the table ron can you please put the juice on the table here hermione continued ron hesitated looking from harry to hermione harry stood up glaring furiously at hermione i asked you to leave ron looked from harry to hermione again and then set the tray on the table he took a few steps toward harry and crossed his arms we re not leaving harry began shaking as the anger welled up inside him i dontwant you here he yelled get out and leave me alone ron hermione and ginny stood still standing their ground hermione took a step towards harry and then stopped harry we re your friends we care about you we cantstand to see you hurting like this we want to help you hermione pleaded her eyes shining brightly i dontneed any help harry snarled when will you get it through your thick heads that i dontwant you here i dontneed you harry stood glaring at his friends clenching his fists in anger suddenly ginny marched over and slapped harry hard across the face harry stared at her in shock and raised his hand to his stinging cheek stop being so selfish ginny yelled her face bright red and her eyes flashing harry stared at her his mouth gaping selfish have you ever stopped to consider what we need harry ginny retorted you may not need us but we need you she continued quietly harry scoffed you dontneed me you re better

his anger to rise he fought hard to keep his voice steady i not being arrogant ginny voldemort wants me dead donttalk about things you dontunderstand ginny was taken aback she swallowed hard fighting back tears well let me tell you what i do understand harry she said quietly i know that you are in danger i know that we put ourselves in danger by being your friend and i know you only want to

was breaking and his throat tightened as he looked at ron and hermione their faces filled with the pain he knew he had caused them he stared at the floor and cleared his throat i cantlet you risk your lives for me again you donthave a choice ginny said strongly harry looked into ginny eyes and saw her determination hermione walked over and slipped her hand into harry s like ginny said you re stuck with us harry harry looked at ron hoping to reason with him however ron cleared his throat and said determinedly we ve been through too much together mate we re not going to let you push us away we will always be by your side through everything harry felt himself losing control of the situation he sensed he was beginning to lose the battle he shook his head no i cantask you to do that he said staring at the floor ginny placed her hand on harry arm you re not asking us to do anything we re telling you how it is harry pulled himself free from both girls and sat on the edge of his bed he rested his head in his hands as he leaned his elbows on his knees why harry asked his voice cracking slightly why would you still want to be my friend hermione sat on the bed beside him resting her hand on harry back as she spoke you re a good person harry you dontgive yourself enough credit we re proud to be your friends nothing will ever change that harry shook his head in his hands but i was so awful harry raised his eyes to look at hermione how could you ever forgive me for the things i said to you hermione frowned at harry i wontlie to you harry you really hurt me but i know you did it because you wanted to protect me you thought if you hurt me badly enough i would leave you alone and hate you then in your mind i would be safe she paused and shook her head terrible reasoning if you ask me harry took hermione hand and squeezed it i am really sorry hermione you should hate me harry said quietly then he smiled slightly but i really glad you don t hermione burst into tears and threw her arms around harry harry i could never hate you harry hugged his friend thankful despite himself to have her back as hermione released him harry turned to ron and ginny i owe both of you an apology as well harry said standing up i sorry for being such an idiot ron shrugged well at least you ll admit it harry grinned ginny walked over and gave harry a quick hug she moved her hands to either side of his head and tilted his head down so that they were nearly nose to nose ginny stared into harry eyes i swear harry if you do this again i ll hex you so bad that st mungo will never get you right again harry stared into her eyes and grinned i have no doubt that you could and would ginny smiled and dropped her hands down to her side sorry i slapped you too bad i didnthave my wand on me this time harry laughed i glad you didn t you can save your bat bogey hex for malfoy that was really brilliant but can we eat now i starving ron whined harry laughed as hermione and ginny rolled their eyes and walked over to the table he sat down with his friends grabbed a sandwich and wondered how he ever thought life would be better without them
