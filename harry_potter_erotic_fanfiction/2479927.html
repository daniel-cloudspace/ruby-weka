stone harry waited downstairs for uncle vernon to come down he had been up since five because he was so excited he was leaving the dursleys and going to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry he smield at the thought of finally being free of the dursleys pacing back and forth harry wondered what his life would be like away from the dursleys the brief glimpse of the magical world hagrid had shown him was beyond amazing and he could not wait to see more he stopped pacing and sat on his trunk it was now 6 30 time was going far too slowly there was a small pop and an envelope was sitting on his trunk it read simply harry harry reached out one tentative hand and took the envelope the handwriting looked familiar but he could not place it he moved to open the letter and stopped there was a strange weight to the air and the envelope itself felt somehow heavier than it looked whatever was in the envelope harry was sure it would change his life as sure as his hogwarts letter had he opened it he was very surprised to see there were only three lines and that included the openning and the closing get to know ginny weasley fate owed me one harry j potter harry blinked he knew this had to be strange even for wizards but now he knew why he recognized the handwriting it was his i wonder who ginny is and why does fate owe me one he folded the letter and stuffed it in his pocket uncle vernon had left him at kings cross he had no idea how to find platform 9 3 4 panic started to rise and that was when he heard the voice packed with muggles of course followed by a girl voice nine and three quarters mom canti go harry moved toward the voices it was a family of redheads he could not help but feel relieved he had found wizards and witches perhaps now he would not have to start tapping the ticket counter with his wand however when he heard what could only be the mother respond his eyes widened and he felt his heart skip you re not old enough ginny now be quiet it cantbe a coincidence looking intently at the family of redheads he immediatly found the one called ginny she was obviously the youngest and she had long red hair and a smattering of freckles across her face harry worked his way closer to the family excuse me instead of speaking to the mother as would have been his first inclination he spoke to the one known as ginny ginny right for some reason the name on his tongue felt familiar and was accompanied by a strange feeling he did not recognize there was a feeling similar to the one he had felt when he had found the letter time itself seemed to be holding its breath as she nodded her bright brown eyes going wide as she looked at him how do i get on the platform she was blushing but smiled brightly at him all you ve got to do is walk straight at the wall there she said pointing come on i ll show you she grabbed his hand as if to pull him toward the barrier and something happened that had not occurred for more than two hundred years a pulse of magic emanated from the pair that could be felt weakly but felt all the way to hogwarts where albus dumbledore looked up from his desk and furrowed his eyebrows deep within the ministry of magic within a rarely used section of the hall of records a quill scratched out a sentence and date harry was not sure what to make of what he was feeling but it was amazing his entire body tingled there was no doubt in his mind that this small redhead was ginny weasley and he wanted to get to know her hi i harry ginny squeezed his hand and pulled him toward the barrier they went through together and harry stopped and gasped wow the train was magnificient yeah i cantwait until i can go i dontget to until next year she said dejectedly harry heart went out to her it was as if he could feel her pain he also felt a jolt of dissappointment that he would not be able to get to know her better until next year he wanted to make her feel better dontworry i sure a year will go by before you know it even to him the words sounded hollow but she smiled back at him he knew he should be getting on the train but he did not want to let go of her hand she was the first person who had ever taken it willingly and who did not mind i guess i guess i should get on the train she nodded sadly see you later then yeah harry slowly released his grasp on her hand and turned he began trying to get his trunk up into the carriage and ginny walked back to her watching mother luckily the twins he had seen earlier came over to help him they recognized his scar and harry would have found the reaction comical if he had not been so embarrassed he found an empty compartment and sat down looking out the window he saw the woman again holding ginny hand the twins rejoined their mother and sister and made fun of their brothers there harry laughed at their antics it felt so good to be away from the dursleys then they announced that they had met him on the train the harry potter he heard ginny plead with her mother to go on the train and see him he did not find the idea repulsive some part of him had already decided ginny was his friend his first besides hagrid ginny started to cry and laugh at the same time as the train started to move she ran after it waving harry stuck his head slightly out of the window and raised his hand ginny momentarily locked eyes with him and raised her own hand he could have sworn he heard someone say bye harry harry shook himself today was turning out to be very strange a mysterious letter a friend a wall that not a wall going to a wizarding school on a train his thoughts were derailed by one of the redheads he had seen on the platform he recongized the boy as ginny brother although he could not remember the boy name so anyone sitting here everywhere else if full he asked harry shook his head i ron weasley the boy said extending his hand harry took it and smiled i harry harry potter your ginny brother right ron looked strange for a moment and then said yeah you met ginny on the platform the conversation progressed from there back at kings cross ginny and molly weasley were climbing back into the car and pulling out of the parking lot was that really harry potter yes i think so answered molly and chuckled it looked like her daughter had developed a crush ginny did not say another word for the rest of the trip home which was strange for her ginny was far more interested with what was playing out in her head it was almost like she was hearing someone else thoughts and voices first she thought she heard ron say something and looked around forgetting ron was gone then she heard the other voice i harry harry potter your ginny brother right her eyes went wide she could not believe it was possible she had to be going crazy there was no possible way that she could be hearing harry and no one had ever referred to one of her brothers as ginny brother no it was always you re so and so little sister it made her sound more important than her brothers ginny blushed she listened intently as ron tried to turn scabbers yellow and failed she heard a bossy voice tell ron he had dirt on his nose and that they should put on their robes she strange was what harry thought about the voice every now and then ginny would even see what harry saw ginny smiled if this continued it was going to be a very interesting year harry stepped out of the train and waved to hagrid ron joined him in one of the small boats along with the boy who had lost his toad neville harry thought his name was and the bushy haired girl hermione as the boats came around the bend they got their first view of hogwarts amazing thought harry and again thought he heard a girl voice say it fantastic which had been quickly followed by you like the pie dear harry shook his head he d been hearing things ever since about half way through the train ride by now he had placed the predominate voice ginny harry waited nervously to be sorted he could not help it what if i not chosen at all merlin that is an awful thought at least you re there harry smiled something about the voice cheered him up harry heard his name called and was so nervous that he did not notice that everyone had gone deathly quiet and then the great hall erupted again in murmurings and whispers he put the hat on what this harry potter hmmm how interesting how interesting indeed never heard of this happening to one so young i wonder has someone been meddling ah well no matter now let sort out who who here here you are harry lot of potential i see and a thirst to prove your self oh yes oh my but you are a difficult one to place you could do great things in slytherin you know harry thought not slytherin not slytherin another slightly less loud voice echoed his hmmm it seems there is agreement about that at least chuckled the sorthing hat you two are gonig to be interesting to watch well if not slytherin then it better be gryffindor the hat screamed out the house name and harry quickly moved to the correct table harry was lying in his new bed it was far more luxurious than anything he had ever slept on before hogwarts already felt like home more than the privet drive ever did i cantbelieve they treated you so badly how could they the voice was full of caring and concern and underneath that though was anger but not at him before harry could stop himself he thought back to the voice in this head it wasntso bad i learned to stay out of the way i here now though harry felt shock that was not his own and was shocked in turn is this for real the voice was small now tentative oh boy thought harry harry ginny how do we know this is real for sure can i send you a letter of course just owl me how write a note to me just say it real dontsign it either mum will have a fit if she finds out about this she d probably think i was crazy and cart me off to st mungo s oh about the owl just tie the note to an owl leg put my name on the outside of the envelope will do what st mungo s wizards hospital oh good night ginny good night harry in his mind harry could hear a giggle he chuckled himself he had been worried about not knowing what kids who had been raised as wizards and witches knew now he had one inside his head harry sent hedwig off in the morning with the note to ginny and then went down to breakfast classes were amazing harry decided ron was great and harry did not have people staring at him because they hated him although they did stare at him during classes he could feel ginny paying attention drinking in the lessons she would even offer advice when he was in transfiguration she had said focus harry mom says magic is in the intent as much as the words and wand movement intend for the match to become a needle by the end of class he had succeeded in turning his match into a needle which earned him a rare smile from mcgonagall hermione glared at him she had been the only other person in the class to get the match to change at all his other classes were much like that as well ginny was a great help she picked up on details that harry glossed over harry was right about the potions professor he did not like harry at all he could hear ginny think greasy git and choked back a cough professor snape had started drilling harry with questions but by the third question ginny was ready what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane snape sneered out harry could hear ginny asking her mom nothing harry they re the same plant er nothing sir they are the same snape stopped moving in shock and his eyes narrowed the professor looked like he was trying to see into harry soul draco malfoy was worse than dudley harry could not believe it nor could ginny and now he was sneaking through the dark hallways after curfew to duel him and he did not know one spell ron was with him which was good somehow he had managed to pick up two others hermione and neville harry felt sorry for neville and without neville remembrall he would not be on the quidditch team that was some impressive flying harry cheeks blushed in the dark thanks ginny how am i going to make it through this duel i dontknow one spell besides ron who had quickly become his best friend at hogwarts harry had come to rely on ginny for advice and she had become his closest confidant not that he really had a choice he did not understand how they were talking but he would not give it up for the world now when hedwig had returned with the one line message from ginny very real he had not really known what to do his first thought had been i have a girl in my head which ginny had giggled at but as time went on ginny helped him with classes and her presence gave him more self confidence it was like having someone with you all the time i ve got a spell announced ginny harry smiled he could hear the mischievousness and pride in her voice bill told me about it it involves bats and bogeys ok the incantations is by the end of the night harry was very ready for bed it had been a long day first he had nearly been expelled but had made the quidditch team instead then he had been challenged by the greatest prat imaginable to a duel of course the prat being a prat did not show and he had nearly been caught by filch finally he had nearly been eaten by a huge three headed dog it was definitely time for bed harry was smiling looking down at his small pile of presents you know this is the first time i ve actually looked forward to christmas happy christmas harry greeted ginny how christmas in romania harry had actually known that ron and the others were staying at hogwarts before they did it beautiful but cold very cold harry laughed and continued opening his presents he had been very pleased with the sweater from mrs weasley and had now moved on to a present with no name ron and ginny were just as interested as he was when he put the cloak on and looked into the mirror to only see his head he gasped wow harry it really is an invisibility cloak harry felt ginny smirk do you realize the kind of pranks you could pull with one of these awesome that night harry found himself under the cloak running from filch after a doomed trip to the restricted section that ginny was still giggling at hermione was going to be disappointed that he had not found flamel but he had not expected the book to actually scream to make it worse snape was also patrolling the corridors ginny had stopped giggling when she heard snape voice her dislike for snape was only matched by snape dislike for harry he hid inside what he thought was an empty room it looked like a very old ornate mirror walking to stand in front of it harry noticed it really did not seem to belong in the room indeed it looked like someone had placed it there to get it out of the way he nearly fell backwards in shock when he looked into it it was not his reflection at all it was ginny in one of the dark corners of the room albus dumbledore eyes widened in shock and it took all of his substantial self control not to gasp aloud he had thought of many possible things that harry would see in the mirror but a small girl was not one of them dumbledore watched in amazement as harry stared at the mirror in shock and then tried to talk to the image he had to stifle a small laugh the laugh faded when harry began to act like he was having a conversation every once in while he would say a one word answer or an i dontknow dumbledore forehead crinkled in thought to dumbledore complete astonishment harry only came back to see the mirror once and it seemed to be more out of fascination than need even the resulting discussion with harry had been strange when he had told him the mirror of erised showed your deepest desire harry eyes had widened and his face flushed dumbledore could only guess that harry had developed a crush a very deep crush shaking his head he left for his office and wondered who the girl was she was not a student he knew so he had no idea how harry had even met her but if she was his greatest desire then dumbledore would have to find out who she was harry was too important for dumbledore to ignore this still lost in thought dumbledore headed to his quarters thinking that young mr potter was full of surprises madam pomfrey bustled around the hospital wing she could not believe a first year student had managed to suffer a case of magical exhaustion but if the rumors were true well rumors were rumors dumbledore watched harry sleeping he was still berating himself he had never intended to allow harry to face voldemort alone but the boy had done admirably well and had held of quirell long enough his only concern was that harry might have mental problems he kept mumbling to ginny in his sleep dumbledore shook his head trying to clear it harry had displayed huge potential this year much more potential than he had expected harry to indeed perhaps too much potential he was even giving miss granger some competition dumbledore had taken to watching harry occasionally while he was in class and sometimes it seemed that he was getting advice or talking to someone else he would try a spell and then wait sometimes moving his wand differently or saying the incantation with different emphasis ginny oh i ve got a headache oh harry you re alright it was awful i thought you were going to die then you kinda woke up and only mumbled nonsense please dontdo that again i don t i dontknow what i d do without having you to talk to i dontwant to be alone harry reached out with his mind trying to reassure ginny you re never alone i here i ll never leave neither of us is ever alone remember that his eyes slowly closed and he fell into a real sleep comforted by ginny now sending her own reassurance to him back in the burrow ginny smiled as she felt comfort flowing from harry they had learned that they could share what they were feeling as well as speaking to each other harry was depressed he was going back to the dursleys for the summer and there was nothing good about it at least they didntknow he couldntdo magic there were only two bright spots first ron had said that he could visit the burrow ron home sometime during the summer the other one was that ginny had told him that she would be on the platform with her mother molly weasley was concerned her daughter had been acting strangely all year ever since ron had left for hogwarts she was strangely quiet and seemed far away much of the time on halloween her daughter had screamed suddenly then again not a week ago she was in her room and she had screamed harry for the next day she had been extremely anxious and worried when mrs weasley had heard about her son and harry adventures she had become suspicious she did not know how her daughter knew what had happen and begun to suspect the possibility that ginny was a seer mrs weasley shook her head one thing was for certain though ginny was excited to have ron and the others back from hogwarts she was practically bouncing as she waited on the platform mrs weasley soon changed her mind it was not ron or any of ginny brothers the young girl was eager to see but harry potter the two had greeted each other shyly and shook hands both of them were blushing mrs weasley wondered what was going on her daughter had only received one unknown owl a snowy white and she saw that it was the same bird that accompanied harry she wondered if there had been more owls than she had been aware of she watched as harry with a look of dejection on his face made his way over to some muggles she assumed were his family oh they dontlook like good muggles at all she was surprised when her daughter had absently said no they aren t ginny eyes were narrowed and she wore an expression mrs weasley had never seen on her face she thought it just might be hate albus dumbledore watched unobserved as harry greeted the young red headed girl it was the same girl that was in the mirror dumbledore eyes widened as the young ginny reacted the same way as harry was it only a crush dumbledore shook his head in confusion he would have to watch both of them very carefully next year a n chapter 14 is up look for an update next monday i will try updating weekly every monday as it gives me the weekend to do some serious typing just a quick note kreacher did not spill the beans about the prophecy dumbledore hasnttold anyone but kreacher has spilled the beans about the order guarding the door to the dom a lot is going to be happening between now and christmas so i not sure how many chapters it is going to end up as thanks for all the great reviews i enjoy reading them and they keep me motivated disclaimer refer to chapter 1 chapter 14 a ferret and a toad dumbledore hung back from the party he watched with a small smile on his face as ron weasley eagerly ripped the brown paper off what was obviously a broom mr weasley was having a good day dumbledore knew unlike harry and ginny ron mind was not as well protected against even passive legilimancy while he was mostly radiating happiness about the new broom he was also happy about being a lion dumbledore smiled and wondered if two old marauders had anything to do with this new development he knew that he would have to wait for one of them to tell him both of them had rudimentary understanding of occulumency probably from years of lying about pranks alastor was showing something it looked like a picture to harry and judging from ginny reaction harry was not reacting well to it the young lady had moved from the opposite side of the room and had nonchalantly placed a supporting hand on harry shoulder albus can we talk for a moment remus lupin had managed to sneak up on him dumbledore nodded wondering what the former professor had to say harry been having dreams about the department of mysteries he described the hallway perfectly for me dumbledore closed his eyes took a deep breath and made sure to exhale extra long before replying i was afraid the connection was growing stronger dumbledore admitted has alastor setup everything for the trip to kings cross remus nodded affirmatively good i ll talk to them before i go albus is everything alright remus asked concern the headmaster look reminded him of what he looked like a few days after the full moon just tired i ve been spending much of my time trying to prevent the ministry from appointing a defense against the dark arts professor but i have not succeeded remus silently asked who it was dolores umbridge dumbledore said sadly remus face fell she an awful woman yes that is what i need to talk to them about especially harry and ginny she will try and provoke them dumbledore smiled sadly at remus and made his way to the table excuse me but i need to talk to the dumbledore momentarily wondered what to call them children was no longer the correct term students for a moment although he did not raise his voice everyone quieted down you might have heard that i have had some difficulty in finding a defense professor sadly i have not been able to find one and the ministry has appointed dolores umbridge as professor she is the senior undersecretary of magic i know that each of you has been following the papers and realize the minister fudge does not believe lord voldemort almost everyone flinched has returned i want all of you to be very careful around professor umbridge do not allow her to provoke you as i am sure alastor will remind you be careful what you put into writing and assume all owls will be intercepted do you understand everyone nodded harry tried to meet dumbledore eyes but the professor refused to his feelings of guilt and worry tripled ginny looked at harry and then at dumbledore harry quit feeling guilty but i dontknow what i did protested harry ginny had had enough if she could stand up to her mother then she could confront dumbledore audience or no she wondered if she would be able to control her temper ginny dontit professor called ginny as dumbledore turned to leave dumbledore unnoticeably stiffened he knew that tone indeed it seemed to be becoming a tradition to be chewed out by the youngest weasley turning around to face the young lady he said yes ms weasley ever direct ginny went straight to the point why wontyou look harry in the eye instead of immediately answering dumbledore moved back to the table and sat down and looked ginny in the eye i dontknow what you re talking about he knew it was a mistake before he finished ginny had turned red dontyou dare you know exactly what you re doing ginny was not yelling but her volume was only just below that do you know how harry feeling he hasntdone anything wrong you are the one who wrong it not harry fault that voldemort came back he didnteven want to even be in the stupid tournament he didnt hire a death eater as a professor he didntchoose to live with relatives that are beyond awful you haventhad your life threatened every year ginny continued for another five minutes at one point once she had gotten over the initial shock mrs weasley had moved to grab her daughter and pull her back into her chair but harry had stood to stand by ginny her hand had met with an invisible barrier harry had turned to look at her and his look clearly said that he would not allow anyone to touch ginny when ginny had started berating dumbledore harry had wanted to crawl under the table but when he noticed mrs weasley begin to reach for her daughter harry knew he could not allow her to intervene it was a simple decision for him ginny did not want to be stopped and he knew it was important to her dumbledore had not planned on anyone forcing his hand this quickly he was sure severus was going to complain mightily when he informed him i fear that voldemort might use the connection he and harry have to spy on me on us shocked silence greeted dumbledore words he continued i believe it is possible for voldemort to force his way into harry mind much like he did to you with the diary this time several people began speaking at once and dumbledore held his hands up for silence i believe that if you are willing to learn harry voldemort can be blocked harry watched dumbledore carefully and wondered idly if dumbledore was saying voldemort name so many times to try and sensitize the group would you be willing to learn occulumency of course answered harry why wouldnti he added mentally excellent dumbledore said as he stood then professor snape will be in contact shortly he immediately made for the door it was not until after dumbledore was gone that the shocked crowd fully realized what he had said i can think of one reason snape oh this is going to be pleasant do you mind if i sit this one out harry rolled his eyes oh harry i so sorry hermione said she was the first to break the silence the trip to kings cross was uneventful sirius had accompanied them for the trip in his animagus form over the objections of mrs weasley mad eye moody had also initially objected but when sturgis podmore had not shown he had decided that sirius would make up the missing number in harry guard harry smiled and waved at the large shaggy black dog running after the train watching sirius enjoying himself harry temporarily was able to forget all the finger pointing and whispering he had received on the platform it appeared that a lot of his classmates had been reading the daily prophet he enjoying being out ginny said breaking into his thoughts laughing harry agreed yeah let go find a compartment dontworry about all of them harry if they think your crazy and avoid you then it just means more time with me harry smiled at her logic and put an arm around her as they walked down the train looking for an empty compartment hermione and ron had already left to attend their prefect meeting at the last carriage they met neville hey neville how was your summer asked harry neville smiled at harry they had become better friends last year pretty good except for all the rubbish that was in the daily prophet about you and dumbledore you should have seen gran when a reporter came to our place asking for a comment i thought she was going to hex him on the spot the three of them laughed at the image neville grandmother was formidable from only the brief glimpses they had had of her on platform 9 over the years neither harry nor ginny would want to be on her bad side this compartment has space only luna is in it ginny said neville looked at her strangely and then looked at the compartment in doubt harry turned to see what neville was worried about in the compartment sat a girl probably ginny age and harry understood immediately why neville hesitated this luna gave off an aura of dottiness the radishes hanging from her ears and the butterbeer cap necklace did not help how do you know luna met her during my first year i talk to her when i run into her she a bit strange but you ll like her how come i dont know her luna doesnt always leave a lasting impression unless you are talking to her it kinda strange but then so is luna can we join you luna asked ginny as she opened the compartment door luna looked up from her newspaper which harry noticed was upside down she looked at the three of them and smiled dreamily of course sit several minutes later harry decided ginny was right luna was nice but strange the conversation he had tried to have with her had gone nowhere or rather the conversation had gone beyond harry grasp of reality he turned to neville who had happily avoided luna direct gaze are you looking forward to this year harry asked eager for a conversation he could follow neville smile grew wider yeah my great uncle even bought me this plant mimbulus mimbletonia is its name here hold trevor harry took hold of the toad and watched as neville took out a quill it supposed to have a defense system so if i poke it like this green smelly goo shot out everywhere neville was covered as was harry who could not protect himself as he was holding trevor ginny had thrown her hands up in time to shield her from the worst of it and luna newspaper was now green ginny stood and waved her wand and said scourgify cleaning the goo off everyone and the compartment a moment later the compartment door opened and ginny turned to see an older girl with asian features and long shiny black hair ginny recognized her as the ravenclaw seeker cho chang hi harry how are you she asked ignoring ginny neville and luna completely ginny eyes narrowed she did not care for the look in cho eyes er i okay how re you cho harry was confused cho was looking at him strangely and batting her eyelashes at him he was even more confused by the hostility he felt from ginny then he was hit by a huge wave of possessiveness ginny fingered her wand and walked so that she was just in front of harry hi cho have a good summer she asked in an overly polite voice as she did so ginny sat down in harry lap harry blushed at ginny provocative position and after a mental prod from ginny tentatively put his arms around her so that she would not slide off a small blush crept up cho neck but she smiled back at ginny and said it was okay considering anyway i ll see you later harry i d like to talk to you more she turned so that her hair flew over her shoulder ginny watched her go with a frown and felt doubt flash across her mind harry was harry but he was also the boy who lived handsome nice rich and powerful and she was just ginny weasley ginny potter harry corrected ginny blushed embarrassed at her thoughts harry have you ever doubted you know that i haven t besides i the one whose not worthy of you dontbe ridiculous harry you re then you stop being ridiculous harry said with finality ginny maneuvered herself so that she was straddling his lap neville and luna watched mesmerized as ginny leaned towards harry and kissed him the couple hands did not seem to rest harry started out buried in ginny hair but then moved down her sides her back her bum and back up to her hair ginny hands were out of sight but also moving several minutes later luna turned to neville and asked in her dreamy voice do you think they need to stop to breathe or do you think they can breathe through their hair like the crumpled horn snorkack neville looked at luna opened his mouth shut his mouth and then blinked eventually he simply settled for a shrug i dontknow either agreed luna a loud groan came from the compartment door do you have to do that ron and hermione had returned from their prefect meeting harry and ginny stopped kissing and looked at ron and hermione ginny smiled wickedly and leaned against harry so that her cheek was on his shoulder why does it bother you ron groaned again but did not say anything hermione looked at ron like he had grown a second head but also did not say anything an awkward silence developed ron wanted to talk about when he was going to begin practicing his transformation but he knew better than to say anything luckily luna distracted him you re ronald weasley ron blinked yeah you did not dance at the ball luna stated ron looked a little flustered everyone had stopped talking to watch the interaction yeah he said again i would have danced with you luna again made a statement ron forehead furrowed harry looked from the confused ron to hermione who was staring at luna newspaper with a look of disgust on her face check out the look on hermione face i ve never seen her look at a book well newspaper like that before ginny giggled in response slid off harry lap and took the seat beside him what are you reading luna she asked hermione gave a slight huff further conversation was caught off by a cold drawling voice emanating from the hallway ah here a good one albus dumbledore recent speech before the wizengamot further proves that the persistent rumors concerning the once great man sanity are true his blind faith in the attention seeking harry potter who seems to have had one too many brushes with death also lends credence to the belief that the man who once defeated grindelwald is no longer competent to run hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ha that one really is good but the stuff about potter is even better well look who we have here potter and some other losers draco malfoy said as he noticed them as usual crabbe and goyle flanked him but today he was also accompanied by several other slytherins who harry recognized but did not remember their names malfoy sneered as he faced harry potter was all he said before his face changed he smiled the smile made harry blood run cold sneers he was used to but malfoy smiling could not be good you had better watch your step this year things are going to be different malfoy smile widened dumbledore cantprotect you anymore for a moment harry thought malfoy was going to walk away before saying anything too insulting and then he sniffed his nose crinkled as if he smelled a foul odor uhhg how can you stand it in here the mudblood reeks hermione blushed a deep crimson harry opened his mouth to tell malfoy to shut up ginny fingered her wand and was edging to the side to get a clear shot however it was ron who acted first ron fist swung towards malfoy but the slytherin had been expecting this reaction and simply stepped back allowing the compartment door to automatically close ron fist slammed through the glass slicing his hand to ribbons malfoy laughed and led his entourage from the compartment son of a ron was swearing as he cradled his hand blood dripping to the floor one of these days i going to get malfoy just wait he such a ron words trailed off as he continued to fantasize about what he planed to do to malfoy hermione had rushed to his side her wand drawn she pointed it at his hand and said fasciaus bandages wound around his hand stopping the bleeding thanks hermione ron mumbled oh ron you re a prefect now you need to learn to control your temper you cant just get mad at malfoy now he a prefect too now dontworry about your hand when we get to hogwarts madam pomfrey will fix it right up hermione continued to hover over ron for the rest of the trip leaving harry to fix the window hermione and ron left the group when the train arrived at hogsmeade to perform their prefect duties harry froze as he approached the carriage the horseless carriages were no longer horseless or well he supposed the black creatures with leathery wings could be considered horses what are those things he asked to no one in particular what things asked neville curiously harry pointed to the winged horses latched to the nearest carriage oh those they ve always been there what harry stupidly said i can see them too came luna voice from behind them making them all jump slightly ginny was peering at the space with squinted eyes she brought her hand up and rubbed her eyes as if she was trying to clear them what is it ginny it like i can see them but i can t it like the haze you see on a hot day above the pavement the air sort of shimmers where you say the horses are ron and hermione did not show to share a carriage with them and harry figured that they had already gone ahead to get ron hand healed harry looked around again before allowing the carriage to depart just in case but when he did not see them he closed the door and the ugly horse like creatures began moving did anyone see hagrid asked ginny with a perplexed expression i just realized i didnthear him calling the first years oh he was not there professor grubbly plank was there she a much better professor anyway luna informed them dreamily and then went back to her paper that not true protested harry and ginny at the same time yeah hagrid a great teacher supported neville luna looked up from her paper and looked at them with her large eyes okay if you think so was all she said dumbledore eyed the pensive hesitantly there were few things that dumbledore hated he did not hate voldemort he pitied him true the atrocities lord voldemort committed were heinous but dumbledore simply could not bring himself to hate the creature that had been the small orphan albeit misguided tom riddle this did not mean he did not wish voldemort to die indeed he had been striving for that objective or something akin to it for many years what dumbledore hated was the prophecy riddle made his own choices that would lead to his downfall but harry could not the prophecy took away harry choice the boy would either fight and die or fight and live in some ways the prophecy made it easy on dumbledore harry fate was already determined it was his job to make sure harry defeated voldemort he knew that harry life had been miserable but it had also made him stronger for years now he had been able to soothe his conscience with the knowledge that the prophecy forbid harry from truly living until voldemort had been killed yet he was puzzled and he wondered not for the first time how a soul bond could form with the weight of prophecy dumbledore mused that this was definitely living and living more intensely than most ever got the chance to ms weasley or ms potter he supposed had made him feel rather guilty severus had not taken the news that he would be teaching harry potter occulumency well but he was going to do it he sighed and his gaze shifted back to the pensive he wanted to review the prophecy one more time he had it memorized by now and had not bothered to look at it since well before harry had come to hogwarts but hearing it in the original may yield something new and he wanted to be prepared for when he did tell harry the wand caused the memories to spin and when the finally settled dumbledore was ready and he watched a younger sybil trelawney give the prophecy it had been well over a decade since albus dumbledore had last cursed tonight albus dumbledore cursed what the bloody hell dumbledore sat down heavily in the large chair and watched the students walking into the great hall he was still mystified by what he had seen to add to his problems dolores umbridge was seated at the head table as well dumbledore sighed deeply it was going to be a long year and now he had another mystery to figure out harry went through the doors of the great hall feeling apprehensive he hated being stared at whispers were even worse and finger pointing was the worst he expected all three a hand grabbed his and squeezed a warm comforting feeling surged through the linked hands ginny led him to a seat at the gryffindor table ignoring the stares whispers and finger pointing the noise in the great hall quieted when professor mcgonagall walked in leading the new students harry took the time to look at the head table merlin she looks like a toad further speech from ron who had just sat down was cut off by a jab in the ribs by hermione harry could not help but agree with ron the only new professor had to be dolores umbridge and she did look like a toad with a fly perched precariously on top of her head ginny snickered picking up on his thoughts ron interrupted further thought about the new defense against the dark arts professor by his consistent grumblings about hunger the welcoming feast was as delicious as always and soon dumbledore was rising to his feet to give his speech he had just reached the point where he was going to announce quidditch tryouts when a barely audible hem hem could be heard coming from umbridge direction ginny leaned back against harry as umbridge droned on and tuned the woman out she noticed harry was doing much the same as he wordlessly looked around the great hall at the other students blank expressions as far as she could tell only hermione was paying full attention ron was looking at his empty plate with a disgruntled expression and periodically would shake his head as if he was trying to stay awake and so it is with great pride and hope for a better education here at hogwarts that i now announce the new position of hogwarts high inquisitor i will happily be filling the post thank you umbridge sat down with a small smile at the professors shocked expressions only dumbledore did not seem surprised dumbledore stood once more and ignored the smug umbridge as best he could but he could not resist a slight barb i do hope that everyone will be able to sleep tonight after that energizing speech from professor umbridge now as i was saying quidditch tryouts will be held as they made their way to gryffindor tower ginny for the most part ignored hermione but harry tried to engage hermione in conversation the little conversation they held was strained harry was not sure what to say and he was reluctant to talk about anything serious for her part hermione was not sure what to say to help repair the broken trust between them they were both relieved when she had to attend to her prefect duties since ron obviously was not going to do them by himself or if he did would do them badly move it you midgets harry heard ron voice say which was quickly followed by hermione stern reprimanding voice and a smack hey that hurt but hermione they are midgets pleaded ron voice harry and ginny laughed as ron and hermione immediately began bickering in front of the huddled first years harry motioned to the group to follow him and harry and ginny led them to the tower the bickering couple did not notice until they were alone in the hallway arriving at the portrait of the fat lady ginny explained that they had to give her the password before they could enter it was only then that they realized that they did not know it surprisingly it was neville who strode confidently forward i know the password and i wont forget this one he said with evident pride in his voice mimbulus mimbletonia the portrait swung open and this time it was neville who led everyone into the common room pavarti can you show the girls up to their side of their tower parvarti nodded at neville thanks all right the boys dormitory is this way follow me harry and ginny exchanged a look neither had ever seen neville so confidant hermione and ron found eventually found their own way back to the common room to find it empty except for fred and george who looked guilty for a moment and then posted a flyer on the board hermione frowned and tore it down when the twins had left she sat down heavily by ron i cant believe them they cantdo this but hermione they are paying them and ron leaned over to look at the flyer and paying them well hermione huffed that not the point they re breaking the rules ron shifted at her last words life is not just about rules hermione paled at his words realizing that her reasoning was the same as her argument with harry i mean it not just the rules they could hurt someone we cantallow that hermione finished this time it was ron who paled at her words we the thought of facing the twins was not appealing frowning at his reluctance yes we as in you and me you re a prefect ron groaned and put his head in his hands the next morning harry wondered down to the common room to find a waiting fred and george he did not care for the way they were looking at him he looked around for some help ron and hermione were leading the first years to breakfast no help there that really only left one source of possible help ginny help relax harry i ve already talked with the two twits this morning they wonthurt you and if they do they will regret it are you sure harry dear boy fred interrupted his mental conversation with ginny it has come to our attention that your relationship with our sister our little sister mind you is getting serious inserted george fred put an arm around harry shoulders yes but it is not exactly unexpected ron really is a dunce what concerns us is that both of you are getting older ranging hormones you know said george as he winked at harry harry mentally groaned he could not believe that the twins of all people were about to give him the talk about their little sister it not like we think you ll do something that you ll regret or at least something that we d be forced to make you regret said fred harry was starting to get a little dizzy from their back and forth which is why we wanted to give you this talk that and we like you harry after all you gave us our startup money we ve been putting it to good use you ve seen the flyers right some of the stuff we ve come up with is absolutely phenomenal wait till you see george focus chided fred but he did not sound angry now getting back to the issue at hand harry walked into the great hall in a daze sitting down next to an equally dazed ginny he started to absently pile food onto his plate i cantbelieve they just did that ginny patted his thigh you re telling me i have a whole new respect for them said harry truthfully ginny laughed lightly yeah who knew fred and george were so experienced it sure was a different talk than what sirius gave me the talk with the twins had alternated between graphic descriptions of how certain acts should be done and threats as to what would be done if such acts were ever performed dontworry if they touch you i ll make them wish they were never born harry looked up from his plate long enough to see hermione passing out timetables but returned to his food oh no you have to be kidding me ginny said exasperated we have double potions and double defense today at least ancient runes is in the middle count yourselves lucky i ve got divination today too said ron darkly as he glared at the offending schedule at least we donthave potions first do you really think that this umbridge woman is going to be any better than professor snape after what dumbledore said and then her speech last night hissed hermione at ron trying to keep her voice low let go we dont want to be late said harry as he stood and gathered his things the class filed into the room silently and took their seats and waited for umbridge to arrive everyone had taken out the required book and their wands it was the first time harry had paid any attention to the new book that mrs weasley or some other order member had obtained for him he stared at the book with wonder defensive magical theory he looked questionably at ginny but she only shrugged her shoulders harry flipped through the textbook it looked as bad as its title to his left ron was no help either as he was staring mindlessly at the door the class did not have long to wait professor umbridge stoically walked into the classroom although she was trying hard to keep emotion from her face it was evident from the red flush on her neck she was irritated the class remained quiet as she was as of yet an unknown quantity for her part professor umbridge paid the class no heed as she sat at her desk and then said good morning books out wands away the class groaned in unison the command wands away was never a sign of an interesting class tut tut that wont do umbridge said as she looked up and examined the class harry stifled a laugh and he saw ginny stick a fist in her mouth to do the same professor umbridge was wearing a fluffy pink cardigan and had a black velvet bow on top of her head it gave the impression of a large pink toad with a large fly dangerously perched on it for the next ten minutes umbridge rambled on about how deficient their previous teaching had been and how it was now going to be improved with a ministry approved syllabus ah yes now i want everyone to read the prefix and chapter one for today umbridge said finishing her introductory speech the class solemnly opened their books and began reading this is worse than binns complained harry yeah not even hermione reading replied ginny who was now watching hermione with interest the other girl had raised her hand and harry noticed that umbridge was determinedly not looking at her the rest of the class soon joined them in watching hermione silent struggle to get umbridge to call upon her do you have a question about the chapter miss granger ma am hermione granger and no i don t i have a hermione answered but was interrupted we are reading the chapter now miss granger umbridge curtly said but i have a query about your course aims pleaded hermione umbridge face changed to suspicion as she answered you do they seem quite simple to me yes ma am it just that they dontsay that we will actually be practicing any defensive magic hermione answer seem to irritate umbridge and stun the rest of the class who were now examining the course aims with a great deal of suspicion you will have no reason to use defense spells in my class you are not going to be attacked said umbridge you re kidding blurted ron umbridge swiveled her head to look at ron who stared defiantly back you must raise your hand in my class if you are going to speak mr weasley ron said has he shoved his hand into the air umbridge turned away from him only to be confronted with half the class hands up yes miss pavarti patil arentwe going to practice any magic there a practical portion on our o w l s after all so long as you learn and study the theory you will do fine on your exams umbridge said testily you mean the first time we use a spell will be at an exam asked a shocked dean thomas hand it should not be a problem as long as you know the theory umbridge repeated to the shocked class i understand that some of your past professors have led you to think that using defensive magic is necessary but this is not the case i hear your past professor actually used them on you yeah well he turned out to be a maniac too muttered dean hand i wont remind you again what your name um dean thomas yes and then there was that dark creature again she was interrupted professor lupin is not a dark creature ginny voice held a note a steel in it and harry unconsciously pulled his wand out hmph was the reply from umbridge half breeds have no place teaching what is your name ginny eyes narrowed in intense dislike ginny weasley and professor lupin was the best professor we ve had harry could feel ginny anger increasing as she locked eyes with umbridge but sighed when umbridge did not say anything more to provoke her yes well the only professor you ve had that has followed the proscribed ministry guidelines was professor quirell harry could not believe his ears you ve got to be kidding he said without thinking giving voice to his and ginny thoughts hand umbridge eyes narrowed as she looked at him mr potter harry had had enough and continued although he did raise his hand yeah quirell was great except for the drawback of having lord voldemort sticking out the back of his head silence reigned and he felt of jolt of pride as umbridge flinched at the name but she soon recovered detention tonight mr potter for spreading nasty lies professor quirell had an unfortunate mishap that led to his death you know who is not alive nor has ever been to this school both harry and ginny snorted but ginny was louder yes miss weasley do you have something to add harry knew that ginny was about to get herself into trouble he did not blame her as his temper rising in tandem with hers he quickly decided to say something before she did they re not lies voldemort has returned umbridge flinched again at the name but nastily smiled detention for a week and do not say you know who name harry sighed and barely controlled the urge to scream ginny attempt to control here own temper failed why only harry and ron knew that there was trouble when ginny took that particular tone ron was pushing his desk backwards with his outstretched legs trying to move as far away from ginny and umbridge as possible why what said a flustered umbridge why cantwe say the name professor harry stared at ginny in awe and wondered how she made the word professor sound like an insult professor umbridge composure flickered for a few seconds as she tried to respond because it is because it is not polite the name it um would you prefer tom riddle harry sucked in his breath and he heard hermione and ron gasp what umbridge asked clearly confused ginny pulled out her wand and harry held his breath hoping that she would not hex umbridge he could feel that she was sorely tempted he did not know if he felt relieved when she began tracing tom marvolo riddle in the air ginny smiled evilly and then waved her wand the letters quickly rearranged themselves to read i am lord voldemort he did go to hogwarts fifty years ago ginny said icily if you are wrong about this what makes you think your right about that is enough how dare you say such things you little strumpet watch your mouth said a calm commanding voice harry did not recognize it as his own voice and umbridge took a step backwards you will not speak to her in such a fashion the other students were now unconsciously leaning away from harry umbridge took another step backwards before she realized what she was doing ah yes hum things clearly had not gone how she had planned let me reiterate her voice took on the quality of a long rehearsed speech like during the welcoming feast the ministry of magic assures you that you know who has not returned and i supposed cedric diggory dropped dead of his own accord then said harry loudly umbridge gave him another nasty smile and then bent over her desk writing something before handing him a sealed scroll take this to professor mcgonagall leave now harry glared at her one last time and then left ginny did not say anything but her eyes had narrowed her temper had already past the point of angry and had settled on revenge for the rest of the class her eyes followed umbridge as she decided the best ways to make the toad life a living hell meanwhile harry thudded down the hallways toward professor mcgonagall office he was still angry and irritated but he was becoming less so as ginny began listing what she would like to do to umbridge do you really think we could turn her into a toad he asked intrigued by the idea not by ourselves but i sure we could convince fred and george to help harry smiled at the idea mr potter what are you doing out of class said a stern voice harry immediately recognized he turned and held out the scroll mcgonagall frown deepened as she read it she led him to her office it was not until the next class was about to begin was he allowed to leave harry did not notice professor dumbledore standing in the hallway darkened corner as he left oh hello albus i wasntexpecting you mcgonagall said as she began rearranging some papers on her desk today has been most informative morning i afraid i have some bad news dolores will begin inspecting the word was practically spat out professors starting next month i dontknow how long it will be until she forces me out oh albus surely she cantforce you to give up being headmaster pleaded mcgonagall forced out of hogwarts but not headmaster explained dumbledore but we do have some time fudge has granted her widespread powers i expect them to be announced within the next couple of weeks but let us move on to better subjects did you have a nice talk with young mr potter said albus mcgonagall sighed he needs to be more careful around dolores he received two weeks worth of detention in one day dumbledore chuckled yes he does but youth and impetuousness often go together however you should have seen him in class not even dumbledore could force out the amazement in his voice what do you mean asked an interested mcgonagall and what were you doing in that class a small smile lighted on dumbledore face you did not think i was going to miss dolores first class did you but back to harry when she insulted ms weasley his aura flared i ve never seen anything like it before he is becoming more powerful dumbledore ended simply and ms weasley is not to be underestimated she is powerful in her own right mcgonagall eyebrows rose but she did not comment this has been an awful day complained ron as they slowly walked to potions what are you complaining about i ve got two weeks of detention was harry rebuttal yeah but you dont have umbridge trelawney and snape in the same day you know trelawney predicted your death again and because i your friend she predicted mine again i dontknow what she would do if i wasntin class harry laughed at ron and kept walking uh oh said hermione under her breath they all looked up and saw a very irritated professor snape this is not going to be good she continued harry had to agree and took his usual seat besides ginny snape was indeed as nasty as ever as usual his vindictiveness was aimed at harry harry was impressed that both he and ginny had managed not to respond to any of snape barbs unfortunately their shared cauldron exploded at near the end of class what the harry exclaimed we did everything right ginny said to his left obviously not said an oily voice snape did not bother to hide the enjoyment in his voice potter i sure you re the cause of this disaster detention tonight harry felt his insides plummet i i cantsir i ve already got detention then tomorrow night responded snape harry sighed i ve got detention with professor umbridge for two weeks snape smiled crookedly oh my but you do have a full schedule harry realized that snape was enjoying his and groaned internally for this inconvenience you will have two detentions snape paused for effect for the next two mondays once your schedule is free a n the next chapter may take longer than a week to get out as i need to work on my outline i made a couple of changes to my outline that require me to think carefully about some of the upcoming chapters a few questions have been asked about hbp i will not be following the plot of hbp although i will use horcruxes it is a rather elegant solution to why voldemort did not die from the rebounded curse i wontbe saying to much more about horcruxes though you can wait until dumbledore explains i planning on picking up the speed the next chapter will hopefully go all the way to christmas oh and for those who haventnoticed i ve been spelling occlumency wrong occulumency were d that crazy u come from i ll go back and fix it when i get the time 11 3 2005 note on the next chapter it will be out no later than monday sorry about the wait but i seemed to have suffered from a rather bad bout of writer block disclaimer i dont own harry potter and everyone knows who does chapter 16 occlumency even potions could not put harry in a bad mood evidently the twins estimate of an hour was off target umbridge had remained a toad for a little over two hours it was not until the end of the class that harry mood dipped potter sneered snape harry looked up and snape sneer intensified i will expect you at seven tonight yes sir a few hours later harry found himself walking down the dimly lit corridor to snape office harry slowed his pace not wanting to arrive early he turned the corner and could see the door to snape office in the distance he walked even slower the door still came too quickly and he slowly raised his fist and knocked enter barked snape voice harry entered the office it was horrible it had only gotten worse since the last time he had been in it the office had every sort of gruesome creature that could be jammed into a jar there was barely enough light to see and a dank smell pervaded the room to make matters worse a sick yellowish colored potion was brewing off to the side harry hoped he was not going to be a test subject close the door behind you ordered snape the door closed with a click of finality when snape raised his wand and performed an imperturbable charm on the door harry felt his stomach clench in fear potter what do you know about occlumency snape sneered disgust evident in his tone harry momentarily marveled at how fast his mind could work as he pieced together what was happening you caused my cauldron to explode ginny i know i dontwant him to know neither do i it had been something they had discussed after hermione had told him that the best way to train in occlumency was to have someone attack your mind he did not want snape to know about his connection to ginny harry was afraid that even if he could block snape from seeing anything he might still be able to hear ginny talking they had decided that ginny would stay quiet throughout the lessons in order to avoid the issue if snape was able to find memories that revealed their bonding then well harry did not want to think about it an evil smirk appeared on snape face very good potter not as foolish as you look after all you are to tell no one of these lessons now tell me what do you know about occlumency realizing he was not there for detention harry answered snape relaying all the information hermione had told him he thought that an impressed look might have crossed snape eyes but it disappeared too quickly for him to be sure harry knew all too well the next expression that came to the potions professor face though it was the same one that he held every time he took points away or gave him detention good then i do not have to waste my time snape raised his wand looked harry directly in the eyes and cried legilimens the spell that hit harry like a physical blow and he stumbled backwards his vision swam and old memories began to surface he saw himself being chased by dudley gang at grammar school then aunt marge horrible dog ripper was chasing him he was ten and locked in his cupboard as uncle vernon yelled at him for being a freak shaking his head harry realized what was happening and tried to clear his mind of emotion and thought the pace of the memories slowed to a crawl and snape sneering face slowly reappeared although it was still fuzzy harry ability to push him out of his mind only seemed to spur the potions master forward though snape repeated the incantation without giving harry time to even breathe again there was the physical sensation of a blow and he took another step backwards under the onslaught he tried to clear his mind but this time snape mental probing brushed his attempt aside snape was once again going through his pre hogwarts memories harry did the only thing he could do and retreated before snape consciousness into ginny presence immediately the memories flashing before his eyes stopped and he saw snape standing before him snape had beads of sweat on his forehead you are better than i expected potter said snape a little breathlessly now go we will continue this in a week harry did not need any prodding his back to snape harry hurriedly made his way back to the tower behind him snape slumped heavily into his chair completely exhausted severus snape tried to jump out of the chair but found his body was too exhausted the attempt resulted in him slipping out of the chair onto the stone floor he looked up at albus dumbledore with an extremely irritated expression how was the lesson snape face contorted into barely concealed fury which then slipped into irritation as he realized he could not yell at dumbledore the boy is a natural as you can see his voice slipped into a sneer i am exhausted it took everything i had to push through his barriers and then dumbledore leaned forward slightly and then he just pushed me out i ve never experienced anything like it one moment i was in his mind the next i was not the sneering tone had left his voice and all that remained was disgust at being beaten by a student i dontthink the boy will ever be able to learn occlumency what he doing now is something snape seemed to grope for words different he ended lamely anything else asked dumbledore snape gave him a searching look it probably means nothing but i was able to see only his memories before coming here there was a wall there snape gave dumbledore a disgruntled look it not a wall created by occlumency it stronger than my own shields against the dark lord snape took a breath but more formidable the last was barely audible but dumbledore heard it more formidable how interesting will you test him again dumbledore asked even more curious as his potions professor pulled himself back into his chair yes we must be sure snape said a nasty smile gracing his face dumbledore nodded knowing that if harry could resist a master legilimens like snape when he had eye contact and a wand then he would be able to keep voldemort out dumbledore pondered professor snape words as he made his way back to his office it seemed mr potter was full of mysteries he had so many questions and so few answers he had always known that harry and ginny had some form of natural occlumency but he should not have been able to resist severus attempts without even breaking a sweat dumbledore sighed and wished he could talk to nicolas or perenelle they could have told him much nicolas was one of the few people that dumbledore could ask for advice then there was the prophecy things were not making sense dumbledore almost turned around to ask severus to test harry again this week so that he could be sure the boy mind was secure dumbledore needed to know if the prophecy at the ministry had also changed and to do that he needed harry dumbledore allowed himself a moment of frustration at the situation even if harry mind was impermeable to voldemort there would still be the matter of getting him into the ministry fudge would not make things easy but dumbledore mused even if fudge refused there were other ways of gaining access to the ministry and to the prophecy he briefly considered increasing the guard again around the department of mysterious in light of the changed prophecy he discounted the idea though two guards would have to be enough there simply were not enough people in the order to add more as he walked past the defense corridor he heard a loud croak emanate from one of the classrooms dumbledore allowed a smile to cross his face as he continued to walk by he supposed that professor umbridge had gone back to claim something on her desk he would have to tell minerva for the remainder of the week professor umbridge spent most of her time as a toad three times she had entered the great hall for breakfast and left as a toad she escaped few classes without becoming a toad and not even her personal office was safe indeed by the end of the week umbridge had become paranoid and judging from some of the locations that umbridge had graced in her toad form harry suspected that the twins had some powder of their own for harry the best part was that umbridge spent so much time as a toad or trying to figure out how she was becoming a toad that she did not have time to take points away or give him detention ginny had wanted to give umbridge another dose of the powder but harry had convinced her to wait and save the powder so that they could spread it over the entire length of term she had agreed but insisted that they move on to the next prank that was why harry found himself in the corridor outside gryffindor tower harry raised his eyebrows in anticipation ginny had been formulating all sorts of ideas for umbridge that ranged from simple fun to the downright dangerous follow me was all she said as she led him down the hallway they were soon standing in front of a suit of armor in one of the heavily used corridors what are we oh harry said as he realized what ginny had planned the prank was not as devilish as turning umbridge into a toad but it could easily drive her mad if it was done right two hours later they were in a darkened corner of the great hall are we done he asked over the past two hours they had charmed a great many of the school suits of armor to respond to umbridge presence harry had to admire the plan if he had come up with it they would have charmed every suit they had come across but ginny plan called for charming them randomly in some corridors every suit was charmed in others only one or even none the end result was that umbridge would never know when a suit would react to her for tonight we need to do the sixth and seventh floors tomorrow ginny answered and you need to be more creative with your charms she chided laughing harry acknowledged the truth only compared to yours i cantwait to see umbridge face when the suit outside the classroom pleads for her hand in marriage ginny beamed at the compliment ginny charms had been far more diverse than his own harry charmed suits were fairly restricted to chanting insults or attempting to trip umbridge ginny s on the hand did not only ejaculate insults but would make dubious compliments her real masterpieces though were those she had charmed to move where harry tried to trip umbridge or lunged at her ginny would move their entire bodies these suits of armor would follow umbridge around making a nuisance of themselves by their presence others would follow her around moaning with their arms outstretched harry thought that she had got this idea from an old horror movie he had seen but thought the idea worked just as well with a suit of armor as with a wrapped mummy harry felt ginny small hand interlaced with his and she pulled him out of the great hall where are we going he asked the only answer he received was a feeling of anticipation and mischievousness radiating from her he followed ginny until they reached the sixth floor i thought we werentgoing to do the sixth and seventh floors until tomorrow ginny glared at him hush her grip on his hand tightened and she led him up the stairs to the seventh floor soon they were in front of the tapestry of barnabas the barmy when she began pacing in front of the opposite wall realization finally hit harry and he smiled as he finally interpreted ginny feelings correctly she gave him a seductive smile as they entered the plush room i thought we should test the room before we showed the others they entered the common room very late and well past curfew hermione was waiting for them what do you think she wants asked harry ginny eyes narrowed at the girl sitting in the chair with the book splayed across her lap i dontknow but if she is going to yell at us or ginny sent a mental image of a bat bogeyed hermione harry stifled a laugh hi i wanted to talk to you two hermione stated you dontsay harry responded flatly hermione smiled weakly i just wanted to make sure you did not do anything that will get you into trouble relax no one can prove it was us assured ginny smugly it doesntmatter if someone as in umbridge can prove you did anything she is going to suspect you and dumbledore said i dontcare what dumbledore said harry said angrily she getting everything she deserves irritation passed over hermione face of course she is but that is not the point there are other ways like teaching defense harry did not know why she was pressing him to teach defense after all he had already agreed please there nothing wrong with a little fun she is going to be horrible to harry no matter what he does so there no point in not extracting a little revenge retorted ginny but dumbledore dumbledore should never have allowed her to teach here he supposed to be this powerful wizard well it about time he actually used his power ginny said icily harry looked at her and put a hand on her shoulder trying to sooth some of her anger ginny opinion of dumbledore had always been rather dismal since she had found out that the old man had sent harry to live with the durlseys dumbledore behavior over the summer and forcing harry to take occlumency with professor snape had not improved her opinion hermione frowned and then said with a defeated tone i i understand i just dont want you to get into any more trouble harry rolled his eyes and said i donthave to go looking for trouble trouble finds me ginny giggled and hermione opened her mouth to protest but shut it when she realized she could not find a counter argument ginny leaned over and kissed harry goodnight see you in the morning wait both of them stopped and turned toward hermione they had thought she was done lecturing her voice dropped i spoke to sirius what asked harry how hermione rolled her eyes and pointed to the fire he used the fire can you believe it it was so dangerous and then umbridge almost caught him i sure of it hermione stop and explain commanded harry almost losing his temper it was ron who first saw him apparently sirius was popping his head into the fire for the past few hours hoping to find one of us oh i still cant believe he did something like that you know what he said he said you sent him a letter harry is this true you know what moody yes i did and moody just said not to put anything revealing into writing i didn t what did sirius have to say harry interrupted we talked for a little bit i asked if he knew a good place to hold our defense meetings he didnt and we found a place what else did he say really where sorry anyway he wanted me to tell you to look in your trunk my trunk asked harry mystified hermione nodded and by her intrigued expression he guessed that sirius had not told her what was waiting in the trunk hermione began to open her mouth in what harry was sure encouragement but he decided to stop the speech before it happened i ll do it now hermione smiled and ginny rolled her eyes as quietly as possible harry opened his trunk and shifted his belongings around when he pushed his winter cloak to the side something hard in the lining caught his attention unfolding it harry found a rectangular object wrapped in brown paper a mirror harry said confused as he sat down next to ginny look on the back there a note contributed hermione a two way mirror those arentallowed ginny shot her a glare but i suppose it would be useful sirius harry said hesitantly his voice lilting the name into a question as he looked into the mirror the glass seemed to swirl into a liquid before clearing as sirius face appeared harry i see hermione relayed the message do you know how many times i ve called your name honestly you re just like james he never unpacked his trunk either sirius said jovially while harry blushed a little in embarrassment i hear you are going to start an illegal defense club sounds great it not illegal protested hermione sirius eyes tried to cut in the direction of her voice just not sanctioned right he guffawed and then moved on either way it is a brilliant idea you wanted to know about hagrid though we haventheard anything since maxime got back she said that he was taking a longer road but nothing else could he have been caught asked ginny with concern no i dontthink so snape would have told us that when sirius said snape name it was with evident disgust how are your occlumency lessons going has he mistreated you at all sirius seemed to almost be looking for an excuse to leave grimmauld place he was his slimy self but not so far sirius face took on an odd angle as he maneuvered himself to look at ginny and raised his eyebrows he telling the truth she answered the silent question unfortunately hermione turned out to be partially right about umbridge reaction after spending a week as a toad umbridge was already in a foul mood but when she had arrived at her first class the suit of armor had stepped out of its alcove and proclaimed in its squeaky rusty voice its undying love for her mood went from foul to something much worse the hallway had veritably exploded with her screams the waiting class however had exploded in laughter to make the scene even more hilarious the suit of armor had waited patiently for umbridge to finish screaming and then had asked for her hand in marriage most of the class which had just recovered from their previous laughing fit fell out of their seats because they started laughing so hard to say that umbridge had not been pleased would have been like calling fred and george innocent harry was now losing points in her class for breathing too loud and not reading fast enough harry had also spent the entire week in detention with filch but he had not been alone while umbridge was obviously hesitant to punish ginny remembering harry words fred and george managed to join harry in detention every night on the bright side of things umbridge had become increasingly paranoid when walking through the corridors it was now routine thing to see her blasting the suits of armor as she walked through the halls by the end of the week filch was constantly complaining under his breath about having to repair and polish the suits they woke saturday morning to educational decree number 24 it forbade the charming of all decorative artwork furniture or other structures in hogwarts by students most found the decree amusing and fred and george were heard loudly vocalizing that it did not forbid the charming of functional materials like chairs desks torches or doors now that fred and george were no longer developing the toad powder they had returned their attention back to their joke shop flyers were posted throughout the gryffindor common room despite hermione attempts to control them a confrontation between the prefect and the two pranksters was looming the hogsmeade weekend would have been a welcomed break from the castle and umbridge except for the fact that hermione had scheduled for everyone to meet at the hogshead to discuss the defense group harry could not believe how many people had turned up or that in the end they had agreed to be taught by him they must all be crazy he communicated to ginny while lying in bed maybe but if you really think about it it not a bad idea you do have more experience than anyone else and we all need to learn defense for our o w l s anyway but i dontknow how to teach protested harry dontworry ron and hermione will help and if anyone knows how to teach it will be hermione speaking of which what is she always dragging you off to talk about ginny tone changed immediately to one of irritation and annoyance donttell her i told you but well it her fault anyway she said she d figure it out and then i wouldnthave to keep secrets from you she having love issues or so i ve termed them what harry asked dumbfounded she been writing to krum and he been saying all the right things but she also likes ron but ron being ron supplied harry understanding ginny giggled yes she keeps asking me how does she know if she in love and what it feels like and blah blah blah so that is what she was getting at she asked me too admitted harry he had forgotten all about it i know and you just had to send her my way i mean how am i supposed to help her decide it not like i ve ever had too oh harry said as an irrational feeling of guilt took hold or wanted to i think she just intimidated by something that does not involve books this time harry was the one to laugh she does realize that she going to have to be the one to make the move on ron right oh please i think hermione is almost as thick as ron she knows he was jealous of krum but for some reason she cantseem to put that together with the idea that ron likes her ginny said disgusted so what are you going to do asked harry very glad he did not have to talk to hermione i going to sit here and listen and listen and listen and listen and then i going to tell her it her decision she just needs time to work it all out i suppose but i still betting on them going straight from arguing to snogging ginny giggled again at the image we ll see now go to bed you have to deal with snape tomorrow night harry woke to a cacophony of yells coming from the common room dragging himself out of bed and into the common room harry found everyone crowded around the billboard hey what going on came ron sleepy voice he bumped into harry who was standing at the foot of the stairs sorry mate they looked at each other confused and were joined by a sleepy ginny the three observed the throng whose words were steadily becoming clearer do you think she ll allow the gobstone club to reform what about the chess club someone else shouted who cares about those what about quidditch came angelina voice the common room went quiet umbridge is including it in the clubs and student organizations no one had an opportunity to question her further as she quickly left the through the portrait hole probably to ask umbridge if they could reform the team hermione found her way out of the throng i donthave to tell you that we are the aim of this do i she handed them the educational decree harry and ginny shook their heads ron however was still staring in shock at where angelina had been she banned quidditch was the only thing they got out of him for the next hour the day was not conducive to helping harry clear his mind of all emotion he spent most of the day ensuring that everyone knew the defense meeting was still on for wednesday as if that was not enough angelina had angrily announced that umbridge was not allowing the gryffindor quidditch team to reform despite the fact that she had allowed the slytherin team to reform so it was with trepidation that he made his way to snape office he guessed that he would spend most of his time behind ginny presence in his mind he just hoped that snape would mistake it for true occlumency potter you re early shut the door said snape the moment harry entered the office he closed the door softly as he turned around he noticed a bowl that looked to be made out of stone the liquid inside of it was silvery in color his eyes glanced up to snape who furtively lowered his wand from his temple harry wondered what he had been doing snape had a look of pure disgust on his face as he examined harry without so much as a warning he raised his wand and said legilimens harry did not even try to shield his mind but retreated snape sneer intensified as he put more effort into the spell he did say i could use my wand protego cried harry immediately harry felt like he was being pulled forward he let loose an oof as he felt like he ran into something solid and then passed through images began racing through his mind all of them involved a greasy haired child the child years at hogwarts past through too fast for harry to glean any information from but as he focused they started to slow the man walked into a dusty pub that harry recognized as the hogshead he walked up the stairs and stopped outside the first door faint voices could be heard harry held his breath something about the memory and the man who had to be a younger snape that screamed that this was an important memory dumbledore voice emanated from the closed door thank you ms trelawney but i dontthink a hoarse voice broke him off a voice harry had heard once before the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies hey what do you think you re doing there yelled the bartender get out of here right now the memory began to shift again but harry was suddenly thrown back snape had cursed him you will stay out of my head potter from snape look harry knew two things one the he was not supposed to see that memory and two the professor meant to do him harm he was not quick enough to prevent the professor from saying legilimens the spell hit him with at least double the force as snape first spell but it still was of no use harry wanted to smile but knew that might push the potion professor over the edge he raised his wand and saw snape eyes widen in surprise figuring that the shield charm had worked reasonably well before said protego again the feeling of falling overtook him and he found himself viewing snape memories snape was kneeling in a clearing surrounded by woods wearing the black robes of a death eater but he was missing his mask he gasped as voldemort stepped out of the shadows severus what do you have to report harry watched transfixed as snape repeated what he had overheard in the hogshead voldemort was obviously disturbed by the news yes i see the child must die voldemort paced in front of snape his black robes billowing still pondering the prophecy it has to be the potter boy you have done well harry did not wait for the rest of the memory as he realized what he had seen snape had betrayed dumbledore snape was responsible for his parents deaths panic and several other intense emotions seemed to be trying to overwhelm him gripping his wand tightly he yelled expelliarmus the spell from his already raised wand hit snape in the chest sending the professor flying backwards into the wall wasting no time harry twirled opened the door and flung himself into the hallway slamming the door behind him he could hear snape getting up from the crash of bottles aiming his wand at the door he cried colloportus the door squelched as it sealed harry ran from the office harry meet me at dumbledore office ginny voice cut through his panic he followed it without conscious thought harry skidded to a stop in front of the stone gargoyle only to be plowed over by ginny merlin i sorry harry she panted ginny stood and pulled harry up they locked eyes and immediately embraced tightly harry panic and horror slowly ebbed as ginny held him it all right harry dontworry she whispered into his ear harry hands tightened on her back he the reason was all harry was able to say ginny nodded and softly rubbed his back extracting herself from harry arms ginny turned to the gargoyle she was not in the mood to guess what foolish password dumbledore had chosen move i need to speak to the headmaster now the gargoyle did not move ginny raised her wand to cast a spell when harry grabbed her wand hand there a better way harry said and transformed into a phoenix you should have thought of this chided harry as he wagged his tail feathers at her ginny smiled at harry swift change in attitude it was hard to be negative as a phoenix the first thing harry noticed when he burst into flames in dumbledore office was the object to the far left on the desk it was softly glowing dumbledore was looking at harry and ginny serenely as if having a phoenix enter his office with someone in tow was the most normal thing in the world fawkes looked at him with interest and chirped it is good to see you again harry bobbed his head in agreement and then transformed the illuminated object ceased glowing may i ask what brings you to my office tonight asked dumbledore dumbledore question brought what had happened back and harry pulse began to increase again snape he professor snape harry dumbledore corrected absently both harry and ginny gave him a disgusted look he the reason my parents are dead harry growled dumbledore eyebrows disappeared into his hairline you broke into professor snape mind said dumbledore amazed both harry and ginny colored harry took a step back with a look of horror on his face ginny took a step forward as if shielding harry from dumbledore you knew she yelled the portraits that had been pretending to sleep stopped pretending you knew and you let that that monster teach here what is wrong with you dumbledore eyed the young witch carefully if he did not say the right thing he was likely to get hexed worse if he reached for his wand which he had left on the edge of his desk harry might interpret this as an attempt to attack ginny he was not in any mood to test the limits of harry power tonight ms weasley mr potter please let me explain can you tell me exactly what happened he decided to risk looking into harry eyes behind him fawkes trilled a soft tune that calmed everyone both harry and ginny glanced at fawkes as if confirming something and moved forward to sit down dumbledore sighed and leaned back into the chair as harry finished his tale harry i know what you saw was bad but you must believe me professor snape is not working for lord voldemort when he realized that voldemort was going to attack you and your parents he felt horrible he became a spy for the order and helped keep your parents from voldemort grasp for several months before you went under the fidelious charm snape hated my father he would not have cared if he died harry insisted not willing to believe dumbledore true he did not have fond feelings for your father but he did owe him a life debt and that is powerful magic that doesnt matter retorted harry dumbledore had told him that life debts were powerful magic but he no longer believed not after wormtail had nearly caused his death in the tri wizard tournament you must trust me harry professor snape is not a death eater harry and ginny only stared at him dumbledore did not have to use his legilimency to know that neither believed him so you heard the prophecy he said changing the topic yes harry responded flatly it doesnthave to be harry interjected ginny dumbledore nodded that was true was said harry with a note of fear ginny wordlessly interlaced her hand with his what professor snape heard and then relayed to voldemort was only a fragment of the full prophecy the full prophecy leaves little doubt dumbledore said carefully there is a copy of this prophecy in the department of mysteries that is what the order has been guarding exclaimed ginny dumbledore nodded yes harry face hardened at his words as he seemed to realize something why didntyou tell me i could have been preparing training and the teenager could not find anymore words and gaped at dumbledore dumbledore seemed to fold in on himself i made a mistake a mistake of old age his eyes met harry sadly i did not want to burden with it i wanted to give you more time to enjoy your childhood ginny snorted at this but said nothing though she did glare at the old man i kept telling myself you were too young and that it could not hurt to wait one more year he waited for more questions from the pair but they appeared to be in shock i know you have questions and i do have a lot to tell you but it would be better if you heard the full prophecy first i will arrange for us to go to the ministry during the break if that is all right with you harry nodded and the couple quietly stood and left his office his eyes followed them until the door closed knowing that he would not be able to hold anything back from them once he told them the truth ginny in particular was not going to allow harry to be manipulated he could have shown harry the prophecy in the pensive but there were still too many questions dumbledore frown deepened as he thought of the changed prophecy prophecies did not change of course he thought neither do a ten and an eleven year old bond another thought quickly followed it cantbe that simple dumbledore looked at the door again as he considered the possibility but how it should not be possible none of this should be possible not for the first time dumbledore felt frustration prophecies are set they can be ignored and sometimes even circumvented but not changed the only way would be no no one would do that it too dangerous not even voldemort would dare but would harry mused dumbledore as he felt goosebumps form on his skin he needed to have a long talk with harry and ginny about how they became bonded heaving a great sigh dumbledore decided that he would tell harry everything the first day of the break the resulting discussion was going to take more than an evening and he did not want to have it anywhere near dolores umbridge chuckling dumbledore realized that one of his other professors might need some help since harry had told him that he had cursed the professor dumbledore had expected snape to come storming in demanding harry expulsion of course that assumed snape was able to break the sealing charm harry had placed on the door a n here chapter 17 it was very hard to write nasty case of writers block anyhow thanks for all the great reviews i ll be posting review responses at hmmm check my profile it doesntlike html in the document give me 24 48 hours to get those up though i ve got quite a bit of work to do over the next couple of days disclaimer i dontown harry potter everyone knows that 17 phoenix lesson harry did not recall how he made it back to the common room and up to his bed the previous night ginny must have guided him to bed taking a deep breath harry realized that he could still smell her his movement caused something red to shift from the pillow to his chest it was ginny she had not left him you all right came ginny sleepy voice harry pulled her a little closer yeah it just a lot to take in at once i always knew snape was an evil slimeball but but he the reason i donthave any parents him and wormtail then there the prophecy this time it was ginny who gripped him tighter it doesntmatter the sleepiness had left her voice it a prophecy it is going to happen protested harry it has not told us anything we didntalready know everyone knows you have the power to defeat him you did it when you a baby and after last year it is not exactly a secret that he wants you dead i guess but i dontlike the idea that my fate is sealed there was a long pause from ginny as she considered his words your fate is not sealed it did not say anything about you dying quit worrying about it we haventeven heard the whole thing yet besides you ve got other things to think about i do harry began to contemplate several ways to kill snape not that although drowning him in his own cauldron does have promise ginny said distractedly before getting back to the point the defense group is meeting tomorrow night by the way it needs a better name harry frowned the year was not turning out well and and yes and we need to help ron with his transformation harry looked around the common room in frustration and a little bit of fear almost every gryffindor in fourth year and above was waiting for him to take them to where the defense meeting was going to be held hermione was beaming at the large crowd harry resisted the urge to throttle her besides he knew he was not really mad at her he was mad at snape it had taken all of his self control not to hex snape in class the thing that had really saved him from hexing snape was not his self control though it was umbridge presence seeing his two most hated professors having a silent battle of wills was even better than seeing mcgonagall blowing up at umbridge he had no hope that she would put snape on probation like ron had told him she had with trelawney but he still was able to fantasize about what life would be like with a different potions professor er can everyone harry stopped as he realized he had almost said can everyone hear me and he did not want to quote that hack can everyone follow me everyone nodded or said a quiet affirmative harry stood for a few seconds before he realized everyone was waiting for him to lead them shaking his head in astonishment harry led them out of the common room and toward the room of requirement where he would meet ginny ginny was currently meeting with those from other houses in the library so that she could lead them to the seventh floor no one spoke when the entered the room of requirement only harry and ginny had ever seen it before and neither of them had seen it setup like a training room on one side of the wall were shelves of books dedicated to hexes jinxes and curses the other three walls were lined with what looked like padding of some kind pillows were piled in one of the corners as well harry was sure they would be useful for practicing stunning almost everyone from the hogshead had shown up even the annoying zacharias smith harry eyes surveyed the rest of the gathered group in addition to the gryffindors the other houses seemed to be well represented susan bones hannah abbot and ernie macmillian from hufflepuf were present ravenclaw had even more which did not really surprise harry as the defense association was a way to further knowledge what did surprise him was the cho chang had shown she was standing near a boy harry only vaguely recognized he was certain that the boy had said who he was at the hogshead but he did not remember harry smiled at their proximity hey ginny i dont think cho interested in me any more good i guess everyone is here hey this is fantastic announced george but i thought it was a broom closet didntwe hide here from filch once inquired fred harry grinned at the twins and just as he opened his mouth the door opened again luna lovegood wandered in she looked around and grinned dreamily before moving to stand beween ron and neville both boys gave luna nervous glances as if gauging to see if she was going to say anything strange but she did not ginny gave him a mental prod er well i guess harry began but hermione interrupted excuse me but i think we should all remember that we agreed to keep what we are doing here secret this means you canttell anyone outside the group except for those who might be interested in joining we all signed on it ginny gave hermione a piercing look there was something in hermione voice and the way she had said signed that made her think that hermione was hiding something important we need a name came a dreamy voice luna was smiling absently and everyone began nodding in agreement as if in shock that they agreed with something luna had said it needs to be something we can say without arousing suspicion contributed hermione i know the ministry of magic are morons group announced fred to chuckles no something that wontarouse suspicion hermione hissed and fred mumbled something about it being a joke it won t we can call it the mmmg announced george to laughter how about the defense association asked cho seriously and the d a just for short no one will know what were talking about that sounds good seconded ginny who briefly toyed with the idea of suggesting dumbledore army but decided that no matter how much she wanted to spite umbridge and the ministry in general she also did not want to be dumbledore army excellent let vote on it then said hermione raise your hands to vote yes she commanded almost every hand went up that settles it welcomed to the d a now we need a leader several people shifted and looked at each other and then back at hermione finally someone in the back spoke up i thought harry was the leader hermione smiled like an indulgent teacher yes but i think we should make it official it would give him more authority so all in favor everyone raised their hands even zacharias smith though he did so with a reluctant air although incredibly nervous and unsure of himself harry knew he was expected to start ok i guess we should start with something simple like the disarming spell the incantation is expelliarmus now if you would pair off and in incredulous snort came from zacharias smith oh please if we are just going to go over simple stuff what the point the disarming charm can be very useful responded ginny with an icy tone smith evidently missed the tone because he just rolled his eyes how is it going to be useful against you know who ginny responded cuttingly how do you expect to face him at all if you cant even say his name zacharias smith glared at her knowing that if this kept up ginny would be demonstrating a few unique hexes on an unwilling test subject harry decided to act and ginny is right he placed his hands on her shoulders the charm is very useful i ve used it against him and it saved my life oh said smith coloring slightly i guess it wouldnthurt to practice it quickly became clear that despite the simplicity of the spell many people needed practice getting their strength and accuracy under control ginny had paired with zacaharias smith after she had sent him flying across the room for the fifth time he found someone else to practice with enjoying yourself ginny flashed him a brilliant smile as she moved to pair off with someone else harry continued to walk around giving helpful pointers and occasionally demonstrating the proper wand movement oww came a loud groan that could only be ron after he and hermione had gotten into a small argument relative to their previous arguments over proper wand movement he had paired with luna and hermione with neville harry had not really been watching but from what little he had seen he could not figure out how ron had ended on the wall opposite luna she had been erratic for sure sometimes her charm did nothing more than tickle but her spell even when it worked had not send anyone sailing before luna was kneeling besides ron by the time harry arrived at the side of the room everyone had gathered around the groaning gryffindor what happened ron only groaned again and luna turned her head to face harry he said i was not doing the spell right there was only a trace of concern on her face er well it looks like you ve got it right to me harry said ginny snorted boy ron you must be a great teacher ron gave her a dark look he is a wonderful teacher said luna her concerned face was gone replaced by her standard dreamy look ginny giggled look at hermione the older girl was frowning as her eyes went from luna to ron and back to luna harry was not sure if she was irritated that ron had obviously been able to teach someone the correct wand movements or that luna was flirting with him in her own strange manner his question was answered when hermione frown deepened and a line formed on her forehead luna had pulled ron up and was brushing him off ronald you need to be more careful when you fall you almost hit the baby blibbering humdingers luna hands lingered slightly longer than necessary as she brushed his shoulders and back ron did not look like he knew how to handle the attention yeah um sorry thanks luna the next two weeks went by rapidly harry was so busy even with ginny help with homework quidditch and the d a that he did not have much time to dwell on either the prophecy or snape unfortunately the time he did have to brood was spent brooding over ron he had not been doing well at the quidditch practices and as the game between slytherin and gryffindor drew closer it seemed the slytherins were getting to him with their needling harry and ginny had discussed the issue at length and neither of them had a solution angelina refused to give up on ron though for which harry was thankful harry had even gone to sirius for advice but the old marauder did not have any helpful suggestions just saying that it was something ron had to work through truthfully harry was becoming more and more worried about ron quidditch was not the only area where ron was having trouble ginny and harry had been trying to work with him on his animagus transformation but he was not making any progress then there was umbridge while harry and ginny did not prank umbridge other than occasionally renewing a charm on a suit of arms she had not spent the past two weeks in peace fred and george seemed to take over their role while they were busy they took great glee in following umbridge decrees to the letter umbridge had not realized her mistake when she had prohibited the charming of decorative objects she had entered class one day to find that all the desks had been charmed to act as cattle it had taken a plea to both professor flitwick and professor dumbledore and half the day waiting for them to respond before the charm was removed next the twins targeted her meals she had run screaming from the hall when the knives all the knives had suddenly stood on their ends and started flying at her when the knives finally caught up with her they had stopped only a couple centimeters from her before harmlessly falling to the floor harry favorite had been a tie between when the twins had somehow charmed the cushion of her chair to bite and when they transfigured the stupid bow on top of her head into a fly several educational decrees followed the twin spate of pranks all of them very specific in what should not be charmed so far the list included besides decorative objects desks chairs silverware quills inkwells tables and professor clothes harry hand clenched hard around the snitch he was happy that the game was over ron performance had been dismal he had not saved even a single shot then there were the slytherins with their equally awful song between the song and crabbe and goyle blatant fouling which crabbe was being told off for now by madam hooch it was a wonder they had won at all harry shook his head as he was joined by fred and george unfortunately fred and george were not the only ones to join him on the ground malfoy drawl came from behind him hey potter i heard you stayed with those weasels harry rolled his eyes and did not even both to turn around the fact that fred and george were weasels made the statement rather funny to him fred and george both grinned i dontknow how you stand it they live in a converted pigsty i understand the smell has to be awful and then there their pudgy foul smelling blood traitor of a mother it was not harry but fred and george who reacted harry caught george who was closest to him and held him back the gryffindor chasers had joined them at some point and it was taking all three of them to hold fred away from malfoy malfoy glee at their reactions was evident in his voice oh my but that did hit a nerve what about you potter dontyou care i suppose you wouldntso long as you still get to do their sister harry felt his face color in anger but still refused to face malfoy taunts is she any good perhaps i ll find out malfoy voice dropped so few could hear him there are a lot of dark hallways the next thing harry knew his fist had impacted malfoy surprised face the force of the impact sent malfoy a good ten feet george was rushing to join him he had just thrown his first punch when something impacted them both forcing them to fall away from malfoy mr potter why i never in all my years at hogwarts how dare you hit another student madam hooch had evidently finished with crabbe follow me both of you came the stern voice of professor mcgonagall harry and george gave malfoy looks of sheer hate before turning to follow mcgonagall the slight glow around harry hand faded harry allowed himself a brief smile as malfoy was cursed with the bat bogey hex when the reached her office she commanded them to take the seats opposite her desk muggle dueling what got into you two you should be ashamed of yourselves hem hem harry was not sure if it was him or george that groaned hogwarts high inquisitor dolores umbridge had arrived the common room was in an uproar no one was sure except for ginny what had happened to cause the fight ginny was ignoring the entire affair in favor of pacing in front of the portrait hole eventually hermione had ordered everyone to go to bed despite her attempts fred and ginny remained ginny was still pacing but now it was mostly due to anger umbridge is going to spend some quality time as a toad she vowed and then added in the owlery sounds good came harry disgruntled reply the portrait slammed shut as harry and george trudged through george was the first to speak umbridge banned us his gaze shifted to fred you too silence greeted the statement and then fred and george left for the dormitory without a word mcgonagall wouldn t hermione said lamely umbridge would growled harry in reply hermione nodded in understanding ron chose that moment to walk through the portrait hole his red hair plastered to his forehead he had obviously spent a long time in the showers hey guys he said dismally i going to tell angelina i quit in the morning thanks for saving my butt tonight harry you cantquit harry said with equal depression what he along with fred and george has been banned by umbridge if you quit then she will have to replace more than half the team ginny supplied ron looked up and through the nearest window as if trying to find his courage oh i guess i have to stay th a surprised look crossed his face the lights are on in hagrid hut i ll get the invisibility cloak harry said as he surveyed three eager faces quidditch troubles momentarily forgotten there was no way for all four of them to fit under the invisibility cloak harry looked around furtively before transforming grabbing ginny and flaming to the back of hagrid hut hermione and ron were left with the invisibility cloak harry and ginny waited for them by hagrid door it was easily apparent when the pair was near ginny said harry loudly can you tell me the point of using an invisibility cloak if you are only going to give away your position by arguing giggling before responding ginny also answered in a clear voice only if you are ron and hermione the bickering ceased immediately what do you mean asked ron indignantly as he took the invisibility cloak off what do you think they mean responded a flushed hermione ron opened his mouth to respond when hagrid door opened should have known it was you always breakin the rules i could hear you bickering from a mile away come inside come inside said hagrid with a gruff smile the four of them quickly entered the cabin grateful for the warmth provided by the fire where have you been demanded hermione before anyone had a chance to speak hagrid back was back to them and he did not respond either because he did not hear hermione or because he did not want to the four of them gasped as hagrid turned allowing them their first good look at him his face was bruised and sported several nasty cuts hagrid what happened hermione tone had changed from accusatory to conciliatory it looks worse than it is don you worry about it i wan ta hear what been happening her hagrid said trying to brush her off it did not work he was forced to tell them what he had been doing during the summer although none of them were happy with his explanation of why he was late he just said that he had taken a longer road home now tell me what i ve missed i haven had any news since i lef hagrid demanded smiling they looked at each other not sure where to start harry figured he might as well start with the worst well umbridge is teaching defense against the dark arts she the hogwarts high inquisitor i ve been banned from playing quidditch oh and umbridge is inspecting teachers hagrid face was confused or at least they part they could see under the piece of dragon meat what high inquisitor umbridge as in dolores umbridge hagrid asked hermione again came to the rescue giving an excellent rendition of everything that had happened since they had come back to school so you see why you have to be careful with your lessons trelawney is already on probation and we already know that umbridge has a grudge against half breeds and anyone who supports dumbledore don worry i ve go somin special planned hagrid assured he going to get fired ginny sent yep hermione obviously thought the same thing no i mean just stick to professor grubbly plank syllabus and teach whatever is going to be on our o w l s hagrid smiled why would you wan that i ve got somin interestin planned that what i afraid of muttered hermione quietly surely there something else you can do none of that i ve been plannin this since last year i ve probably got the only domesticated herd in all of britain hagrid proclaimed happily now tell me about your summer hermione again took over the story but she had not got far when hagrid interrupted whoa harry ginny you are both animagi hagrid gleeful face told everyone he thought there was nothing wrong with them becoming animagi or that harry had not been staying with the dursleys hermione seemed a little putout but did not say anything well what are you waitin for show me harry smiled at ginny and the both transformed harry into a phoenix and ginny into a panther harry also a panther said ron happily even hermione seemed to be ready to accept the situation it is remarkable i dont recall ever reading about an animagus with two forms let see the phoenix again hagrid prodded harry panther form and then he turned his attention back to ginny what a sweet kitty you make both hermione and ron rolled their eyes ginny did not look like a sweet kitty to them hagrid looked up from examining ginny sharp teeth and inhaled sharply who that hermione quickly went to the window umbridge quick we need to hide there was not time for harry or ginny to rush towards ron and hermione who had thrown the invisibility cloak over themselves not knowing what else to do they remained in their animagus forms hello hagrid said as he opened the door umbridge smiled and entered the cabin without invitation harry noticed that she was walking gingerly and her hand would often caress her backside i wonder what fred and george charmed to bite her this time ginny amusement was evident oh the possibilities are endless snickered harry her nose crinkled in disgust as she looked around when she saw the panther and the phoenix she widened her eyes in surprise well you must be professor hagrid i hogwarts high inquisitor dolores umbridge she did not extend her hand as you may or may not be aware i am charged with ensuring the education received by the students here at hogwarts is up to ministry standards to that end i am inspecting every professor so you can expect to see me soon her eyes flicked to the panther which growled at her and then to the phoenix her curiosity got the better of her i was under the impression that you only owned a dog hagrid looked toward the two transformed students er yes you see the panther er i found in the forest she was um injured umbridge raised an eyebrow yes see that it remains under control ginny growled louder and umbridge took a half step back and the phoenix how did you come to own one a look of relief past over hagrid face the large man was not a good liar but the toad like woman had unwittingly given him a way out she had asked him about a magical creature and hagrid knowledge on the topic was probably only second to dumbledore s i don own the phoenix no one can own a phoenix not even dumbledore owns fawkes really how interesting she lied badly why is it here hagrid looked lost well um er he s ah agreed to help in my next lesson yeah that right my next lesson harry chirped in encouragement umbridge frowned unable to find fault with the answer term started on september 1st where have you been i was um coming back from my vacation hagrid stumbled over his words really hmmm i will be taking that into account in your final evaluation umbridge turned to leave but stopped and said you would not happen to know where the footsteps leading to your cabin came from do you ginny growled deeply and shifted her weight umbridge noticed oh yes well if you dontmind i will be leaving she left quickly that a brilliant idea hagrid crowed hermione hagrid and the others looked at her bewildered you said that you were going to teach phoenixes next lesson i bet umbridge is going to inspect on your first class back it would be so like her hagrid looked doubtful but did not know how to get himself out of it harry however saw promise in hermione plan it a good idea hagrid all i have to do is pretend to be sick and she wontbe able to find anything wrong with you teaching about phoenixes hagrid still looked troubled i don know phoenixes aren very excitin ah how could we forget if it does not have razor sharp teeth or claws and could kill you as quick as it could blink it isntinteresting giggled ginny mentally but hagrid you could make anything interesting besides ginny stopped as she realized what she was about to say and shuddered and besides harry said taking over from ginny as he moved to her side phoenixes are interesting just look at what fawkes was able to accomplish in my second year hmmm yes that was impressive the way he blinded the basilisk hagrid mused hagrid was one of the few people who knew almost the entire story and it had surprised everyone considering his fascination with dangerous beasts that he had described the basilisk as a horrible creature phoenixes are mighty powerful magical creatures hagrid seemed to be talking to himself repositioning the steak on his face he looked at harry so can you travel by fire i ve seen fawkes do that many times yes it much better than flooing or portkey harry answered with a grin do you have all the other phoenix powers hagrid interest in creatures of all kinds seemed to be getting the best of him harry crinkled his forehead in thought i can carry heavy loads and well besides that it is the only thing i ve done besides flame travel you haven used healin tears asked hagrid with interest evident on the half of his face that was visible hey harry you could heal him interjected ron i suppose i could try go ahead harry urged hermione harry transformed into a phoenix and flew to perch on the arm of hagrid chair hagrid removed the green the steak so harry had access to the rest of his injured face blinking rapidly harry tried to summon tears it did not work he tried remembering every sad and traumatic thing that had ever happened to him but still the tears would not come for five minutes he continued his attempts to cry but to no avail finally he gave a frustrated trill he almost fell off his perch in shock light seemed to shine out of hagrid wounds and a great sadness overtook him as he examined the escaping light a single pearly tear fell from his right eye onto hagrid face it was soon followed by another and another they refused to stop until hagrid wounds were healed when the last of hagrid wounds closed harry felt a great sense of accomplishment and he gave another trill by instinct and he found himself searching hagrid for any escaping white light merlin harry that was amazing yeah harry was still in a shocked state from the experience thanks harry that was amazin interrupted hagrid great work mate thought you werentgoing to be able to do it for a moment there said ron harry transformed back into himself i couldntat first but then i gave that short burst of song and something happened both hermione and hagrid eagerly leaned in i saw this light white i think emanating from your wounds and then tears started to fall hagrid ran his hand thoughtfully through his beard but did not say anything hermione however was eager to start hypothesizing that astounding i wonder if it has anything to do with the phoenix song being able to instill courage or fear hagrid nodded in agreement perhaps but i think you four better get back to the castle he cast a furtive eye to the bed been a long journey and i needin some rest and sleep hermione and ron once again hid under the invisibility cloak while harry flamed both ginny and himself he was sure hagrid enjoyed seeing him flame pushing all of his books into his bag harry made to leave transfiguration for lunch mr potter a word called mcgonagall from the front of the room harry motioned for ginny and the others to leave he could catch up to them at lunch i understand you are feeling under the weather harry gave her a perplexed look mcgonagall stern look faltered an affliction that is going to hit you quite suddenly just before your care of magical creatures class harry eyes widened in realization and he was about to explain when mcgonagall cut him off it will not be necessary immediately after lunch you are to report to the headmaster office for the duration of class he has something he wishes to discuss with you thanks professor said harry and mcgonagall gave him a curt smile soon after lunch harry found himself in dumbledore office this is a very good thing you are doing harry harry jumped slightly at the headmaster unexpected voice i think you need to be somewhere else harry flamed above the forbidden forest and made a few large circles as he waited for the class to arrive he reveled in the simple freedom of flying it was even better as a phoenix than with a broom in case you havent noticed we re waiting came ginny amused voice harry began a leisurely dive below the class had gathered around hagrid ginny decided that now would be the best time to inform hagrid of the change of plan just in case umbridge questioned harry absence professor hagrid professor mcgonagall wanted me to tell you that harry is in a meeting with dumbledore oh okay gather round class gather round hagrid said waving his large arms i ve got a special treat for ya today hagrid looked up expectantly and harry steeped his dive startling most of the class with his arrival ginny grinned wickedly professor is this the phoenix ruffles you were telling us about she sincerely hoped hagrid would pick up the name the phoenix turned to glare at her was that necessary i could have let hagrid name you yeah well he named fang fang he probably would have named me something vicious and manly you re forgetting that he thinks that phoenixes are interesting remember norbert and fluffy yeah your right he might have named me something like ruffles oh quit mopping unaware of the mental conversation hagrid was continuing with his lesson er yes that right this is ruffles phoenixes are powerfully magical creatures now who can tell me their powers to now one surprise hermione hand was the first into the air several other people also raised their hands neville name one power said hagrid pleased at the many hands hem hem ah professor hagrid why did you not wait for my arrival i sent you a note telling you i would be inspecting today said umbridge silkily harry glared at her as much as a phoenix can glare i can start me class late professor answered hagrid well neville now that it came time to answer neville looked nervous umm i heard phoenixes can travel by fire that right five points to gryffindor hagrid gave harry a look he took off into the sky and flamed to hagrid hut still in view of the students before flaming back near them and perching on hagrid large shoulder the class made appreciative noises of oohs and aahs who next how about you hagrid pointed at pavarti well sir phoenixes can also carry very heavy loads she answered clearly another five points how about someone from slytherin said hagrid trying not to be biased their tears have healing powers came a voice from the back very good mr zibini five points to slytherin anything else at his point umbridge interrupted how long have you been teaching here er it only me third year teachin hagrid said clearly losing his train of thought from the interruption oh really he cast umbridge a glance as she began mingling among the students um yes er can anyone think of any other powers phoenixes have hermione hand was the only one up this time hermione hagrid called their song gives courage and hope to the pure of heart while those who are impure will quail from it she answered giving him the textbook response another five points to gryffindor said hagrid trying to ignore umbridge hurtful questions to the students harry decided to give a trill to help him hagrid did perk up as did many of the gryffindors and even a few of the slytherins what surprised harry were those who flinched while malfoy and most of the slytherins flinching did not surprise him both dean and seamus flinched as well he did not get to see if umbridge had flinched not that he needed to see but when she began asking malfoy about buckbeak attack harry gave another loud trill he ruffled his feathers proudly as malfoy and umbridge flinched but felt his elation disappear as he caught both seamus and dean flinching again his concentration was interrupted by a burst of flames high in the sky a crimson and gold phoenix was now sailing downward towards him fawkes chirped above the class hello young one it is good to see you again it is a pity you no longer fly as much i have missed our lessons i ve been afraid that professor dumbledore fawkes gave a trill that could only be a laugh yes my human is keeping a close watch on you with that glowing ball of his but i insist that you and your mate come fly with me soon if i am away at the same time he will not worry harry was not sure how to answer flying with fawkes was always fun and almost always a learning experience at the same time he did not want to alert dumbledore that ginny was a phoenix too he saw little option but to be honest with the phoenix i dontwant him to know ginny is a phoenix too the chirp he gave was decidedly sullen do you believe he does not already suspect replied fawkes enigmatically harry blinked you can trust him he is not always right but his heart is in the right place fawkes settled down on the paddock highest railing and gave him a piercing look albus has lived alone for too long with the full weight of the world in his care i fear that you may soon understand but do not judge him too harshly remember that you will bear his burden one day but you will have your mate he cares a lot for you fawkes finished harry fidgeted from foot to foot on hagrid shoulder both he and ginny had been listening intently fawkes rarely spoke for so long the class had been paying close attention to the chirps and trills they had been exchanging seeing one phoenix was a rare thing but seeing two was unheard of harry gave a trill of understanding and thanks again he saw dean and seamus flinch why do they flinch fawkes looked over the class and gave a long trill many of the slytherins flinched and harry noticed that this time neither seamus nor dean flinched he cocked his head quizzically at fawkes remember you are a phoenix but you are also human harry considered the statement you mean they re reacting to me fawkes gave an affirming chirp i can understand why seamus might we still arenttalking but why dean human emotions are complex and there are many besides ill intent which could make your song unpleasant to them fawkes explained as he preened hagrid was busy showing off the two phoenixes what harry asked confused i think fawkes means things like envy jealousy or some other personal reason ginny sent while trying to pretend she was paying attention to hagrid lecture your mate is correct said fawkes harry almost fell of hagrid shoulder in shock and gave a surprised caw that sounded very un phoenix like with a flap of his wings he relocated to the paddock railing how fawkes cocked his head to the side and stared hard at harry as if judging him we are phoenix fawkes did not say another word but sailed into the air and harry knew that he was supposed to follow you can hear us your thoughts must be focused to me what we share is different from the bond with your mate why didntyou say anything before asked harry he was slightly uncomfortable with having another voice in his head all creatures have secrets some more than others and many are not for humans it was left unsaid that fawkes expected harry and ginny to keep it a secret there more to this isntthere fawkes tone held a bit of amusement there is always more harry followed fawkes through a few dives and fast turns before deciding to return to hagrid class he arrived just in time to hear umbridge ask where he was and ginny inform her that he was with professor dumbledore albus dumbledore looked across the desk at his two most remarkable students they also happened to be his most worrisome the past couple weeks had been very eventful professor umbridge had spent almost the entire time as a toad he could only assume it was in response to harry and the twins quidditch ban mr potter mrs potter he began he hoped that by using mrs potter he was conveying both the seriousness of the situation and ensuring that ginny remained calm she was not going to like him taking away her fun i have received disturbing news he watched them unconsciously move closer together that the ministry is going to try to put you on trial harry we will probably hear something about it shortly before or just after the end of term but i do not want you to worry about this their charges should be easy to refute however i do not believe it would be wise for anything untold to happen to professor umbridge between now and then though she does make for a rather fetching toad dumbledore allowed himself a small smile he was going to have to invest in the twin joke shop when it opened you both must watch each other actions carefully you are being watched closely they both nodded their understanding very good are you sure you would not care for a lemon drop no they really are quite good i ve been addicted for well dumbledore cleared his throat as he realized that he had gone off on a tangent there is one more thing i wanted to ask you it is about voldemort the two students stiffened what is it asked harry with a tone of worry have you been having any more dreams dumbledore could not think of an easier way to ask harry fidgeted and looked down ginny answered he still dreams about the department of mysteries every once in awhile dumbledore nodded it was to be expected harry mumbled something what was that harry my ears are not as good as they used to be looking up harry breathed in deeply i think he getting frustrated dumbledore sent him a questioning look the dreams when i have them are more intense and the more i think about the more i think its frustration i didntreally notice until you asked he trailed off unsure of what else to say quite alright are you sure you would not care for a lemon drop asked dumbledore the question lightened the mood no thank you professor they both chorused you may go please remember to be careful and do not antagonize professor umbridge dumbledore beard shifted it will not be for too long i expect everything to be cleared up by the end of the holidays once harry and ginny had left dumbledore unfolded the letter and read it again yes things will be cleared up one way or another fudge was becoming increasingly troublesome and umbridge presence at the school was only making matters more difficult for dumbledore he was thankful for the letter warning he was also positive he had seen the neat and precise handwriting before severus was also providing some disturbing news that confirmed what harry had told him an unspeakable had been put under the imperius curse bode if he remembered correctly voldemort had sent him to try and retrieve the prophecy in many ways it was a relief voldemort still did not know that only he and harry could retrieve it from the self he was also becoming increasingly eager to begin testing his hypothesis about why voldemort did not die when the killing curse rebounded dumbledore was trying to figure out a way to leave hogwarts without arousing suspicion he could not confirm his hypothesis if he was here he had suspected since that halloween night that voldemort had split his soul however the appearance of riddle diary had forced him to consider ideas that should have been impossible the study of horcruxes was extremely dark and as far as dumbledore knew no one had ever succeeded in splitting their soul more than once tom riddle evidently had found a way dumbledore doubted riddle knowledge of horcruxes was more extensive than his own few had access to those books and there were precious few alive who knew anything more than myths of course riddle had found valid information on how to perform the ceremony dumbledore shuddered riddle had not only split his soul in half but had done so several times evidently none of the literature said that it could not be done indeed not one even mentioned it it would take an evil and twisted mind to even think of it he shook his head in amazement even among those who immersed themselves in the dark arts few were willing to split their souls in their quests for immortality splitting the soul transformed it into something less than human hagrid had been right there was not enough human left in voldemort to die again dumbledore wondered how many times riddle had split his soul most had not even believed it was possible for the soul to be split more than once but it appeared that when tom riddle or harry potter for that matter was involved the impossible became possible behind him fawkes gave a reassuring and uplifting trill dumbledore turned around and softly stroked the phoenix head ever since hagrid phoenix lesson the orb on his desk had softly glowed blue every weekend each time fawkes had been missing as well so he had not been worried that harry had left the safety of hogwarts he eyed the phoenix sometimes he thought that the bird knew more about was going on than anyone else he was sure now that the phoenix knew that harry had been an animagus long before anyone had suspected truth be told dumbledore was extremely happy harry had become one especially his phoenix form it provided an easy and almost unstoppable avenue of escape the panther form was also very formidable it certainly reflects ginny personality mused dumbledore the fact that harry was also a panther made him wonder it would make sense for ginny to be a phoenix too it would explain why harry had two forms the qualities of the phoenix fit harry just as well as the panther did ginny dumbledore imagined that the bond must have made two animagus forms possible never had it been recorded before but then a bonded pair had never become animagi after they had become bonded harry and ginny quietly made their way back to the common room he looked older harry sent for the first time it really hit him that dumbledore was an old man he did i think he worried about something that doesnt narrow things down harry looked around you know we dont have to go back so soon ginny stopped walking and turned to face him she leaned her back and cocked her head oh we don t and what else do you have in mind harry looked down into her mischievously glinting eyes and was about to suggest they duck into the nearest alcove but the soft patter of feat distracted him mrs norris i ve got an idea harry changed into a panther followed shortly by ginny and they were racing after a thoroughly terrified cat twenty minutes later they were walking through the portrait hole i must say harry that when you said we did not have to come back immediately i thought you were suggesting something a tad bit more provocative harry blushed and ginny gave a small laugh they both knew exactly what he had been thinking it amused ginny to no end that harry blushed even though he knew that she was more than a willing partner but i must say you do know how to show a girl a good time they collapsed on the nearest couch harry looked at the stairs with a little trepidation dreams were not really bothering him but going to sleep would mean tomorrow would only come quicker despite their near constant pranking of umbridge this year was turning out to be harry worst year at hogwarts umbridge was trying quite effectively to make his life miserable her most notable achievement was his quidditch ban hermione had tried to cheer him up by telling him it would give him more time to study for o w l s but he missed quidditch ginny had joined the team and taken his spot as seeker between her natural talent flying at the manor and her firebolt she was very good despite this she was constantly complaining about how it would be far more interesting to be a chaser she said that seeking was boring unfortunately the two new beaters were nowhere near as good as fred and george had been to make matters even worse ron was still playing dismally at practice beyond quidditch there was snape snape response to their confrontation was to studiously ignore harry harry would have found his behavior a breath of fresh air but every time he looked at the greasy haired professor he remembered what he had seen in snape mind it made potions even longer than the classes already were the only thing that was giving him any joy was the d a he enjoyed the teaching especially since it was something umbridge and ministry obviously did not want them to know just thinking about the ministry made his blood boil he could not believe that fudge and his cronies were being so stupid and blind they were going to get people killed if they did not allow them to properly prepare it was with this in mind that harry now spent most of his time studying defense against the dark arts his studies were remarkably different than the dull reading umbridge assigned harry focused on anything he thought could be useful his knowledge of curses was already pretty extensive thanks to the tri wizard tournament but his studies had increased this knowledge greatly in the d a harry was trying to put the knowledge to good use it had only taken a few sessions for him to realize that most people desperately needed to master the basics thus the majority of the d a meeting was focused on the simple hexes and jinxes expelliarmus impedimenta diffindo and stupefy were the main four along with the more offensive spells every meeting spent sometime on protego which he was convinced was going to be an extremely useful spell after his experience with snape however harry was also aware that thanks to multiple comments from zacharias smith no one wanted to only practice simple spells conjuring spells like incararcerous avis and aguamenti were also practiced smith had been rather vocal about not seeing how sending birds or water at an opponent was useful a quick duel had shown him how useful a distracting and unexpected type of attack could be that they were all sixth year spells was also seen as impressive harry was trying to build them up to casting a patronus arranging meetings had become much easier after hermione had figured out the protean charm she had charmed fake galleons to display the time and day of the next meeting everyone had been extremely impressed as the charm was extremely complicated the amazement had been broken by ron suggesting that she do the same to her history of magic notes his suggestion had not been well received the other activity that he had anticipated enjoying but now found dreadful was helping ron with his animagus transformation ron was showing no more talent at the transformation than he was at quiddtich harry was beginning to wonder if there was any hope for him the most ron had been able to achieve was making his nails slightly longer the rest of term crawled by slowly fred and george seemed to tire of harassing umbridge and had returned to testing products for their joke shop the inevitable confrontation between them and hermione had occurred with hermione forcing them to back down only by threatening to tell their mother the result had not been what hermione had anticipated harry was sure the twins had stopped testing their products on first years and had turned to testing it on themselves although they secretly confided in harry and ginny that most of the uncomfortable part of the research was done hermione had been indignant for a week when they had started to sell skiving snackboxes but she could not find a rule to stop them then she had caught ron with a few during the last few days of term the resulting row had been extraordinary harry and ginny had sat transfixed as the argument went from prefect responsibilities to personal lives when it had reached the latter the row had exploded ron had accused hermione of writing to krum hermione had not responded as harry had expected instead of denying it she had admitted it and said that at least krum had enough courage to ask a girl out ron had then accused her of consorting with the enemy the next day ron and hermione spoke only in clipped tones but harry took it as a good sign that they were speaking at all unfortunately harry was wrong the next night ron and hermione were once again arguing fiercely about their personal lives harry wished ginny was there she would be better at understanding what exactly the problem was if she did not understand what it was then she would have solved the problem simply by hexing one or both of them but ginny was not there she was serving detention with filch after being making a flippant remark about umbridge making a better toad than a person in dada normally she would have eagerly helped him but all of her attention was focused on carefully repotting some rather dangerous plants i don t consort with the enemy you do ron said pronouncing each word like a whip hermione looked like if she were any angrier her bushy hair would explode in flame no you just try to kill him for dating your sister i apologized for that you insufferable know it all harry groaned ha that why i doing better in all my classes than you because i study unlike you you spend all your time playing that stupid game quidditch responded hermione harry had a sense of foreboding quidditch was a very sensitive subject for ron right now oh really ron voice had taken on a reckless tone and harry knew instinctively he needed to stop what ever the redhead was going to say he began moving toward them but it was too late ron opened his mouth well i learning to be an animagus hermione eyes went wide and several emotions crossed over her face she rounded not on ron but on the approaching harry you are teaching him it would have been futile to deny it so he nodded and not me her voice was small and betrayed she did not wait for an answer and ran up to her dormitory what did you have to do that for demanded harry as he rounded on ron ron looked shocked and mortified i didntmean to i just i you wanted to show her up that what you meant to do accused harry in a frustrated voice harry waved off further attempts by ron to apologize and went to bed he would talk to ginny tomorrow and figure out what to do harry woke with a sudden yell and his hand went to his scar it was burning painfully voldemort was extremely irritated and frustrated something had gone wrong he looked around no one else in the dormitory was awake he knew that seamus and dean after almost five years had grown used to loud sounds due to ron and neville snores it came as no real surprise when the door to the dormitory creaked open and admitted a mane of red hair are you all right asked ginny as she sat on the edge of harry bed one of her hands clasping his yeah but voldemort angry it must be something big for this to happen should we tell dumbledore harry considered in the morning i donteven know what he angry about ginny nodded and pushed him over so that there was room on the bed for her to lie down harry willingly wrapped his arms around her and chuckled quietly before whispering in her ear ron you know your brother who happens to be in the bed next to us is more understanding but i think you re trying to push him over the edge i donthear you complaining unless you want me to leave she teased back mentally no as if to emphasize his statement harry arms tightened around her just pointing out the obvious he cantget mad at you anyway why that asked harry thinking that ron still would not take well to seeing his little sister in bed with him because he told hermione about the animagus training she responding with a hint of frustration and anger at the carelessness of her brother what are we going to do about that figure it out tomorrow ginny sent as she closed her eyes harry smiled and closed his eyes contentedly his previous scar trouble forgotten a n here the next chapter i broke it into two chapters as 11000 words seemed a little much for one chapter sorry for the rather slow update but i had a lot of stuff come up at once and then i got sick thanks for the reviews disclaimer i make no claims on what jkr has written chapter 19 tears the flames in the fireplace glowed green and ginny weasley came tumbling out she ignored the sitting albus dumbledore and ran to harry tightly wrapping her arms around him and burying her head into his chest harry moved his arms to her waist and tried to hold her closer harry vaguely registered that dumbledore spoke but could not make out the individual words nor did he notice when the aged professor left albus dumbledore said a quick goodbye but doubted that either harry or ginny heard him and edged out of the room not much scared albus dumbledore but the sheer amount of power radiating off the intertwined couple did gazing thoughtfully at the closed door dumbledore decided to wait in the kitchen for the rest of the weasleys to return he suspected that harry and ginny would not want to be separated tonight molly weasley would need to be warned eventually ginny pushed back from harry embrace so that she could look up into his face i cantlose you she choked out her eyes turning misty harry met her gaze and brought his hand up to cup her cheek she leaned into his hand his heart felt like it was breaking just thinking about life without her he leaned in and kissed her the kiss was hard and needful ginny returned it with the same intensity their kisses became more frantic as they tried to convince themselves that the other was never going to die i dontcare i need to see harry came the booming voice of mrs weasley neither harry nor ginny heard it nor did they notice when the door open harry did however sense a change in the air when mrs weasley entered his eyes rose and widened and he froze his mouth still firmly planted on ginny neck mrs weasley was standing in the doorway eyes wide and mouth open harry face blushed crimson and disappeared into ginny surrounding hair he did not recall precisely how he and ginny had gone from kissing to well this harry was seated with ginny on top of him his hands had found their way beneath ginny shirt which had also become partially undone his own shirt was lying several feet away ginny still had one of her hands buried in his hair holding his head to her neck her other hand was on his backside harry blinked no mrs weasley was not going to like this ex excuse me mrs weasley voice was strained ginny released her hold on harry hair and backside in order to smooth out her rumpled blouse she stood and checked her blouse buttons before turning around she did not even try and fix her tangled hair harry being as inconspicuous as the situation allowed tried to edge around her so that he could reach his shirt yes mum she figured if her mum was going to act like nothing was wrong neither would she i i actually wanted to speak to harry said mrs weasley her voice strangely distant she closed her eyes for a full two seconds before opening them again harry had just stuck his head out of his shirt and was twisting it around once he had both arms through the right holes he answered yes mrs weasley mrs weasley pale face colored i wanted she seemed to be struggling to remember why she had been so determined to speak to harry i wanted to ask if you would use your phoenix tears to help heal arthur ginny cocked an eyebrow at her mother i guess she come around to the idea of us being animagi why not just use fawkes i should have thought of this harry chided himself that a brilliant idea but why not have fawkes heal him asked harry dumbledore entered the room and placed his hands on mrs weasley shoulders from behind steering her from the doorway so he could enter fawkes tried but the wounds refused to heal perhaps with two phoenixes the poison can be counteracted when are we going asked ginny the previous awkwardness of the situation forgotten with the thought of helping her father in the morning dumbledore answered again mrs weasley frowned she obviously wanted her husband healed as soon as possible both he and tonks will be fine until then come molly i have something to discuss with you and sirius turning to harry he added i will talk to you tomorrow harry ginny leaned over harry shoulder and whispered into his ear sometimes sometimes mind you dumbledore isnthalf bad harry heard her words but was too affected by the feeling of her warm breath on his ear and the scent of wildflowers from her hair to think rational thoughts or to form any type of agreement that sounded vaguely coherent this time it was not mrs weasley voice that woke him but the light creeping through the window harry stretched and decided to go take a shower ginny said something as he left the bed but it was too muffled for him to make out he leaned over and kissed her forehead and then opened his trunk to find a clean robe harry shoved several robes aside that he knew were dirty before finding one near the bottom that was clean he was about to close the trunk when he saw the word fate written in gold lettering peaking out underneath some balled up socks moving the socks to the side revealed a book with the title why wizards dontmeddle with time fate wrath it felt like his stomach had turned to ice he had completely forgotten about the book he remembered thinking that it would be an interesting read when hermione had given it to him but now its title struck fear into him harry pulled the book out the trunk allowing the jostled socks to fall the knobbly pair from uncle vernon fell with a thunk a thunk harry reached for the socks and found that there was something inside of him it took him a moment to remember that he had stuffed the sneakoscope from ron in them a little afraid to read the book harry was grateful for the distraction and extracted the item it immediately stood on end and began emitting a high pitched sound although it was not very loud harry frowned it seemed like all he was getting was bad news this morning harry what wrong came ginny sleepy voice er noth began harry tell me or i ll make you tell me said ginny cutting him off and sitting up she was dressed only in one his shirts harry blushed at the memory there had been little awkwardness the bond allowed them to know what the other liked which spot to caress suckle or kiss and what the other was comfortable with it also made each of them painfully aware of the other fears and insecurities it had the strange effect of egging them on but also slowing them down at the same time they had cooled off remarkably quickly though when mrs weasley walked by the door talking to sirius looking at ginny harry blush deepened he was looking forward to being alone with ginny soon ginny eyes narrowed and glittered with mischief then you had better tell me what wrong i unable to find the words he pointed to the sneakoscope ginny expression mirrored his own do you think someone in the house isnttrustful she asked no i mean it only us your mum the twins ron and sirius stated harry casting another worried look at the sneakoscope if i hadntdestroyed mrs black portrait i would have said it was her what about kreacher pressed ginny he has to be trustful now sirius gave him very specific orders the sneakoscope continued to emit the sound despite their logic maybe it broken ginny tone said she did not believe it herself dumbledore coming will be over today we ll tell him then harry picked up the dark detector and stuffed it back inside the socks i also found this harry tossed the book on the bed i going to go take a shower ginny nodded briefly considered taking a shower with him which caused them both to blush she did not did not move her gaze from the book she opened the book to the table of contents page she sucked in breath quickly as she read the page and wondered if the harry from the future had read this book the book was organized into two sections theory and examples the examples were further broken out into what technique or spell the wizard or witch had used to the side of each name was either the word success or failure only the section with the heading time turners and other such devices had any successes she shivered as she flipped through the next few pages the last two pages of the table of contents listed all known attempts at using the ritual dumbledore had told them about there were no successes she flipped back to the beginning of the table of contents and searched for the appropriate page listed under theory and turned to it ritual debt of fate or ritual of fate debt perhaps the most desperate drastic and dangerous of all time meddling the ritual known as the debt of fate is shrouded in mystery the origin is unknown but wizards since recorded history have attempted this ritual with no known success see example horus the ritual is used to send a message back through time according to early writings about the ritual there is no danger of a time paradox as with the ever popular time turner early writings about the ritual report that fate or destiny would weigh the caster request and then judge if he or she had been treated unfairly and if the message to be sent was justified this is where the name of the ceremony originates however the cost of having fate judge the request is high the caster life if it was judged that fate did indeed owe a debt to the caster then the message is allowed to pass it is hypothesized that along with the caster sheer magical power the castor own lifeforce the soul itself is used to send a message back through time to him or herself despite the complete lack of evidence that the ritual has ever resulted in any message being sent back through time the ritual is still occasionally attempted in the early part of the sixteenth century it gained prominence as a method of suicide as a result of the many attempts at the ritual it was decided by the international confederation of wizards in 1554 that information related to how to perform the ritual would henceforth be restricted although the ritual has been compared to the ritual required to create a it is not believed to be dark magic the ritual requires the use of as of 1554 the international confederation of wizards has decreed decree 1101 that information that could be used to conduct the ritual of fate debt restricted information for further information contact your local ministry of magic and see icw decree 1101 edit required by international confederation of wizards decree 1112 of 1557 edit required by international confederation of wizards decree 1101 and 1112 ginny sighed as she closed the book it had not told her anything more than what dumbledore had revealed to harry yesterday reading the book however had caused her to revisit her thoughts of the previous night she wondered what she would do if harry died facing voldemort she knew with certainty it would tear her in two she looked back down at the book and felt a wave of hopelessness and loss pass through her as she imagined what harry had felt she hardly noticed the tears that started to fall harry did not bother to turn the water off when he felt ginny starting to cry the only time he wasted was to grab a towel off the rack as he rushed back to ginny room ginny dontcry neither of us is going to die he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her into his lap ginny sniffled i being stupid i was just thinking about what it would be like if you died then i thought about that you had lived like that then i thought what you must had been feeling when you performed the ritual and then ginny was interrupted by harry kissing her listen to me i dontknow how things are going to end but i do know i didntsend that letter back so we could be miserable ginny laid her head on his bare shoulder and hugged him tightly i dontwant to live without you placing his head on top of hers harry shivered at the thought of losing her neither do i a soft knock at the door interrupted them it was not mrs weasley voice that echoed through the door but sirius harry ginny you re leaving soon for st mungo s molly is going to come up soon i ll just go turn the water off shall i they quickly dressed and made their way downstairs where the rest of the weasleys were waiting for them a light breakfast was on the table sirius gave them a roguish wink that made harry believe the marauder had seen him go into ginny room in only a towel dumbledore sent word that he would meet you there he bringing fawkes with him too fifteen minutes later and after everyone had eaten they met mundungus fletcher who was driving a different car than the one he had used to get them to st mungo the first time why cantwe just floo ginny did last night and it would be quicker complained ron as he slid into the back seat of the sedan we ll just apparate over said fred sharing a devious expression with george mrs weasley rounded on them fred george get in the car i will not have you sneaking off to get more of your your useless inventions after i ve searched you the twins did not look happy but complied mrs weasley had searched both of them before they left the house she had confiscated three sets of extendable ears two vials of an unknown potion and a package of dungbombs ron grumbled again about flooing hush ron we arentsupposed to use the floo dumbledore thinks the network is being watched the trip to st mungo was quick despite ron complaints and dumbledore was waiting for them in mr weasley and tonks room fawkes was perched on the headboard of tonks bed and gave a welcoming trill we already tried fawkes professor stated a perplexed bill weasley harry turned surprise to see the eldest weasley son dumbledore eyes twinkled yes but i believe the tears of two phoenixes will be more powerful than one alone two where the other one asked bill tonks snickered which only added to bill confusion dumbledore closed the door and flicked his wand before nodded to harry i the other one stated harry what rather than explain the situation harry chose to transform bill took a step back in shock i ll be merlin he an animagus that amazing mrs weasley grumpily replied so is ginny really what are you asked bill excitedly ginny smiled broadly she knew bill had tried to become an animagus and for him to be this happy over her achievement meant a lot i a panther bill nodded and winked at her no surprise there dumbledore chuckled harry fawkes would you begin i would rather not be caught using a silencing charm by any of the healers harry flew to tonks bedside and waited patiently while mrs weasley carefully removed the bandages around her foot it started to bleed immediately fawkes was the first to act his pearly tears falling the blood stopped flowing but the wound did not heal focusing on the wound harry again found it impossible to cry sing came fawkes command you must see the wound harry did as he was told just like what had happened with hagrid harry could see a white light escaping from the wound the bright light escaping from tonks wound though was nothing compared to the almost blinding light coming from mr weasley abdomen focus on this one first instructed fawkes his tears soon joined fawkes and the wound started to close when the skin was no longer marred they stopped crying for a few seconds it looked like they had succeeded but the skin where the wound had been stated to release smoke or steam and the smell of flesh burning rose tonks muffled a scream your mate must help said fawkes and then he chirped at ginny dumbledore raised his eyebrows at the action but said nothing ginny cast a worried look at her mother before walking forward when she transformed into a phoenix a collective gasp was heard from the group only ron and dumbledore did not act surprised ron allowed himself a smug smile and dumbledore only looked amused ginny flew to perch on the opposite side of tonks foot so that the three phoenixes formed a triangle around the wounded appendage the tears of the three phoenixes stopped the blood from flowing and forced the wound to close however this time a smoke began to rise up from the wound when the wound finally closed the phoenixes hopped aside and waited nothing happened tonks immediately swung her feet off the bed and tested her weight on her foot she jumped up and down a couple of times and smiled i healed she exclaimed and then promptly tripped over the bed frame corner am i still healed she asked disgusted what are you looking at heal him tonks said to the phoenixes trying to shift the attention from her and ignore the snickering and laughing at the same time fawkes flew over to mr weasley bed but harry and ginny took a brief moment to chirp in obvious amusement before joining him the room went quiet as mrs weasley slowly undid the bandages mr weasley wound was far worse than tonks and it too began bleeding immediately when the bandages were removed fawkes was the first to start crying halting the bleeding then harry tears began falling which were soon joined by ginny after she had given a short trill whereas tonks wound had produced only a little smoke mr weasley wound practically billowed smoke it strongly reminded harry of the basilisk venom eating through riddle diary and he wondered exactly what type of snake had bitten mr weasley it took nearly a minute for the wound to heal well done well done congratulated dumbledore mrs weasley had rushed to her husband side as soon as the phoenixes had left the bed and was giving him one of her bone crushing hugs the others in the room aside from ron seemed to still be in shock from ginny phoenix transformation harry and ginny transformed back into themselves in front of the astonished crowd mrs weasley did not look like she knew how to respond as she seemed to be on the verge of scolding and praising them at the same time you re a phoenix too bill asked rhetorically ginny had the grace to blush as she smiled several people started to talk at once excuse me dumbledore calm voice resonated throughout the room everyone stopped talking how does he do that asked ginny magic came harry slightly sarcastic reply ginny cut her eyes at him and then raised her eyebrows in an expression that clearly stated maybe we can discuss this discovery when we return to headquarters now why dontwe have arthur and ms tonks examined by the healers so that they may leave it was worded as a suggestion but dumbledore words were clearly an order two hours later everyone was back at grimmauld place sitting at the kitchen table an occasional snicker was heard causing mr weasley to blush in embarrassment the healer had been highly skeptical of his sudden healing skills even professor dumbledore explaining fawkes assistance could not assuage the healer that everything was fine the healer had insisted that mr weasley since his wound was far more serious strip down so he could carefully examine his entire body the healer seemed to fear that the wound would magically appear elsewhere it had taken an hour for the healer to finish his examination mr weasley emerged from the room walking funny and thoroughly embarrassed the twins were in their element eager to shift the attention away from himself mr weasley said so you re a phoenix too ginny the twins went silent as the discussion turned to animagi professor how is it possible for harry and ginny to be animagi magical animagi at that asked bill harry could swear that dumbledore smirked the mystery does not stop there william harry and ginny both have panther forms bill swore earning him a smack from mrs weasley sorry mum how is this possible asked bill for the second time dumbledore locked eyes with harry who realized what the professor was asking harry nodded his assent i believe it is because of their soul bond bill eyes widened and the twins mouths dropped open tonks reacted by tipping over her glass of juice i suspect that the phoenix form is from harry how harry manages a magical form is a mystery but mr potter has always surprised us dumbledore smiled and paused waiting for any interruptions when no one interrupted he continued as you said yourself ginny panther form is no surprise no bonded pair has ever bonded before they became animagi and i believe the bond allowed them to share forms concluded dumbledore brilliant announced fred absolutely spiffing added george a harsh glare from mrs weasley silenced them they re bonded soul bonded questioned bill we are right here complained ginny causing bill to give her an apologetic smile yes it was detected and recorded the very first time they met on platform nine and three quarters explained dumbledore bill looked at the headmaster like he was crazy that impossible surprisingly it was not dumbledore who answered but sirius so are magical animagi a long silence followed sirius statement mr weasley was the first to break it does this have something to do with the prophecy arthur bellowed a very unhappy mrs weasley who was now glaring at her children as if hoping that her gaze alone could remove the memory of what her husband had said that enough children out but mum chorused the twins we re of age you are still my children said mrs weasley sternly sirius tonks and even professor dumbledore seemed unwilling to challenge the weasley matriarch molly said the tired voice of mr weasley they are of age you cant force them to leave harry needs to stay said sirius quietly but with steel in his voice although he had pushed his chair back far enough so that he was well out of mrs weasley arm reach mrs weasley gave her husband a betrayed look but gave a look of pure disgust to sirius fine ron leave why she so mad at sirius asked a confused harry because if you stay i staying harry almost laughed at the affronted look that appeared on ron face harry will just tell me everything later besides what about ginny mrs weasley seemed to be approaching her breaking point there no point in sending ginny away her tone was defeated but she quickly rebounded you however have to leave no i staying ron said considering the slightly crazed look in his mother eyes harry thought ron was being absurdly brave the twins must have agreed because they were looking at ron with a mixture of awe and sympathy they must have guessed what was coming oh you are are you ron fidgeted nervously do you want to be cooking your own meals for the rest of the vacation ron paled i thought not now why dontyou wait in the sitting room hermione will be arriving shortly ron nodded excitedly either out of anticipation of hermione arrival or out of relief of escaping his mother punishment he quickly stood and left the kitchen dumbledore waited for mrs weasley to cast the appropriate charms on the door before starting as most of you know a prophecy was made shortly before harry birth dumbledore case a worried glance at harry and ginny a death eater heard a part of the prophecy and passed it on to lord voldemort who then acted on it by attacking harry parents on halloween it was his downfall dumbledore closed his eyes collecting his thoughts the question you have asked is far more complicated than you realize but at this point i do not believe it is important anymore the soul bond has given both harry and ginny a natural resistance to voldemort mental intrusions dumbledore went on to explain exactly what a soul bond was and how it affected harry and ginny reactions varied across the table those who already knew listened attentively hoping to hear dumbledore say something new while tonks and bill gained expressions that steadily grew more and more amazed their eyes grew as wide as saucers and their mouths were in danger of touching the table fred and george reacted differently this explains so much said george fred smiled it was always obvious you two were meant to be together but are you really able to talk mentally harry and ginny nodded that fantastic oh imagine how much easier classes would be you could do half the work ouch fred stopped talking as ginny foot impacted his shin i must stress how important it is for this knowledge to remain outside of the public knowledge for as long as possible said dumbledore what about the record at the ministry asked mr weasley dumbledore opened his mouth and then shut it as if reconsidering his words we cant stop anyone from checking the book but the regular schedule for ministry inspection will not pose a problem an order member has seen to it more questions were about to ask when dumbledore cocked his head and then said i think that is enough for today harry thought dumbledore looked troubled besides i believe miss granger has arrived dumbledore waved his wand removing the charms placed on the door just in time to hear ron jubilant cry hermione this was quickly followed by hermione voice which was too soft for anyone to make out however the two voices that followed pronounced every word clearly and loudly ahhh isntthat just it was one of the twins who had made their way quickly out of the kitchen in time to see hermione entrance isntthat the sweetest thing you have ever seen verily i think our little ronnikins is growing up harry could almost see ron ears and then his face turning red yes i agree but look so is little hermy and i think ronnikins has finally noticed harry and ginny were both sure that given the opportunity the twins would have continued but two voices started yelling a mixture of obscenities demands and threats from the look on mrs weasley face harry thought that both ron and hermione were lucky they were both yelling otherwise their words might have been decipherable everyone began filing out of the kitchen bill placed a hand on ginny shoulder and motioned toward the other door harry was following sirius when dumbledore stopped them both harry dumbledore extended his hand it was holding an envelope harry recognized as the one percy had given him these are a summons sirius face immediately darkened you should read it but i want to assure you that there is nothing they are charging you with that we cannot defend against it really is a rather weak attempt by fudge and i daresay the goal is to discredit rather than convict harry looked down at the envelope and sighed the trial date is set for december 28th i suggest you push this out of your mind i will take care of the defense enjoy your holiday and a strange expression crossed dumbledore face as he seemed to peer around the room searching for something why dontyou and ginny take the weasley to potter manor for christmas i d like for you to stay here most of the time but a few days at the manor i dontthink will hurt i will be back shortly after christmas he smiled at sirius and harry before turning to leave dumbledore worried about something harry stated hoping sirius had an answer yes but what sirius responded and cast a look at harry the trial no i trust dumbledore when he says he can handle it it something else he been getting tenser since the start of term said sirius it was then that harry remembered he had wanted to ask dumbledore about the sneakoscope sirius do you know anything about sneakoscopes sirius gave him a funny look at the sudden change of topic and had to mentally shake himself except for the eyes harry was almost a mirror image of james and he even had some of the elder potter mannerisms james also had a habit of changing topics rather quickly granted most of the times it was to monologue about evans a little ron gave me one in my third year and i took it out last night it acted like someone untrustful was nearby harry could not believe how good it felt to get even this little secret off his chest there seemed to be a lot of secrets lately sirius looked through one of the kitchen walls which also happened to be in the direction of the boiler well kreacher is in the house sirius and harry considered the possibility and the evil little pigmy has been acting strangely of late strangely asked harry he thought sirius orders would force the house elf to be trustful he not nearly as repugnant as usual and he been cleaning said sirius since you destroyed the portrait of my dear mum the change has become even more pronounced not kreacher then harry asked i want to say it is but i dontthink it possible for him to lie or betray us anymore i ve made my orders very specific and i think having dobby and winky here over the summer scared him i think he now thinks that i might replace him sirius smiled at the notion before you arrived i would have suggested mum a wry smile crossed sirius face you know i think i ll frame that scorch mark harry chuckled and they both left the kitchen to welcome hermione in one of the private sitting rooms bill was sitting across from ginny he had not said a word since leading her into the room ginny thought he was struggling to find the right words aside from ron bill was probably her most protective brother his age made his relationship with her a cross between father and brother you and harry ginny do you understand all of the implications of being bonded to harry asked bill ginny was not exactly sure what her oldest brother was getting at but decided to start with what she guessed would bother him the most it means were married bill waved his hand dismissively and then froze married i didntknow bill seemed flustered and ginny knew her brother well enough to know that he was striving to control himself no not that i mean it dangerous with you know who back we know he after harry because of some prophecy and i think it would be best ginny anger started to stir it must have shown on her face because bill immediately backtracked i not saying you shouldntbe with harry i just want to make sure that you know what to expect ginny felt harry emotions swirl at bill words maybe shut up harry she knew what he was going to suggest and it was ridiculous as far as she was concerned and just what should i expect ginny was not sure what he was getting at bill again fumbled for words he had obviously not planned this out i only want you to understand that you re going to have to be protected bill voice trailed off as he watched ginny face flush and groaned ginny hated it when her brothers were overprotective it usually ended up with a hexing just like harry has to be protected please dontbe difficult about it the eldest weasley son closed his eyes and waited for the hex his reaction caused ginny to release a small giggle i not going to hex you you re not mad not as long as you dontsay that i have to stay away from harry answered ginny that goes for you too she mentally sent to harry bill smiled and then his brow furrowed now what do you mean married a n review responses can be found via the link on my profile disclaimer see chapter 1 chapter 20 show trial ginny and harry had ferried the weasleys hermione sirius remus and tonks to potter manor on the morning of christmas eve after a brief tour mrs weasley disappeared to the kitchen to start on what would no doubt be a gargantuan dinner harry briefly wondered how she would manage to convince the house elves to allow her to do the cooking sirius remus and bill had disappeared somewhere on the manor grounds while the twins were busy decorating this left harry ginny ron and hermione alone i going to go back to the library okay said hermione it had taken all her self restraint not to explore each tome in the library when the tour had stopped there we ve got a better idea ginny said smiling mischievously would you like to open your christmas present early added harry hermione was clearly torn i can wait til morning she took a step in the library direction before harry hand stopped her but the present can t said harry trying to be as mysterious as possible he right we might not get a chance to give it to you tomorrow prodded ginny okay hermione said suspiciously ron was looking on in bewilderment it was not until they had reached the potions lab in the basement that he realized what harry and ginny were going to give hermione wow this lab is amazing no wonder your potion marks are so good commented hermione we ve got a special potion for you if you want it ginny said while holding a vile of green liquid before the suspicions hermione what is it she asked she looked at the three standing before her harry and ginny had smirks on their faces while ron was beaming at her then she made a leap of logic that so typified hermione is this the animagus potion oh thank you thank you she hugged harry first and then almost toppled ginny with her hug careful this is the only vial came ginny muffled warning sorry i when did you make this she asked recovering her composure it the other half to the potion we made for ron if you want to try it though you need to take it soon the potion will go bad in another month explained harry hermione did not say anything only smiled and then downed the potion in one swallow harry and ginny both tried to stop her but were too late ron was barely able to catch her before she fell to the cold concrete that was quick he muttered as he dragged her over to the wall and balled up his outer cloak so that her head could lie on it after thirty minutes they were starting to get worried after forty five minutes ginny left to find sirius or remus ten minutes later she returned with sirius what happened sirius asked as he leaned over the still unconscious hermione she took the animagus revealer potion supplied ron who was dangerously close to exploding with worry what wrong asked harry sirius shushed them and continued to examine hermione she fine this happened to peter how long has she been like this about an hour now said ginny from sirius left she should wake up soon sirius sat down beside the unconscious girl ron slid down the wall which his back had been leaning against so that he was seated at hermione feet what happened sirius smiled at the redhead worry nothing bad she just probably cantfind her form some people donthave them but wormtail sirius face darkened at the mention of peter yes we found a way for him to become an animagus there another potion that can be made it more specific to the drinker and takes a long time to brew what takes a long time to brew asked a groggy hermione you re awake announced a jubilant ron the statement seemed to bring hermione to full consciousness oh no i didntsee a form hermione eyes misted in disappointment i should have expected this i mean having an animagus form is rare attempts to interrupt hermione were ignored of those very few can actually perform the transformation since it requires immense concentration force of will and wandless magic hermione screamed several voices she stopped talking and blinked at them her mouth was still open and it gave her a goldfish appearance harry and ginny laughed sirius smirked there another potion said ron hermione head swiveled to face ron what i haventread about any other potion that because it very rare said sirius his smirk becoming a grin how do you know hermione seemed to be taking it personally that she did not know about the potion given the fact that she had probably read every book in the hogwarts library on the topic harry could understand this sirius chuckled before responding what books have you read everything in the hogwarts library and the book mcgonagall just published responded hermione her lips pursing at the end as if trying to remember anything that those books might have mentioned about an alternative potion first the book isntin the hogwarts library and mcgonagall would not have put it into her book the potion is considered extremely dangerous but personally i think the ministry just doesntwant the information out in the public domain a lot more wizards could become animagi if it became widely known sirius explained how did you find out about it queried hermione peter the name was almost spat didnthave a form with the normal potion james was certain he had read about another potion we spent the entire term before christmas rereading every book hogwarts had it wasntuntil we got back here that we found the book hermione looked upwards in the library direction as if imagining what other secrets it held she looked back to sirius i do have a form then there was a slight tone of pleading in her voice if peter has a form i sure you do answered sirius christmas was unlike anything harry had ever experienced ginny had warned him what to expect and he had seen both ginny and ron enthusiasm at hogwarts but having almost the entire weasley clan minus percy and charlie along with sirius remus and tonks was a bit overwhelming as far as gifts went christmas was rather bare since most of the people present did not have the time or the money for them sirius while having both time and money had not been allowed out of grimmauld place remus did not have the money for extravagant gifts both mr and mrs weasley had been very busy although there was plenty of homemade fudge and sweaters tonks had not even been expecting to be there finally bill while being paid well by gringotts was suspiciously poor the twins kept needling him about the french lessons he was taking mrs weasley had settled into an odd relationship with the house elves it turned out that neither had been able to kick the other out of the kitchen though not for lack of trying dinny and bonny had remained in the kitchen and both house elves seemed to have tried to compete with mrs weasley own cooking ability the result had been meals with giant sized portions corfy and ding had served the meal besides sirius no one present was used to being served by house elves hermione had been the most difficult much to the twins amusement she had kept trying to help the house elves serve everyone even after mrs weasley had given up unintentionally she had nearly brought the young ding to tears corfy had intervened at this point miss please stop corfy voice had taken on a slightly commanding tone that seemed out of place coming from a house elf hermione gaped at the elf you are insulting us we have lived in this house for over a decade without any master to serve we are happy to serve it brings us honor and pride hermione was not going to give in easily but you shouldnthave to enough corfy was obviously irritated do you not understand how house elves come into existence why we serve hermione shook her head house elves are born of the house they serve by the house very magic this is the reason why we only exist in the oldest of wizarding households everyone was listening intently to corfy explanation and harry thought he now understood why there were so many house elves at hogwarts if we are set free we will die unless we find some other household to draw magic from hermione sat in discomfort until it was alleviated about halfway through dinner sirius was telling a story about one of the marauders many pranks at hogwarts when corfy interrupted him by chiding elbows off the table mr black even more amusing to seeing a house elf giving an order was seeing sirius absently follow it what he asked as several people snickered he looked around at the amused faces and explained corfy was responsible for most of james and when i think about it my training in manners etiquette and such some are harder to teach than others muttered corfy as he removed several dishes sirius glowered harry sighed as he got dressed in his best black robes ginny brushed her hands over his shoulders and down his back trying to get out any errant creases she did not even bother trying to get his hair to lie flat she knew better the sun still had not risen but that was as it should be the trial was due to start at eight harry would be going to the ministry escorted by mr weasley dumbledore had been by the day before to reassure everyone that he had things under control but had not stayed long harry looked around the room he really did not like being back at grimmauld place after returning from potter manor while dobby and winky had achieved major improvements and wonders of wonders kreacher seemed to be making slow progress himself grimmauld place still had a dreary and very depressing atmosphere walking downstairs he found that mrs weasley had several dishes already prepared mr weasley was eating some eggs while sirius had a little bit of everything on his plate ginny shoved him into a chair and grabbed a piece of toast harry followed her example their nerves preventing them from eating anything more substantial i think we should be going dumbledore said to make sure we arrived early we re also going the muggle way mr weasley could not hide the excitement in his voice at the prospect by the time they exited the underground harry nerves had reached unparalleled heights ginny kept trying to reassure him but it did not help she was more nervous than he was when mr weasley and he had stopped walking outside an out of order phone booth harry had taken to repeating dumbledore words in his head like a mantra it going to be fine harry was barely amused when mr weasley punched 62442 into the telephone keypad he shook his head when he realized that the numbers stood for magic his slightly better mood was ruined when he looked at the badge the telephone had spat out it read harry potter standing trial although harry had been to the ministry before with dumbledore it was the first time he had been to the ministry on a busy day the fireplaces on either side of the atrium would flare green and a wizard or witch would appear most of them walking out of the fireplaces in much better form than harry would have mr weasley led him to the familiar desk with a guard who this time did not look bored wand please the guard said addressing harry harry handed his wand over after performing the same check the other guard had when dumbledore was with him he handed harry back his wand and kept the receipt mr weasley rushed him past the guard when the man started asking if he really was the harry potter as the elevator descended harry made a guess as to where the courtroom was located we re going to the department of mysteries mr weasley frowned no but nearby remember dumbledore said that this was going to be more of a show than a trial harry nodded only courtroom 10 is large enough to hold the majority of the wizengamot and it is located at the lowest level of the ministry mr weasley tone has clipped and harry could detect the man nerves underneath it that the same tone dad uses when he doesntwant to tell us something worried ginny courtroom 10 was down the same corridor he and dumbledore had taken to the department of mysteries but then they took a flight of stairs down another level harry shivered slightly this was not a courtroom but a dungeon a door not dissimilar to the one that opened into snape potions lab was where mr weasley stopped harry i cantfollow you in i sure dumbledore will be inside waiting mr weasley gave him a weak smile as harry disappeared into the room the walls were dark stone and the room was dimly lit by torches in the back were benches harry assumed were for spectators there were a few present already from the parchment and quills they had at the ready harry guessed they were reporters in the center of the room was a chair with chains on its arms on legs despite the horror this chair invoked harry felt immensely relieved at the sight since just to the right of the chair was another chair a plush red armchair in this armchair albus dumbledore was sitting serenely beyond the intimidating chair and dumbledore was the judges balcony it was huge harry guessed it could seat at least fifty ah harry you re here said dumbledore with a comforting smile he cast a glace at the chained chair and spoke again would you like to sit here or shall i draw a chair for you as well dumbledore eyes were twinkling madly harry gave him a small smile that would be great the relief in his voice was evident the chair dumbledore conjured landed on the floor with a soft thud and harry sat in the comfortable furniture the members of the wizengamot were starting to file in they each wore a plum cloak with an intricate w stenciled on the left breast in the center sat fudge looking confident and arrogant to his right sat a witch harry knew all to well harry could not believe it even dressed in formal robes she still looked like a toad a purple toad i wish i had some of that powder now that would be nice i can see the headlines now undersecretary becomes toad no one notices for hours harry stifled a laugh with difficulty and returned to scrutinizing the other witches and wizards to fudge left sat another witch she looked very stern and had a monocle as the balcony filled with plum colored cloaks fudge stirred it is time to begin are you ready fudge turned his head and spoke a voice harry knew well answered yes sir percy weasley was at the end of the row with a quill and parchment very well fudge voice took on a pompous self assured tone disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august into offenses committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery the international statute of secrecy and general statutes 9013 and 132 by harry james potter resident of number four privet drive little whinging surrey several of the wizengamot members began leafing through a large book each had before them at the mention of the last statutes fudge waited for the rustle of papers to stop before continuing interrogators cornelius oswald fudge minister of magic amelia susan bones head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister and hogwarts high inquisitor and court scribe percy ignatius weasley and advocate and witness for the defense albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore harry was not sure how but dumbledore voice managed to be penetrating and quiet at the same time he thought that he could detect just a hint of challenge in the voice fudge frowned but did not comment immediately he shifted some parchment in front of him and then puffed himself up the charges then the charges against the accused harry james potter are two first he knowingly and in full knowledge of the respective statues used magic while at privet drive thereby breaking both the international statue of secrecy and the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery further the manner in which this offense was committed strongly suggests the violation of statute 9013 intent to harm a muggle or muggles through the use of magic second the accused is charged with two violation of statute 132 several members of the wizengamot were murmuring now yes violation of statute 132 there were several coughs and amelia bones who face looked like it had been set in stone leaned over and whispered to fudge who then said ah yes of course statute 132 states that no wizard or witch shall deprive a noble family of property or slander their good name dumbledore looked bored with fudge speech harry was trying to figure out exactly what he had done he could not remember ever violating any of those statutes as far as harry or ginny could remember the only time he had ever violated the decree for underage sorcery was when he had been blamed for dobby hover charm fudge was not finished and now that he had announced the charges his attention shifted to harry harry james potter you are charged with performing magic between the months of june and september to create potions that were then used to deliberately harm a muggle who lives at number 4 privet drive little whinging surrey by the name of dudley daniel dursley harry felt his jaw drop first he had no idea what fudge was talking about second he had not known dudley middle name was daniel and he wondered briefly if the dursleys had really liked the letter d for some reason albus dumbledore rose from his chair his figure was impressive and several of the wizengamot members leaned back in their chairs dumbledore was positively radiating power as harry watched dumbledore he wondered if the headmaster was intentionally allowing everyone to feel his power minister fudge i am afraid that you will have to explain the charges in more detail and be more precise in the dates harry potter spent very little time at privet drive this summer dumbledore said dolores umbridge put a pudgy hand on top of fudge s signaling that she would take over you do not command this court now sit down we must now interrogate mr potter harry could not believe the gall of the toad like woman from the looks of the other wizards in the room he was not alone in this sentiment madam umbridge you are mistaken dumbledore tone was dangerously low as the advocate of the accused i have every right to demand that the charges be explained in detail the sounds of chairs scratching along the floor as their owners reflexively pushed away from dumbledore for the first time harry could clearly understand why voldemort feared dumbledore this man standing before him was not an aged and sometimes senile headmaster but the man who had faced grindelwald and won the man who had stood against voldemort in his first rise and above all an extremely powerful wizard umbridge paled but answered on july the sixteenth members from the accidental magical reversal squad responded to a magical spike in the vicinity of number 4 privet drive they found one dudley dursley had consumed a potion that had caused him to transform into a pig dumbledore beard twitched further investigation discovered two other vials of potion that would have resulted in transformations of two other animal forms a giraffe and a hippo i believe harry was careful to maintain his confused look but inside he was groaning i forgot about those it must the potions the twins gave me they chose the forms well said ginny i think each vile was meant for one of those horrid muggles harry had to cough to stop the snicker that threatened his aunt petunia and uncle vernon would have made an excellent giraffe and hippo his mind quickly returned to the seriousness of his current predicament but why would dudley drink one analysis of these potions revealed that they had been altered so that they would not only taste like a sugary liquid but also would emit a highly intoxicating scent to a muggle continued umbridge answering harry silent question harry shook his head the twins had thought of everything he had not been around privet drive that much but he had discovered that dudley was on a strict diet it a wonder dudley didntdown all three of them before the first even took effect dumbledore sat back down in his chair before speaking again i move that the charges of violating the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy be dismissed immediately on what basis exclaimed a confused fudge dumbledore gave the court a small but confident smile you seem to have forgotten some of the central characteristics of the previously stated laws i sure it was only in your zeal to enforce them that you forgot that the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery does not apply to potions or their resulting effects dumbledore beard twitched again no matter how interesting their effects are several of the wizengamot members were nodding their heads affirming dumbledore words further the international statute of secrecy does not apply to muggles who already know magic exists and the dursleys despite their antipathy to magic i assure you have known before harry birth of magic existence harry noticed madam bones give fudge and umbridge a withering look the monocled women turned away from fudge and umbridge am i correct in interpreting that all the residents of number 4 privet drive know of magic existence and that mr potter is a wizard and hence any items found within his room would possibly be magical that is correct madam answered dumbledore again anger passed over madam bones face are there any here who dispute this statement madam bones said in a loud clear voice no one said a word very well then i move that the stated charges along with general statue 9013 be dismissed fudge and umbridge along with a few other members of the court looked appalled i must protest the muggles were clearly targeted by these potions they could have been seriously hurt said umbridge her voice falsely sweet be that as it may undersecretary umbridge the muggles residing at the house knew full well that anything found in mr potter room was potentially magical nor can it be proved that the potions were intended to do harm which despite the charges read by the minister caused no permanent injury to mr dudley dursley harry chanced a glance at professor dumbledore the professor eyes were twinkling madly further as head of the department of magical law enforcement i find it highly repugnant that these charges were even made the transformation of mr dursley is not something completely extraordinary i have it on good authority that the accidental magical reversal squad makes at least three visits a month to muggle households where an underage wizard has transformed accidentally or not a sibling into some creature umbridge deflated and fudge hung his head in frustration as bones called for a vote it was overwhelming in favor of dismissing the charges despite the turnaround fudge did not look defeated very well the previous mentioned charges are dismissed this proceeding will now move on to the charge of violating general statute 132 harry noticed that madam bones face was now stern and he felt his hopes plummet he had been hoping that she would move against that charge as well fudge smiled at the lack of comment and then continued mr potter on may thirtieth in the year 1993 did you or did you not trick the noble lord lucius malfoy into setting his house elf free this is about dobby asked harry perplexed ginny however wanted to know something else when did malfoy become a lord harry looked to dumbledore for guidance unsure if he should answer dumbledore met his eyes and inclined his head there was something about dumbledore gaze that gave him confidence indeed if harry did not know better he would have said dumbledore was enjoying himself yes sir as is easily established through bloodlines and family history the malfoy family as one of the oldest and purest lines in the wizarding world and is hence considered a noble wizarding family lord malfoy has requested that this court charge mr potter with the crime of depriving him and his family of a valued piece of property and servant further lord malfoy asserts that mr potter has made allegations slander since the end of last school term that lord malfoy is a death eater have you done this mr potter again dumbledore gave him the go ahead yes sir it is harry was going to say the truth but he did not get the chance see the boy admits to both violations of the statute it is now up to this court to decide the monetary penalty that should be applied to mr potter and transferred to lord malfoy fudge said exultingly harry found the idea of him paying money to the malfoy nauseating the court erupted as the members began talking to each other finally madam bones silenced them order i call this court to order general statute 132 is very old she looked down and consulted a book but minister fudge has described it adequately and it does still seem to be in force dumbledore stood if harry had thought dumbledore had radiated a vast amount of power before it was nothing compared to the power dumbledore radiated now how powerful is dumbledore he wondered in awe madam bones harry was impressed the woman did not flinch from dumbledore voice is it true that the statute 132 can also be solved with a duel the woman looked down at the book again and nodded when was the last time the wizengamot has dealt with his particular statute madam bones swallowed the year 1787 am i also correct in asserting that any noblewizard may challenge another to a duel when he interprets that his honor has been slandered questioned dumbledore that is correct said madam bones her monocle was in danger of disappearing as she looked penetratingly at dumbledore recognition then dawned on her face and the corners of her mouth twitch so briefly that harry thought he must have been mistaken very good said dumbledore and somehow he seemed to grow taller and even more intimidating most of the wizengamot had now pushed their chairs back as far as they would go and the reporters in the viewing stand had all vacated the closest rows to those in the far back cornelius fudge the very air vibrated as dumbledore spoke the minister name you have slandered my name and accused me of lying i challenge you to a duel all blood drained from fudge face and his head turned from left to right looking for help the man expression reminded harry of how wormtail had looked when he had first confronted sirius and remus he was completely and utterly terrified i demand you rise now fudge roared dumbledore who now seemed to glow with power minutes seemed to pass as fudge visibly gulped for air and confidence he did try to stand but his knees refused to support his weight d dumbledore su sur surely we we donthave to d d due duel he pleaded for months you have insisted that lord voldemort almost everyone in the room flinched at the name has not returned effectively calling both myself and harry potter liars you have made insinuations that i am unstable for trusting mr potter word insulting me why should i not challenge you to a duel this statute is in effect is it not harry watched as the words sunk in fudge squirmed and his eyes were wide he was close to panicking in effect the question came out as a squeak yes minister fudge due to the statute s madam bones paused briefly antiquity and lack of application for over 200 years it is possible for the current minister of magic to declare it void and have it stricken from the record madam bones said formally harry got the distinct impression she was enjoying fudge predicament dumbledore allowed his cloak to part so that his wand was visible fudge eyes locked onto it as dumbledore hand began to lower toward the wand fudge eyes grew wider with every inch dumbledore hand lowered stop screamed fudge his voice very high i i i declare the statue i mean the statute stricken then the charge against harry dumbledore raised his eyebrows and did not finish his sentence he waited calmly for fudge to finish it before him is dismissed of course said fudge no cried dolores umbridge who had at long last found her voice i propose the court consider statute 1034 the boy is trying to cause a panic with his continued assertion that he who must not be named has returned the statute clearly states that while it is illegal to cause a panic the accused must have the intention of causing a panic mr potter and i have no such intentions we only seek to see the wizarding world prepare itself for lord voldemort has returned retorted dumbledore perhaps misinterpreting the wizengamot members horror struck faces umbridge said i call for an immediate vote relief flooded harry as only five members raised their hands in favor of conviction he knew he should not have been worried but he could not help it madam bones then called for silence mr harry potter this session of the wizengamot herby finds you innocent and asks your forgiveness for wasting your time you are free to go the wizengamot members began filing out a few nodded to dumbledore as they passed umbridge sneered as she walked by muttering about this isntthe end finally fudge was walked out by percy who was supporting most of the minister weight dumbledore chuckled and then said good day minister fudge jumped slightly but continued walking mr weasley met them at the door wringing his hands how d it go i innocent proclaimed harry yes but let us leave unless you want to answer questions from those reporters dumbledore eyes were twinkling merrily harry looked behind him to find the reporters who had witnessed the trial starting to file out in his direction remembering rita skeeter harry began walking toward the elevator without saying a word mr weasley and professor dumbledore following in his wake albus dumbledore and harry mr weasley had remained at his office returned to grimmauld place to find a party already started ginny had informed everyone that harry had gotten off the twins had lit several fireworks of their own invention harry and dumbledore entered at precisely the right moment to catch mrs weasley pointing her wand at one and saying evanesco fred and george had both yelled at the same time no but it was too late where there had been one large pinwheel there were now two mrs weasley who had not yet seen harry rounded on the twins fred seeing his mother taking a deep breath before what would no doubt be a very long yelling said loudly hiya harry mrs weasley turned her attention away from the very relieved twins to harry she enveloped him in a crushing hug oh harry we knew they couldntconvict you how could they she let go of harry and for one moment he thought she was going to hug dumbledore too but she settled for giving him a large smile ginny said you were brilliant albus dumbledore smiled it was rather fun too he made sure harry and ginny were within earshot before continuing but we all must remember this is not the end i believe minister fudge and madam umbridge will attempt to exploit the situation his words cast a damper on the party and hermione immediately asked how can they do that they lost dumbledore genial smile changed to an ironic smile never underestimate the combined power of fools and the media a n hope everyone had an enjoyable holiday happy new year sorry about the time it took to update but life got a lot more hectic for me during the holidays i post review responses on a bulletin board the link is in my profile i expect to have chapter 22 out within the week this is the chapter many of you have been waiting for sirius fate twenty two should finish out ootp there have been a couple questions about hbp and canon once ootp is over i will only be using hbp as inspiration what happened in hbp is not canon as far as this story goes this will prove especially true with how the horcruxes are explained the change will be very evident disclaimer duh like not mine chapter 21 consequences of news dumbledore words were prophetic the day before the quartet was due to return to hogwarts the daily prophet published an article describing the trial instead of portraying the charges as frivolous the paper focused on how harry potter with the aid of the increasingly senile albus dumbledore had the charges dismissed on technicalities surprisingly the next day revealed that it was not harry who was taking the brunt of the paper criticism but dumbledore the editors were now calling for his removal citing his support for harry and his attempt to challenge fudge to a duel as evidence of his unstable behavior harry threw the paper on the floor of the floor of the compartment disgusted with it ginny leaned against him and he wrapped his arms around her people arent going to believe this rubbish proclaimed ron everyone but hermione looked at ron in disbelief hermione was staring at the paper she tore her gaze from the paper and looked at harry then at ron and then back at the paper i ve got an idea she exclaimed loudly can i use hedwig harry nodded and ginny opened hedwig cage hermione was already writing furiously no one had even seen where she had gotten the quill and parchment hermione what are you doing ventured ron hermione gestured for him to be quiet and kept on writing finally she finished and attached the letter quickly to hedwig leg the owl looked at the open window and seemed to sigh before launching herself into the train slipstream what was that about pressed ron now that she had finished maybe nothing but you ll find out if it works out replied hermione ron frowned tell us you dontneed to keep secrets keep secrets that rich coming from you hermione quarreled back ginny stood and mentally sent as she left the compartment i ve got something to talk about with fred and george harry nodded and decided that it was a good time to use the loo he suspected ron and hermione would be bickering for at least a good ten minutes he took extra time to wash his hands indeed he had washed them three times before exiting the loo sadly harry did not think it was enough time for hermione and ron to finish their argument the corridor was empty and harry began walking slowly back to his compartment hoping to stall long enough for them to finish their quarrelling a cold drawling voice caused him to pause malfoy was talking not a spectacularly unusual thing in itself but his words made up for it yes father said that it wontbe long now not after perfect potter trial malfoy said it was followed by a voice too low to decipher which could have been either crabbe or goyle when that happens then we ll have run of the school we ll make them pay all of them potter and the mudbloods harry edged past the compartment quietly not wanting to alert malfoy he had been there he then quickly made his way back to the compartment all the while thinking that it was definitely time to focus his attention on malfoy leave him to me came ginny voice i just need to iron out a few details her attention returned to the twins harry smiled as an image formed in his head of what ginny had planned his smile turned wicked i ve got an addition as he approached the compartment that ron and hermione were still in his smile faded as he heard loud voices escaping the closed door you have the emotional range of a teaspoon yelled hermione this seems remarkably familiar thought harry what that supposed to mean was ron response harry took a deep breath and opened the compartment will you two stop fighting you re going to drive me barmy both ron and hermione jumped and blushed in embarrassment sorry mumbled ron although it was unclear to whom he was apologizing an uncomfortable silence settled over the compartment until hermione broke it can i help you with your animagus transformation ron i want to learn as much as i can about the process so that it does not take me long after i finish my potion asked hermione ron looked surprise and a tad fearful but he responded affirmatively anyway yeah that would be a great help a week later ron was probably regretting his decision to allow hermione to help him while harry and ginny were pleased with hermione taking the lead as they had grown rather frustrated with ron lack of progress ron now had precious little free time as hermione had expanded the original weekly animagus sessions to daily lessons ron had complained that he did not have the time since he would also have homework and quidditch practice hermione however only took that as a challenge and had drawn up a schedule that allowed him to do everything that is so long as he did not procrastinate consequently ron spent most of the first week being hounded by hermione privately harry thought that ron marks were going to improve if hermione was able to keep him on the schedule even for only a few weeks the fallout from the trial and his portrayal in the papers meant that most of hogwarts population was back to whispering and pointing whenever harry drew near however by the end of the second week of classes most people had stopped pointing and whispering when harry was in view or more accurately when ginny was in view with him after one sixth year and two fourth years had fled in terror with bat bogeys clawing their faces everyone else became remarkably polite if the students were now being polite umbridge had reached unparallel levels of vindictiveness harry had asked for more of the twins toad powder they had promised to make some but had said they had several other products they were working on for their joke shop it seemed the twins had taken advantage of the two weeks without hermione either scaring off customers or seizing their products is there any way for her to spend more time with ron pleaded george with hermione spending so much time ensuring ron complied with her schedule she had little time to harass the twins about their less than safe products we ve made nearly fifty galleons added fred dontworry we ll start on the powder my boy but we re doing all we can to keep up with demand and still keep inventing george winked at him before saying besides ginny has us working on her special project you wouldntbelieve how hard it is to mix a permanent sticking charm and a summoning charm together correctly harry thoughts moved from umbridge to malfoy do you think you could add a shrinking charm the twins frowned in unison while their eyes glinted in understanding it possible but started fred but it will take us longer george paused considering another week or so probably we can probably have it for you in three weeks you know umbridge banning them from quidditch was probably her worst move noted ginny who was serving detention how do you figure that harry was still more than a little bitter over the ban now fred and george donthave anything better to do other than invent jokes and pranks could you imagine what they would be like if they werent afraid of being expelled harry smirked considering it you mean they are afraid of being expelled actually i think they re more afraid of what mum would do to them you ve heard them talking they already have premises in diagon alley they are just here to appease mum your mum is scary teased harry you know it replied a serious ginny harry peaked over his shoulder filch was looking in the other direction but mrs norris was watching him from behind filch leg smirking evilly harry wrapped his nails on the cold hard stone that filch was making him scrub mrs norris eyes grew wide and after a few unsuccessful attempts to gain traction with her nails practically flew in the opposite direction at least i get some satisfaction out of this umbridge had given him detention for looking at her in a malicious manner harry had not even been looking at the evil toad at all he had been absently staring out the window but ginny had and umbridge was still tentative about punishing her so she usually gave harry the detentions that she would have normally given ginny rolling his eyes harry returned to the floor he scrubbed it slowly as it did not matter how much of the stupid floor he actually cleaned umbridge detention was supposed to last all day not just the night so harry found himself after lunch on a friday no less scrubbing until it was time for care of magical creatures several loud thumps and a high pitched scream drew both his and filch attention filch rushed toward the great hall followed closely by harry in the middle of the great hall was professor trelawney two trunks were at the bottom of the stairs which they had obviously fallen down trelawney was swinging her arms widely and held a bottle in one hand umbridge was at the top of the stairs looking down malevolently at the professor professor mcgonagall rushed over to trelawney and placed an arm around the woman shoulders while her other hand removed the bottle from trelawney grasp it alright sybil you ll be able to stay hogwarts is your home harry watched the proceedings in shock he was not sure what was happening but it looked like trelawney had been sacked he had also never seen mcgonagall ever be this civil with the divination professor the only time he had seen them interact at all was during the christmas dinner during his third year he had gotten the impression then that the two professors did not interact or care for each other sybil trelawney is no longer a teacher here at hogwarts she will not be staying said umbridge in a loud clear voice trelawney let out cry of anguish that was half anger and half sobbing actually ms trelawney can stay at hogwarts as long as she desires announced a voice from the vicinity of the doors leading into the great hall dumbledore stood framed in the doorway he made an impressive image with the sun high behind him causing a halo like effect around his body wh what croaked umbridge as headmaster of hogwarts i may grant anyone shelter here responded dumbledore calmly mcgonagall took this as all the authority she needed to quietly lead trelawney out of the great hall and back toward her rooms the comment angered umbridge causing a livid flush to rise from her neck then acting in my position as hogwarts high inquisitor i hereby appoint please madam do not be hasty dumbledore voice was still stately and calm but there was no mistaking the steel behind it i have already found a replacement for ms trelawney then she cannot stay the new professor will need her space announced umbridge victoriously again you are being overly hasty firenze will not require ms trelawney spaces a classroom on the ground floor is far more preferable to him said dumbledore firenze the centaur walked in gracefully his hooves echoing on the stone floor umbridge paled either in indignation or disgust the next day a new educational decree was issued declaring the ministry had the power to appoint or dismiss the headmaster of hogwarts with the consent of the majority of the wizengamot and the hogwarts board of governors the decree had caused a great deal of commotion and gossip among both the teachers and the students during breakfast malfoy had snidely said as harry passed just wait potter soon dumbledore wontbe able to protect you harry had nearly hexed malfoy on the spot but ginny had grabbed his wrist and forced them to keep walking how can you just ignore him demanded harry too irritated to think properly ignore him please dontworry he ll get what coming to him you know that besides if you do anything in the great hall you ll only end up in detention again it would be worth it harry grumbled as he sat down at the table yes but it is even better to make a fool out of malfoy and get away with it dontyou think so ginny gave her patented mischievous smile as she began piling food onto her plate harry looked over at the slytherin table before replying i suppose but i going to ask fred and george to hurry i ve been doing some research and i think i can add the summoning charm and shrinking charm myself i just need them to finish with the goo dumbledore surveyed the house tables with some amusement at the sheer amount of commotion the educational decree had caused his eyes twinkled brightly at the smiles harry and ginny shared if he was not mistaken the school was in for a show soon he wondered if whatever those two had planned would be sufficient for the ministry to try and dismiss him dumbledore smirked if whatever they had planned did not do it then he was sure that eventually one of the weasley twins products would the ministry had unwittingly played directly into his hands he had expected that it would have taken fudge a much longer amount of time to convince both the wizengamot and the board of governors to allow this particular decree the press coverage had probably added weight to his request dumbledore mused dumbledore needed to leave hogwarts without raising suspicion as to why he was leaving there were many things to do things he had put off for too long frowning dumbledore chided himself he should have done this almost three years ago it was such a simple task really but dumbledore was afraid he would find proof that would validate his suspicions if he found what he was looking for then there was the matter of testing his theory dumbledore felt a chill run down his spine he would have to make sure severus had a strong healing potion ready just in case harry and ginny watched the entrance to the great hall with great anticipation despite getting to bed very late not only had there been a d a meeting last night but they had put the finishing touches on their prank they had arisen extremely early in order to ensure they managed to get prime seats for the spectacle that would happen fred and george had been quite disappointed when they entered the great hall to find all the seats with a view of the entrance already taken neither had said anything as they had immediately turned around and walked out of the hall no one noticed two pairs of small beady weasel eyes from underneath a large display case five minutes later draco malfoy walked through the entrance way and stopped what the malfoy exclaimed as he pulled on his right foot and then his left trying to get them off the floor his exclamation drew the attention of most of the hall precisely two seconds later the summoning charm activated and forcefully summoned every article of clothing that he wore to the floor while the summoning charm had been ripping malfoy clothes off his body the targeted shrinking charm had also activated the great hall which had at first been laughing at malfoy inability to move went deathly silent then a girl from ravenclaw neither harry nor ginny knew who called out loudly malfoy you blush all over the great hall exploded into laughter which only caused malfoy large blush to deepen adding fuel to the fire several students were now commenting on malfoy shortcomings it took five minutes for snape to free him from his predicament harry was just returning to his meal when he heard a hufflepuff behind him say and to think i fancied him he not really much to look at without his fancy robes the remark sent the gryffindor table into another gale of laughter oh yes today is going to be a good day said harry to no one in particular you just dont know how good fred and george will have some more of the toad powder ready by the end of the week sent ginny as she smiled at him pity they think she building up a tolerance to it for the rest of the day and except for classes the next day malfoy kept to the slytherin dormitory umbridge however was in a disturbingly good mood her mood lasted for the rest of the week and by friday harry was becoming very concerned umbridge being happy only worried him slightly less than voldemort being happy he looked at snape and breathed a sigh of relief at least that slimy git wasnt happy harry was sure that that would be a tell tale sign of the apocalypse what with umbridge he questioned over the breakfast table ron gave him a perplexed expression before glancing at the professor table and then shrugging hermione however frowned it cantbe anything good ginny only smiled wickedly and thought she wontbe smiling after dinner tonight harry gave her a smile umbridge was going to spend some quality time as a toad soon hermione had just closed her mouth when a large barn owl dropped a letter in harry lap his name was written in large loopy handwriting unsealing the parchment he found the letter was from dumbledore requesting that he come to the headmaster office after classes all through classes there was a strange atmosphere of foreboding after dinner harry left for dumbledore office while ginny and the others went to the room of requirement for a d a session when he arrived at the gargoyle that guarded dumbledore office he stopped realizing that dumbledore had not given him the password er ice mice acid pops pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes harry was getting frustrated will you just move he pleaded with the indifferent gargoyle chocolate frogs lemon drops peppermint toads cockroach clusters fudge flies the gargoyle sprang to the side you have got to be kidding fudge flies harry shook his head and started up the spiral stairway leading to dumbledore office when he reached dumbledore closed door he raised his fist to knock but was stopped by dumbledore voice please come in harry dumbledore was seated behind his desk in his usual pose of steepled hands and benevolent smile his eyes were twinkling madly far more than usual harry noted it was similar to the expression the headmaster had worn at the trial sir you wanted to see me he stuffed his hands into his pockets absently and began rolling the bag of toad powder in his pocket i did i fear changes temporary changes are coming to hogwarts there are things i want to inform you of before i am indisposed concluded dumbledore first you must trust professor snape harry opened his mouth to protest i understand what it must look like to you and professor snape has hardly cultivated a better image of himself but you can indeed you must trust him harry nodded his understanding he was not going to be able to change dumbledore mind about snape but he did not care what dumbledore said snape was a death eater secondly you must be on your guard lord voldemort is after two things right now you and the prophecy if you have any visions or surges of feelings from voldemort go to one of the members of the order of the phoenix they will know what to do dumbledore looked down at his complicated watch and frowned hmmm i had hoped for more time we will talk again after i have settled matters with the ministry almost at the same moment dumbledore had finished speaking a loud knocking reverberated from closed door several muffled voices could be heard through the door although their voices were indiscernible their tones clearly said those outside were not happy dumbledore waved his hand and the door creaked open on the other side of the door stood an extremely irate professor mcgonagall harry took an instinctual step backwards it was never a good sign when the stern professor lips became thin but now they had practically disappeared to be replaced by two almost nonexistent lines behind mcgonagall looking flustered but determined was professor umbridge minister fudge and two other wizards when the five entered the office harry recognized kingsley shacklebolt as one of the men with fudge the auror gave his head a nearly imperceptible shake to warn harry off from recognizing him harry shifted to the side so that he was facing the newcomers and his back was to dumbledore who was now standing to his left minister fudge professor umbridge aurors shacklebolt and dawlish how good to see you is there something i can do for you nothing in dumbledore tone suggested that he was anything but pleased at their presence minister fudge gave a slight huff puffed himself up and took a step forward when he did harry noticed a sixth individual percy weasley percy gave him the smallest of awkward smiles which was strange for percy harry could hardly ever remember him smiling at all and most of those were because of his prefect or head boy badges percy embarrassed announced ginny who was at the d a meeting percy only smiles when he embarrassed i wonder if ouch what the bloo bates mocos harry shivered in sympathy for the unfortunate colin who had just been subjugated to ginny notorious bat bogey hex he had been partnering ginny at the meeting and had hexed her while she was concentrating on harry yes professor dumbledore we are here to remove you from the position of headmaster of hogwarts fudge gleefully proclaimed dumbledore eyes increased their twinkling and he asked really minister on what grounds fudge jubilant face did not waver you are under investigation for your inability to ensure the safety of your teachers and students aurors take him into custody pending hearing the grin on his face could not have been larger since when dumbledore asked simply still maintaining his clam demeanor mcgonagall however was turning an alarming shade of red since when echoed fudge seeming to lose track of what he was saying as dumbledore peered directly into his eyes since the beginning of this school year said umbridge taking over for fudge the pranks that have been pulled have been absolutely reckless and dangerous why just recently young mr malfoy was stripped in front of the entire school ah yes backed up fudge then there is the matter of turning professors into animals human transfiguration is incredibly dangerous and cannot be allowed to continue harry stopped fiddling with the bag of powder in his pocket and did his best to look innocent the corners of mcgonagall mouth moved ever so slightly and dumbledore beard twitched you are planning on taking me into custody because of pranks asked dumbledore serenely and with a trace of underlying humor there is no planning about it we have the approval of both the wizengamot and the board of governors so let finish this come on dumbledore let go said fudge waving his hand to the door the minister obviously did not expect dumbledore to resist this is outrageous interrupted mcgonagall she was about to continue when dumbledore held up his hand i quite agree minerva and i regret to inform you cornelius that i will not be accompanying you fudge paled at the statement umbridge smiled wickedly and the two aurors shifted uncomfortably what do you mean wheezed fudge his eyes now locked on dumbledore wand hand it is very simple minister i will not be accompanying you willingly or otherwise dumbledore eyes shifted to the auror on fudge right i would not do that if i were you dawlish as i recall while your defense against the dark arts marks were always more than satisfactory you were always slow on the draw dumbledore eyes hardened and the room filled with charged energy i am not the auror hand which had been moving toward his wand stopped in mid gesture and he turned to look at fudge whose previously pale expression was now grey mcgonagall moved toward her own wand at this point this too dumbledore saw dontminerva i need you here at hogwarts with the students the aged professor looked like she wanted to protest but put her drawn wand back she a quick draw thought harry looking at the professor with even more respect than usual remind me never to cross mcgonagall agreed ginny her voice was then followed by a feeling of pain probably from a stinging hex which was quickly followed by colin if you hex me one more time i going to shove your camera harry shook his head to clear the echoes of ginny screaming and returned his focus on the minister fudge opened his mouth and uttered a few unintelligible words umbridge took one disgusted look at him and entered the fray enough of this aurors take him into custody dumbledore was a quick draw harry was not sure if the headmaster had sent one or ten spells but he had done it all without saying a word within a span of no more than a few seconds fudge umbridge percy and the aurors were all lying unconscious on the floor it appears we have run out of time minerva harry i will be in touch as soon as i can dumbledore said as he kneeled down and checked the prone victims it is a pity that i had to hex kingsley but it would have been suspicious if i had not please apologize to him when you can he said addressing mcgonagall who nodded curtly dumbledore then turned to a still stunned harry who was wondering how he was going to manage at a hogwarts that was ruled by umbridge dontworry too much soon fudge will rue the day he dislodged me from hogwarts with twinkling eyes he then added i trust that madam umbridge will not find hogwarts very peaceful at that harry smiled remembering the powder in this pocket which he then took out very carefully he spread some of the fine particles around umbridge hands so that when she moved to push herself off the ground she would have to touch some of it no sir i dontthink hogwarts will be very peaceful at all for the first time in harry life he saw mcgonagall give a full unrestrained smile peering at the powder dumbledore answered no i dontthink so either remember if you need help talk to professor mcgonagall or one of the other members of the order of the phoenix he looked down at his watch again and then said i must go they will wake soon fawkes are you ready for a journey old friend the phoenix gave a positive sounding trill and wiggled his tail feathers in a flash of fire phoenix and professor were gone dumbledore gave a small cough and then sneezed everything in the cottage was covered in layers of dust he had not visited the cottage in almost five decades it held many memories too many memories none of the memories were bad but they were painful the professor now looking his age gave a reluctant wave of his wand the layers of dust disappeared the cottage had several articles and perhaps most of all one book that he needed he had acquired the book from grindlewald personal library and not even the ministry of magic had a copy it was terribly old and described only the vilest of the dark arts most of which had been forgotten over the passage of time heaving a great sigh dumbledore removed the book from its shelf a shelf that he had placed under the fidelius charm so many years ago he opened the book to the appropriate page and goosebumps rose on his flesh at the top of the page was the heading fissionem anima ars horcrux snapping the book shut dumbledore face hardened and he disapparated without a sound it was time to go hunting harry had not even made it back to the common room before he was being pelted with questions about what had happened in dumbledore office the hogwarts rumor mill had rushed into high gear and it seemed the entire castle was abuzz with talk about dumbledore removal get back now pleaded ginny they are going to drive me nuts harry ignored the questions being yelled at him by a few ravenclaws and continued on his way to gryffindor tower hermione and ron were harassing ginny for information tell us what happened hissed hermione in ginny ear is dumbledore really gone asked ron who was sitting on her other side ginny shoved her brother away from her ear stood and then rounded on the two older students i dontknow i was too busy getting hexed by colin ginny felt a tad of shame rise up as she remembered that colin was still in the hospital wing to pay close attention to what happened in dumbledore office hermione however was undaunted and then demanded in a barely audible voice why dont you just ask harry now before ginny could retort to hermione the twins took up positions on either side of her so little ginnikins started george what the news finished fred ginny shot the twin on her right george a disgusted look george took a step back but fred pressed the issue donttell us you dontknow little gin gin we know for a fact that you know everything that happens around dear little harrikins i going to kill dumbledore for telling you muttered ginny why dontyou ask him yourself she said as harry opened the portrait hole the rush by ron hermione and the twins to get to him aroused the attention of the other gryffindors in the room who also rushed toward him eager to hear if the rumors were true thanks ginny did you really curse the minister of magic squealed a first year is dumbledore gone asked several voices did umbridge really turn into a toad again harry was only able to escape to his dormitory after he had given his recount of had happened in dumbledore office three times luckily no one had questioned why harry had been in dumbledore office when he made it to his bed he deftly drew the curtains reached under his pillow and drew out the mirror sirius had given him good idea intoned ginny sirius sirius are you there harry spoke into the mirror the mirror surface turned black like the surface of a lake at night small ripples could be seen before sirius face appeared harry how are you doing sirius asked his appearance looked better than it had before christmas but sirius looked like he had not shaved for a couple of days dumbledore just left he hexed fudge umbridge and some aurors gushed harry sirius face turned very serious slow down harry tell me what happened for the fourth time that night harry related the tale dumbledore has been expecting something like this ever since your trial he knew fudge or maybe it more due to umbridge would want to gain control of hogwarts responded sirius what so important about hogwarts asked ginny what so important about hogwarts echoed harry a brief expression of amusement crossed sirius face fudge thinks dumbledore is trying to build an army you should have seen some of the reports we got after umbridge found out about your dada club sirius stopped talking to chuckle it confirmed their worst fears then it our fault that dumbledore gone harry said dejectedly nonsense retorted sirius it only an excuse besides dumbledore has been trying to find a way to spend time away from hogwarts without suspicion he wonttell anyone what he wants to do he been very coy about it seeing harry still looked ashamed sirius went on look at it this way wait is ginny listening harry nodded good think of it like this you now have carte blanche to make hogwarts a personal hell for umbridge imagine the pranks you could pull if you didnthave to worry about getting expelled sirius said his face gaining a dreamy look obviously thinking about how the marauders would have handled the situation he right and dumbledore did imply oh this is going to be so much fun as ginny talked several images of umbridge in peculiar and dangerous situations passed through harry mind shaking his head to clear it harry asked has dumbledore come there yet harry imagined that grimmauld place would be the natural first place for dumbledore to go to no in fact dumbledore has been about far less than i expected him to be since we had our last meeting sirius said and then took on a dejected tone not that i can blame him this place is awful a lot better since dobby and winky cleaned up a bit but it going to take a long time to rub out the evil that used to be here sirius shrugged at his predicament making his head in the mirror bob up and down but the house is getting better kreacher is getting better he is still foul just not as evil harry felt sorry for his godfather he knew that he would not like to be cooped up in a dingy house with a crazy house elf as his only company are there any other order member about he asked hopefully only dung is around a lot he an okay chap but not terribly good for coherent conversation sirius said with a smirk moony stops by when he can but dumbledore has him out most of the time talking to other magical creatures or doing research right now it just me and wherever kreacher has gotten off to oh sorry sirius face smirked at him dontfeel too bad you re the one who has to study you ve got your o w l s soon so besides pranking umbridge and slytherins i want you to keep your mind on your studies and not on pretty little redheads harry face blushed crimson at the suggestive tone of sirius voice barking a laugh sirius added merlin i cantbelieve it i sound like lily james you should study more and prank less sirius laughed again i mean it though dontfollow fred and george example those two are brilliant but they really did have horrid o w l scores sirius shivered harry did not think the twins marks had been that bad but then sirius continued you should hear molly talk about it you really are brave if ginny gets half as mad as molly does wow he seemed to give a small shiver at the thought this time it was harry who laughed sirius face turned serious again harry there something you need to know now that dumbledore gone it probably wontaffect you but you should know just in case sirius head pivoted as he looked around evidently checking to make sure no one could hear him despite the fact he was the only one there a group of death eaters escaped from azkaban some time ago the ministry has kept it under wraps but it wontkeep for too much longer harry felt chills go down his spine in her own dormitory ginny sat up straight on her bed who asked harry the three lestranges antonin dolohov and augustus rockwood are the ones i know but there are seven in all sirius spat out you should also warn the longbottom boy he deserves to know the lestranges are out after what they did to his parents from the expression on sirius face harry was not sure he wanted to know but he asked anyway what happened sirius gave a great sigh and the image in the mirror jiggled as he moved to a different position not too long after voldemort disappeared a group of death eaters the three lestranges and barty crouch jr captured the longbottoms they were both excellent well respected aurors sirius sighed heavily before continuing and the death eaters tortured them into insanity trying to find voldemort hiding place they are both living in st mungo s if you can call it that he finished sadly and with bitterness harry and sirius said their good byes before harry stuffed the mirror back under his pillow and took a few deep breaths it was beginning he knew it voldemort now had his most faithful followers the wizarding world was at war and it did not even know it damn fudge when do you want to tell everyone asked ginny might as well do it now grab hermione and i ll get ron and neville ron and neville were just getting ready for bed when harry emerged from his curtained bed ron neville we need to talk come on it must have been something in harry tone that compelled both boys to look immediately worried they followed without a word ginny and hermione were waiting downstairs in the common room most of their fellow gryffindors had already retired for the night but there were a few still up dean and seamus were playing a game of exploding snap parvati and lavender were in a corner giggling and colin was sitting at the largest table which he had spread photos out on harry felt a pang of jealousy watching them they had no idea of the threat that was building let go harry ginny said quietly she placed her hand on his elbow and guided him out of the common room ten minutes later harry closed the door to the room of requirement i ve got some news he said simply just after term started there was a mass breakout from azkaban seven death eaters escaped why hasntit been in the paper asked hermione who questioned neville who looked out of place i only know five of their names rockwood dolohov and the three lestranges answered harry neville grew very pale a a all three of them harry nodded neville sat heavily in one of the chairs provided by the room ron broke the intervening silence it really has begun again hasntit mum and dad told us some stories about what it was like during the war you couldnttrust anyone and people were dying everyday mum lost her two brothers harry looked up at that moody said they died like heroes that it took five death eaters to kill them ron smiled sadly proud that his uncles had acquitted themselves well will he attack hogwarts now all the books i ve read said that he didntlast time because dumbledore was here what to stop him now that dumbledore gone asked hermione and then her eyes widened in obvious horror what am i going to tell my parents ron gave her an incredulous look the two had been spending a lot of time together since ron was surprisingly still following hermione schedule why does telling your parents about you know who being back frighten you more than him attacking hogwarts hermione cast him a sidelong glance and began to respond when ron cut her off you did tell them about you know who returning last year hermione blushed deeply ron only shook his head that was rather perceptive of ron said ginny in disbelief he has been spending a lot of time with her you dontthink that they well um are going out now do you asked harry tentatively please between the two of them one of them would let something slip when they were fighting i dontthink they even realize they like each other yet well hermione might know she likes ron but ron well ron a bit thick he really does have the emotional range of a teaspoon harry coughed to cover the laugh that threaten burst out neville moved slightly and then said something that could not be heard hermione grateful for the shift of attention asked him what did you say neville why did you tell me he asked from the look on his face he was afraid of the answer harry cast a pleading look at ron and hermione hoping they would not press the issue i know what happened neville seemed to collapse into himself okay thanks for telling me he said in a whisper and then louder i mean it thanks he then very slowly at first proceeded to tell them what had happened to his parents sirius guess that the story was going to break soon was accurate the two days later the daily prophet front page story was the mass breakout from azkaban included in the story were descriptions of the past crimes each of the seven had done or so hermione told them over breakfast as she had not yet relinquished the paper i cantbelieve them they re making it sound like dumbledore had something to do with the breakout because the ministry tried to arrest him two days ago they donteven say when the breakout occurred how stupid do they think people are everyone knows that dumbledore would never help death eaters she stopped talking and was now staring at the story with a very intense look i ve got it she exclaimed everyone exchanged confused looks and waited for hermione to explain she did not instead she stood handed the paper to harry and then said i need to send an owl she then scurried off out of the great hall why cantshe just take a minute to explain asked a very exasperated ron ginny took the paper from harry unresisting hands and began scanning the story oh neville i so sorry she handed the paper to neville who looked down at the story and quickly found the headline that read frank and alice longbottom neville was not the only one to receive additional attention thanks to the article several other family names had been mentioned in the article by the end of the day susan bones whose uncles had been killed by death eaters had told harry that she now knew what it felt like to be him the repercussions for harry were surprisingly positive people were now considering that he was telling that truth the death eaters escape from azkaban gave hogwarts an oppressive and dark atmosphere without dumbledore presence everyone seemed edgy and less confident of their safety the twins had noticed the changed atmosphere too the place needs something to liven it up they had confided in harry he could not wait until whatever the twins had planned came to fruition b n phoenixaeternum asked me to make a note that any faults with the latin are his i say no worries it gets the job done a n chapter 23 as promised it just over 9000 words but it ends ootp hallelujah i not entirely pleased with the chapter not that i ever am the action scenes were difficult to write but after giving it a once over it not as bad as i thought this chapter like the previous has only been looked one time so expect some errors tried to correct the obvious there something else i wanted to say but i cantremember what it was ah yes i have no idea where the scene with the sorting hat came from it just happened well fanfiction seems to be having problems with this chapter i ll try reposting the chapter and hoping for the best without further ado enjoy chapter 23 the second war begins if umbridge had been hoping that things would calm down after the twins left she was wrong now in addition to the seeming ever present poltergeist about half the population of hogwarts was vying for the title left vacant by fred and george troublemakers in chief harry and ginny made good use of the products the twins had left but for the most part concentrated on their studies it was safer that way while the professors were piling on the homework for o w l s hermione study habits and consequently their study habits had risen to new unparalleled levels harry had never missed quidditch as much as he did now as ginny and ron were both at practice three times a week angelina was running the team ragged he spent a great deal of time in the library with hermione hermione was great but if she made him recite another potion recipe he might have to kill her harry could not figure out how ron was doing it though not only was he on the quidditch team however dismally he played but he was also still helping hermione with her potion hermione also still refused to allow him to skive off any of his animagus training sessions he was making progress but it was still slow luckily quidditch was over gryffindor had won the cup but barely if ginny had not been on the team with her firebolt harry thought it would have turned out differently especially since their beaters were horrible and ron had only showed his potential during the last match harry sighed and pushed back from the table at the thought of the match he did not get to watch why why did hagrid have to bring his brother with him he asked rhetorically to ginny hagrid had shown him and hermione grawp during the match when everyone had been preoccupied hagrid was worried that umbridge was going to fire him he seemed resigned to that fact but wanted someone to take care of grawp you mean his little brother ginny replied sarcastically he hagrid what else do you expect he means well and you never know maybe grawp will learn to be good okay maybe not ginny conceded the weekend before o w l s started hermione convinced them to quiz each other with o w l s started the next day hermione had become frantic and had even allowed ron the time off from animagus training to focus on his studies ron used the time for sleeping and eating the study session did not go well the only positive aspect was that they had chosen to do it in the room of requirement rather than the common room after they had quizzed hermione in charms she only missed two questions she had questioned ginny and then harry when neither of them missed a question hermione had grown infuriated are you two sharing answers harry and ginny had looked at each other harry answered hard not to oh this is so unfair well since you two dontneed to study ron let go to the library ron had cast a terrified look over his shoulder as he trudged past them to follow hermione ginny and harry waited in the silence before ginny said i really could have used a review of ancient runes harry nodded and then contributed astronomy and herbology too we could study herbology with neville suggested ginny they immediately left the room to search for neville besides the nerves o w l s turned out to be fairly simple although harry had to admit the toughest for him were still ahead astronomy and ancient runes herbology after studying an afternoon with neville went smoother than he expected and he was confident he had passed it potions had gone remarkably well it helped not to have snape looking over his shoulder it was obvious that hermione was still a little miffed about their ability to share answers not that it helped on the practical when she had caught ginny asking him if he was sure about one of the questions on the written portion of the transfiguration exam astronomy well i ve got the moon position remarked harry as he scratched it on the parchment it hard to miss noted ginny i ve got mars harry had just finished writing mars position when movement on the grounds below caught his attention several people were advancing on hagrid hut he only recognized one of them the toad like woman in the rear of the group this cantbe good harry hand unconsciously dipped to his wand and he fingered it as he watched them knock on hagrid door calm down wheezed the old man who had given harry extra points on his dada exam for producing a corporeal patronus harry watched horrified as spell after spell was fired at hagrid luckily the spells did not seem to be having much of an effect on the half giant aside from making him very angry harry had never seen hagrid angry and he never wanted to again when one of the aurors stunned fang hagrid had grabbed him and thrown the man a good twenty feet he had not got up that is enough how dare you came a scottish accented voice harry breathed a sigh of relief mcgonagall would put a stop to this when four stunners hit her in the chest harry was not the only one who cried out you came hagrid booming voice without any of its usual cheer and innocence it was the only word he said as he grabbed the closest two offending wizards and then brought them together hard umbridge was still standing firing spells at the half giant but hagrid paid no attention as he bent down he first checked on mcgonagall evidently making sure she was still breathing and then picked up fang slinging the unconscious dog around his neck before jogging off the resulting uproar did not end until well into the next morning harry did not get to bed until four that morning and slept until lunch history of magic was that afternoon and it was his last exam harry leaned back in his chair he had been done with his history of magic essays or at least the four of the five that he knew now for ten minutes he looked over towards ginny she was already asleep he was getting drowsy as well and was thankful he did not have to stay awake ginny had a knack for remembering goblin names she said that they were funny allowing his eyes to close harry quickly fell asleep voldemort was more than angry he was infuriated the entire year he had been trying to get the prophecy and nothing had worked for the past month he had had his most intelligent death eaters trying to find a way to remove the prophecy without him or potter physically doing it and they had produced nothing voldemort looked around but saw nothing he was fuming lucius he called out ye yes my lord said the man to voldemort right do you have anything to report he could see lucius eyes dart side to side in panic through the mask eyeholes no my lord the man now seemed resigned to being tortured no one can remove the prophecy rockwood says that the shelves are heavily charmed voldemort smiled maliciously then bring me the entire shelf it was not a yell but every death eater heard the command aaagh harry woke with a start both of his hands clutching his scar ginny was next to him in a flash her eyes blinking the sleep out of them the old examiner tofty hobbled over to him are you all right my boy i just need some air harry choked out i ll take him outside volunteered ginny are you sure you cantcome back in if you leave you still have some time to double check your answers he asked kindly it alright we re both done said ginny as she led harry out the doors voldemort she asked yeah he going after the prophecy they re going to take the entire shelf to him explained harry is that possible i dontknow maybe hermione harry mate are you all right asked ron as he and hermione emerged through the doors let talk somewhere else ginny said they were soon outside in the sun under a tree with the lake visible in the distance what happened asked hermione death eaters are going to the ministry to steal er something harry finished lamely he had not told ron or hermione about the prophecy something asked a suspicious hermione both he and ginny silently groaned hermione could be very tenacious harry is everything all right asked neville jogging up to them harry did not answer in his frustration but said to no one in particular who do i tell i canttell snape there no one what the matter potter does your head hurt drawled malfoy strutting toward the five of them the slytherin never even took two steps a strange neon blue light struck him and he immediately fell to the ground sleeping the five gryffindors gawked at the sight and then looked for the spell caster luna lovegood walked serenely toward them she stuck her wand in her hair and smiled dreamily at them luna did you began ginny did you hex malfoy asked ron with an awed tone luna looked down at malfoy who was now snoring no ronald i did not hex him what did you do asked hermione i cursed him replied luna flatly harry gave both luna and neville a calculating look ginny explain it to them i going to grimmauld place harry transformed and less than a second later disappeared in a ball of fire did harry just neville said and then shook his head seeing that harry was still gone he started again did harry just turn into a phoenix yes and you need to keep it a secret answered ginny harry flamed into grimmauld place and gave a loud trill before changing into himself sirius remus anyone he yelled the house was eerily silent the silence was broken by a small pop that announced kreacher arrival harry stared at the house elf suspiciously he had never actually seen kreacher ever do magic kreacher where sirius kreacher frowned master is not here where is he asked harry annoyed he looked around the living room and felt another of his hopes fade on the coffee table was sirius mirror not here replied kreacher with a mutinous tone tell me where he is commanded harry though he was surprised by even the marginally civil tone kreacher was using master is not here kreacher does not know where master is master left with the werewolf harry blinked in surprise he had not expected kreacher to actually tell him anything is there anyone else here asked harry with little hope kreacher shook his head side to side making his ears flop thanks harry said before rapidly transforming and flaming to the next location where order members might be the burrow he knew immediately that there was no one at the burrow when he flamed in but he still yelled a couple times before flaming back to hogwarts i couldntfind anyone i checked headquarters and the burrow complained harry you have to tell snape said hermione tell him what asked a confused neville i not telling him anything asserted harry dumbledore might trust snape but he and ginny did not there has got to be someone else added ginny as she wracked her mind for another possibility crookshanks chose that time to run by chasing a small animal i ve got it announced harry mrs figg of course she ll probably know how to contact dumbledore ginny said harry smiled transformed quickly and flamed to wisteria walk several cats and more than a few kneazles greeted him he knocked on mrs figg door and hoped she was home the door opened and revealed the batty mrs figg harry what are you doing here i need to contact professor dumbledore harry said in a whisper now that he was back in the muggle world he felt very exposed mrs figg must have felt similarly come in come in dear sit would you care for a cup of tea no i need to speak to dumbledore said harry again i can try to contact him but there no set procedure when your not here explained a contrite mrs figg what do you need to tell him harry suddenly realized he did not know if mrs figg was part of the order he knew dumbledore had given her the job of watching over him he assumed she was but did she know about the prophecy are you part of the order he asked bluntly mrs figg smiled of course i ve been a member of the order of the phoenix since before you were born now tell me what wrong voldemort has sent his death eaters to the ministry they found a way to remove it without voldemort going himself said harry mrs figg eyes widened and she paled harry did not know if it was because of the implications of what he had said or because of him saying voldemort i ll contact the order oh i hope someone at headquarters harry tried to protest that there was no one at headquarters except a crazy house elf but she waved him off get yourself back to hogwarts i ll handle this do you need to use the floo harry simply transformed and flamed back to hogwarts leaving behind a momentarily stunned mrs figg did you find her asked hermione he did but she just going to contact headquarters ginny answered for harry i going to flame to the ministry i ve wasted enough time harry said with finality harry i not sure that a good idea said ron you cantgo alone i coming with you asserted neville harry looked at him in surprise if it something against v vo vol voldemort i in i want to come too luna chorused no i ll just flame over grab the prophecy and leave said harry with finality what prophecy said four voices at once percy weasley shifted the papers on his desk so that they were neat he checked all his drawers to make sure everything was in its place he smiled sadly as he looked at a set of sealed envelopes soon he told himself i ll be able to tell them soon and if i do it in letter i probably wontget hexed on sight it was unheard of for the ministry to close in the afternoon but those were fudge orders he would have to contact dumbledore when he got back to his flat he had seen lucius in fudge office not too long before he announced the half day dumbledore would want to know that he walked slowly down the hallway which was already dark percy guessed he was one of the last to leave just as he entered the atrium from a side door he saw several figures in dark robes heading toward the elevator percy froze death eaters were in the ministry he quickly moved toward the corridor leading toward the elevator it created a bottleneck and he would be able to hold them off till help arrived if he used the wall for cover it was not until he was in position that he realized he needed to call for help for help to come he looked at the elevator and tried to think what to do he could not allow them to leave he knew the order was guarding something in the department of mysteries and ever since the bode incident he suspected it was a prophecy percy furrowed his brow death eaters could not remove any prophecy they could only be removed by the people the prophecy mentioned the shelves ensured that conceivably you could destroy the shelf but that would also destroy the prophecy the person was after you simply could not get around the protection the shelf provided the shelf the hairs on the back of percy neck stood up and chills went down his spine the shelves they were going to steal the entire damn shelf but they would not be able to fit that into the visitor elevator or one of the floos please no percy thought in prayer if they could not get the shelf out of the ministry then they had to have a way to get the prophecy out of the ministry which meant only one thing to percy you know who percy closed his eyes and slowly stood he had to get a message to dumbledore trying to act natural he turned away from the elevator and began walking back in the direction of his office he had not gone two feet when a high pitched voice interrupted his progress leaving so soon mr weasley you know who was standing in the shadows before him swallowing and licking his lips percy considered his options he could not get to the elevator his office or the floos nor could he apparate if he had been only been closer to the atrium center he could have but here he was well within the wards your dead his logical mind informed him lifting his head in a defiant gesture percy gave the creature a smile now that he knew what was coming he was no longer scared he knew what he had to do dumbledore had to know percy raised his wand quickly and cried expecto patronum voldemort was quick and had cast the killing curse as percy patronus was forming percy flew backwards into the wall sliding down to eventually lie prone on the floor he never got to see the look of surprise and horror on voldemort face as the silver peacock raced past the dark lord harry transformed back into himself and looked around he was a row off and stealthily made his way towards the proper shelf arguing voices made him stop and then slowly peak around the corner a dozen death eaters were standing around the shelf this thing is heavy complained one this is stupid said a feminine voice that made harry shiver mobilitabla the shelf immediately rose the death eaters then began filing towards the door the shelf trailing behind them taking a deep breath harry withdrew his wand it was now or never he silently intoned accio prophecy hoping that he would not have to say the spell aloud the orb on the shelf wobbled and then flew towards him harry caught it deftly in his left hand he smiled he might be able to get away without the death eaters even knowing he was here would voldemort ever be irate potter said a drawl remarkably like malfoy s harry paled as he looked up accio prophecy cried the female death eater while another death eater sent a cutting spell at him protego said harry as he tried to dodge in the cramped space the shield spell stopped the summoning charm and forced the cutting curse to rebound the errant curse hit the shelf behind him causing it to collapse toward him harry dove past it rolling back into a standing position the shelf crashed and several transparent forms rose from the wreckage all trying to speak at the same time harry was about to transform when he realized he did not have the prophecy has the wittle little baby potty lost his toywoy asked the female death eater in a baby voice harry did not bother to banter his wand was not raised but his left hand was he hoped he did not look like an idiot expelliarmus a red light shot out of his hand hitting the very surprised death eater who had been waving her wand about as she talked both wand and prophecy shot into the air he did not give the others time to react as he blindly shot a cutting curse toward the group forcing several to raise shield charms while the others dove out of the way accio prophecy the orb began moving toward him but stop as several other summoning charms began pulling on it six death eaters had their wands pointed at the prophecy while the other six were flanking him i donthave time for this harry thought desperately accio prophecy he yelled the orb began to fly toward him but again several of the death eaters tried to summon it this time however the orb did not stop but went careening in a different direction altogether all the death eaters followed its progress with their eyes forgetting to move or pay attention to harry forget it harry just get ginny voice cut off in his head one of the death eaters shot a violet colored spell at harry and again he tried to roll out of the way like before the spell hit a shelf causing the prophecies to fall to the floor breaking harry did not know if ginny had stopped talking or if hitting his head as he dodged the spell had something to do with it he was now running toward where he thought his prophecy had rolled to stupefy cried a death eater behind him sending a red light past his head harry swiftly ducked behind the next row harry darted out from behind the shelf and sent his own stunning spell at his pursuers diffindo this time the spell grazed harry shoulder impedimenta harry sent the curse toward the approaching death eaters slowing them down in the narrow corridor reducto the spell hit the top of the shelf he was hiding behind showing him in debris harry immediately moved deeper into the row for more cover the last spell had not come from in front of him but from behind the death eaters had flanked him harry looked around desperately for the prophecy but could not see it accio prophecy harry smiled as the small orb flew through the air toward him and then stopped he decided that he did not need to get the prophecy only stop the death eaters from obtaining it destarro harry said pronouncing the banishing charm the combined power of the death eater summoning charm and harry banishing charm sent the prophecy toward the death eaters at a reckless speed it flew past the summoning death eater and impacted against the wall noooo several voices called out harry ran away from the commotion hoping to find a place out of sight before transforming he did not want voldemort to find out about his animagus form potter where are you yelled one frustrated death eater harry thought he recognized lucius malfoy voice harry did not respond but transformed into a phoenix and flamed back to hogwarts ginny had been so worried about what harry was doing that she had not even noticed umbridge and the rest of the inquisitorial squad appear the five of them had been quickly disarmed and umbridge had had them frog marched to her office she was pacing before them where is harry potter do you know where albus dumbledore is umbridge demanded no one answered umbridge peered at each of the five but stopped when she got to luna why dontyou tell me where potter is luna blinked her large protuberant eyes at umbridge and then said casually as if observing the weather did you know nargles have infested your hair umbridge eyes narrowed at the girl obviously trying to figure out if luna was being insolent or if she was crazy eventually umbridge must have decided on the latter because she turned on the rest of them where is potter like we would ever tell you grumbled ron who was being held firmly by crabbe oh but i think you will umbridge opened a draw in her desk and removed a vial of clear liquid ginny caught hermione eye and knew that the smart witch was thinking the same thing veritaserum force their mouths open commanded umbridge neville ron hermione and ginny all fought to keep their mouths closed luna however did not a slightly worried look crossed umbridge face as she dropped a few drops of the liquid into luna open mouth luna showed no signs of the being drugged but then ginny was not sure what luna would look like drugged where is harry potter repeated umbridge didntyou already ask me that question responded luna with her own question umbridge sighed and then moved toward ginny ginny followed the toad progress with her eyes and when she thought she was close enough pushed hard with her feet driving her shoulders into the large girl holding her ginny use the older girl mass to then propel herself forward umbridge was not expecting the sudden attack and did not move quickly enough ginny head knocked the vial out of her hand and the vial broke on the floor you stupid girl cried umbridge fine i didntwant to do this but i dont see any other way now i sure fudge will understand the cruciatus curse is clearly justified umbridge raised her wand and pointed it at ginny no wait i ll tell you pleaded hermione her face frantic ginny considered herself a good actress but compared to the performance hermione had just put on made her look like an amateur she had no idea what hermione was planning but knowing hermione it was going to be good she never did anything half way it was a few minutes after hermione and ron had left leading umbridge into the forbidden forest that ginny regained her senses the four slytherins that were still holding them captive had just finished tying their hands behind their backs and ginny was desperately trying to figure out how to escape she tried to remain calm but it was becoming difficult she did not know what hermione had planned and harry needed help the stubborn boy refused to leave the ministry without the prophecy which meant she had to find a way to get free the binds on her hands made transforming a bad idea and her wand was sitting on umbridge desk ginny looked at the slytherins out of the corner of her eye the four were huddled around the still sleeping malfoy trying different spells and counter curses to wake him up ginny briefly noted that she would have to ask luna about the spell if only well if harry can cast a spell wandlessly diffindo she said quietly the cord binding her hands fell to the floor severed ginny held her breath waiting for any of the slytherins to react but they did not hear her stealthily she stood and carefully walked to umbridge desk retrieving hers neville s and luna wands the four slytherins never knew what hit them hurry we need to ginny trailed off as harry flamed into the room he had unconsciously homed in on ginny location harry you look awful she said as she practically threw herself at him harry stumbled backwards under the onslaught but hugged ginny back ginny pushed away from him holding his shoulders and looked at him critically examining him head to toe after a few seconds and making him turn around to inspect his rear ginny slapped him in the back of the head why didntyou just leave that stupid prophecy doesnt mean a thing if you get yourself killed what where ron and hermione interrupted harry they oh no they went into the forest with umbridge ginny said as she grabbed harry hand leading him out luna and neville on their heels they stopped running after exiting through the main doors which way asked neville scrutinizing the forbidden forest with fear right there came luna calm voice from behind them for once not dreamy what ginny asked turning to face luna luna did not verbally respond but raised her hand and pointed hermione and ron were running full tilt out of the forbidden forest harry and ginny led the way to them meeting them halfway what happened asked harry hermione s plan worked too well puffed ron as he took a breath between each word she tricked umbridge centaurs offended angry then then grawp what neville asked his face a mask of confusion ronald said that hermione tricked umbridge into going into the forbidden forest where the centaurs were offended by her presence and behavior then when the centaurs became angry at them grawp who grawp intervened allowing them to escape explained luna as if it had been perfectly clear five heads turned in unison to stare at luna sirius black apparated into the atrium of the ministry of magic with the other members of the order of the phoenix that could be contacted on short notice arabella figg had flooed dedalus diggle after finding headquarters empty the excitable wizard had then had contacted all the other members of the order he could they ll be in the department of mysteries noted shacklebolt let go commanded the auror they had just reached the hallway to the elevator when remus who was in the lead stopped he was kneeling over something and then said in a tight voice it percy he dead he must of tried to stop him on his own no time now move ordered mad eye which was shortly followed by the sound of his peg leg on the hard floor remember press yourselves against the sides of the elevator the might be waiting for us the elevator doors opened slowly and with a loud ding but there was no attack and the eight order members fanned out stay together they have to come back this way if they want out of the ministry said shacklebolt calm voice well defend the several shouts of stupify interrupted the attempted order dedalus diggle fell immediately stunned on the floor the others dove for what cover there was and the battle started the death eaters used their numbers to their advantage shacklebolt moody tonks lupin and sirius all had to duel two opponents ha came tonks victorious cry as one of the death eaters collapsed curses hexes and jinxes rang out and different colored lights crisscrossed the area soon moody was done and shacklebolt had taken up his opponents after dispatching his own tonks too was incapacitated by bellatrix sirius had taken her position opposite his cousin sirius wand was a blur as he used a shield charm and then sent a curse bellatrix was getting frustrated crucio she yelled sirius dodged to the left and grinned at her is that the best you have cousin he taunted bellatrix redoubled her efforts aahhh screamed emmeline vance after a cutting curse cut deeply into her left thigh impedimenta stupefy she cried in response sending the death eater careening across the floor sirius had been distracted by emmeline cry of pain and bellatrix had taken advantage of it stupefy he dodged again but was not fast enough to raise a shield against the purple spell bellatrix followed up with sirius flew backwards from the spells impacted hitting his head hard on the wall dumbledore apparated into the atrium with barely a pop his eyes roamed the empty room until they settled on something in the distance percy he thought dumbledore did not move from the room center he knew voldemort had to be nearby by now there would be no doubt that voldermot knew that either he or harry had to remove the prophecy and harry was safe at hogwarts slowly circling dumbledore examined every dark corner the atrium provided hello tom dumbledore said as he drew his wand dumbledore came the hissing voice of lord voldemort avada kedavra dumbledore disappeared with a swish of his cloak and then reappeared several steps away the spell missed dumbledore and hit the statue of magical brethren shattering the witch wizard and the centaur head with a wave of his wand the remaining pieces of the statue animated the goblin house elf and centaur body began circling the two wizards voldemort issued a high pitched laugh this is the best you can do i expected more from you voldemort said although he was keeping an eye on the roving statues one of dumbledore eyebrows raised give up now tom you cannot win perhaps it was the use of his childhood name but the statement enraged voldemort avada kedavra he yelled sending a green light flying from his wand tip it never reached dumbledore as the centaur had darted out from its circular patrol to block the spell you will run out of guardians soon old man it was foolish of you to come here tonight tom the aurors are on their way by which time you will be dead and i gone responded voldemort and he sent another killing curse at dumbledore it missed and hit the guard desk disintegrating it dumbledore moved quickly and a deep purple light emanated from his wand voldemort eyes widened in surprise and he conjured a large silver shield to block the spell the force of the spell caused a loud gonglike sound as it impacted the shield voldemort stumbled backwards from the spell strength you do not seek to kill me above it are you dumbledore taunted voldemort dumbledore face took on a pitying gaze there are other ways to destroy a man tom you know that dumbledore continued calmly walking toward voldemort the house elf and goblin still circling voldemort growled in immediate response and then blasted the goblin statue as it neared him and then raised his shield expecting an attack there is nothing worse than death you are wrong tom very wrong dumbledore said as he drew he wand back and brandishing it like a whip a red flame wrapped itself around voldemort forcing the dark lord to drop the shield with a clatter quit calling me by that name answered voldemort angrily still struggling against the flaming bond he managed to flick his wand and the whip of flame transformed into a large snake that bared its fangs and dove at dumbledore dumbledore stepped backwards and performed a complicated wave of his wand causing the snake into the air as it started to fall back to the floor the snake disappeared in a puff of smoke voldemort raised his wand to take advantage of dumbledore distraction when a voice rent through the air master he destroyed it bellatrix lestrange stopped moving when she saw that dumbledore was there uncertainty and then a predatory gleam lit her eyes two on one green fires exploded in the grates surrounding the atrium voldemort cringed another time dumbledore come bella the dark lord apparated followed quickly by bellatrix after several serious faced men had emerged from the grates with drawn wands another man with a large green bowler hat came tumbling out of the nearest grate dum dumbledore what what the meaning of this cornelius fudge quailed as dumbledore turned his gaze upon him they were helping ron and hermione back to the castle when a cold voice stopped their progress potter and company snape said as he approached them robes billowing behind him report to the headmaster office immediately the password is cockroach cluster harry eyed the potions professor warily snape looked livid and he was rubbing his left forearm yes sir thank you sir answered a still breathless hermione from her race out of the forest snape scowled longbottom lovegood take weasley and granger to the hospital wing ron looked like he wanted to protest but a swift elbow in the ribs from hermione silenced him snape stalked off overgrown bat mumbled ron ron you shouldn t began hermione and why not hermione snape only unhappy because one of us isntdead or dreadfully wounded rebutted ron we ll see you in a bit harry said as he grabbed ginny hand and began walking to the headmaster office when they entered the headmaster office they found it empty they looked at each other unsure of what to do before shrugging and sitting in the empty chairs in front of dumbledore large desk after ten minutes of silence harry finally got up the nerve to ask a question at the portraits which were pretending to be asleep where dumbledore he asked addressing them the former headmaster continued snoozing their only response was even louder snores although a few did open one eye or peak through their hands at him harry sighed in exasperation we know you re awake quit faking commanded ginny a few portraits stopped pretending to sleep and sat up straight slight blushes at being caught now where is dumbledore we only answer to the headmaster answered a nasal voice of phineas nigellus in other words we dontknow quipped a witch we really arent supposed to talk to anyone but the headmaster you know worried another wizard whose hat was sitting crookedly on his head none of that nonsense commanded a formidable looking witch who was shaking a wand that look more like a club than a wand at the other portrait we all know who these two are yes yes precious potter and potter said phineas sarcastically the two wonder children how dare they come in here and demand things out of us they show no respect why in my day phineas stopped talking to watch the witch with the large wand she was now shaking her wand at him and he was eyeing it with look of apprehension harry guessed that the headmasters and headmistresses must be able to move between portraits yes they are a wonder said another portrait harry had never noticed before it was behind the desk and looked to be very very old there were only three other portraits near it the portrait tone had none of the sarcasm that phineas voice had held mr potter mrs potter come closer i would like a better look at you two harry felt incredibly nervous something about the portraits voice bespoke of great age and wisdom he felt like he was approaching royalty the other portraits had also grown conspiculously quiet the portrait surveyed him with a critical eye before looking at ginny the rumors just might be true it would be horribly poetic too said the aged man who looked a bit like an old lion with his hair sticking out all over the place what do you think old friend dumbledore has been terribly cagey about it another portrait with a green background but built in the same type of frame answered yes he does have some of the traits the hair always uncontrollable then there is the girl dumbledore did slip up that once about his father and mother potters and redheads what a magnificient combination that what he said harry and ginny shifted uncomfortable i do believe it is so what do the ladies think harry eyes shifted to the other two portraits harry i think i know who these people are yeah me too harry said a little breathlessly they are cute together bondings are so rare nowadays it a shame we are simply going to have to have a long discussion one day i very curious about your bond the last pair i talked to was the flamels but they had ages to develop their bond albus says yours developed when you first met how fascinating the old witch reminded harry of mrs weasley she radiated kindness and acceptance yes yes but what do you think helga asked the portrait with the green background with obvious vexation i do see your point his hair is rather unruly harry was sure the witch would have tried to flatten it if she had been able and his face does have some recognizable features she pursed her lips as she surveyed him do you have knobbly knees harry blinked at the question and nodded the witch grinned well i suppose it could be a coincidence but i doubt it so much time has passed that it could be a coincidence and rumors are only rumors after all said the fourth witch who had remained quiet up until now but there are far better clues than his appearance tell me mr potter is it true that you were able to wield that sword she nodded her head stately toward gryffindor sword yes ma am answered harry the witch reminded him of mcgonagall but the sorting hat tried to put you into slytherin asked the witch harry nodded that may only be because of the scar my fool of a descendent left interjected the portrait with the green background there was no longer any doubt in harry and ginny minds as to who these portraits were why dontwe settle this then said the first portrait how do you suggest going about that asked the kindly witch why the sorting hat of course it will tell us where he belongs we just have to tell it to look deeper the wizard answered and slapped his hands together in anticipation it would be nice to know if one of us has a descendent left said the wizard harry was pretty sure was salazar you do have a descendent answered the witch who had to be rowena ravenclaw salazar harrumphed a man with only half a soul is not something i would call a descendent enough of this harry put on the hat said the probable godric gryffindor when harry did not immediately move the man gestured for him to i did not expect this who knew the hogwarts founders were on the wall behind dumbledore desk asked ginny why are they so insistent about this asked harry as he gently lifted the sorting hat off its shelf who knows ginny cast a look at the four portraits who were watching harry with rapt attention they reminded ginny of her brothers when a bet was about to be decided maybe they ve made a bet harry was about to put the hat on his head when a large ball of fire emerged from no where dumbledore and fawkes had arrived harry froze still holding the hat a few centimeters from his head dumbledore surveyed harry and then ginny before eyeing the portraits most of which had gone back to pretending to being asleep he raised an eyebrow at the portraits and then said to harry and ginny have the portraits being talking to you harry thought it was strange that the first thing dumbledore asked after being away for nearly the entire term was to question him about if the portraits talk to him er yes sir many of the portraits looked embarrassed and chastised dumbledore eyes twinkled even these four dumbledore gestured toward the four portraits in the back of the room which were looking defiantly back at him nothing in their demeanor held a hint of embarrassment yes sir answered harry again they can be most interesting when they choose to speak but they rarely do dumbledore said as he moved to fawkes perch and let the phoenix hop onto it ginny case a look behind her to see the portrait she thought was godric motioning for her to pull the hat down onto harry head helga was nodding her head in agreement salazar somehow managed to give a bored smile of encouragement however rowena rolled her eyes at the other portraits antics why dontyou try the hat on harry they do seem to want you to dumbledore beard twitched as he smiled harry lowered the sorting hat onto his head and waited it has been a long time mr potter i see i supposed to look deeper well let have a look a minute passed and nothing happened harry was getting a little imapatient when the hat broke into his thoughts dontget impatient i looking deeper there was an unmistakable smugness in the voice you dontthink just anyone could do this do you another minute passed and still there was no response from the hat harry looked at dumbledore for guidance patience harry it is no small matter to sort out a thousand years of lineage dumbledore said hmmmm yes there it is it is difficult to tell for sure though the soul bond does confuse matters but yes there is little doubt i can see it in your very essence mr potter tell them yes harry took off the sorting hat and put it on the shelf before turning back to dumbledore it said yes dumbledore nodded and then said tell them harry feeling a little childish at forgetting the founders behind him harry turned erm the hat said to tell you yes ha i told you my line would outlast all of yours yelled a jubilant godric gryffindor hush godric there is no need to gloat responded a scowling rowena what about riddle asked helga technically he is still an heir of salazar here barely an heir he is he only got half a soul left at most retorted slytherin godric raised an eyebrow and then said seriously then you do not condone his activities harry looked back at dumbledore who was paying attention to the conversation with a great deal of interest salazar slytherin sighed and bowed his head dramatically we ve had this discussion before yes i was deluded yes i was foolish yes i put a basilisk under the school yes i ve changed my bloody mind but i still think the last few words were unintelligible you still think what prodded helga i still think it best for us to keep to ourselves consorting with muggles only leads to trouble muggleborns may not deserve death but there should be a better hierarchy to our society salazar said defensively perhaps in another thousand years we will be able to change this notion as well responded rowena with that statement all the portraits except gryffindor went static appearing to be normal non magical pictures welcome to the family my boy gryffindor said before he too went static sit down we have several matters to discuss dumbledore said as he moved to his own chair when the three of them had seated dumbledore began first harry i would suggest that neither of you tell anyone about what you have just learned here they both nodded even without the prophecy its revelation alone would force more responsibility on you than you could ever want does voldemort know asked harry what are you thinking queried ginny maybe it wasnt just because i was the half blood that he went after me no at least not for certain alas dumbledore said with a hint of sadness there have long been rumors that the potters were related to gryffindor tom riddle would certainly have come across these it probably did play a part in his choice to attack you first rather than the longbottoms i afraid there are more current matters to discuss however something in dumbledore voice worried harry there was a fight at the ministry mrs figg was able to deliver your message and a group from the order went to the ministry there have been some casualties harry reached over a grabbed ginny hand she squeezed it the order had a spy within the ministry he cast a look at ginny and harry felt fear and dread permeate her i received an urgent message from him but by the time i arrived i was too late percy was already dead ginny closed her eyes trying to stop the tears harry stood they embraced and ginny stopped trying to fight the tears alastor tonks and sirius were all injured and have been moved to st mungos i afraid that while the ministry has now been cured of disbelief they still believe that sirius is a criminal despite my best efforts they have placed him under arrest he under armed guard dumbledore gazed at the couple sadly wishing he had better news harry i have to ask were you the one who destroyed the prophecy yes sir i dont think anyone saw me transform though defended harry hoping that the headmaster was not angry with him is sirius all right sirius is fine he had a rather nasty head injury but the healers at st mungos have it under control and i ll deal with the ministry dumbledore cocked his head slightly you battled twelve death eaters alone impressive harry very impressive they will not underestimate you again which leads us to the next problem dumbledore shift uncomfortably in his seat he knew that now was not a good time to broach the issue especially after just informing them of percy death but there simply was not time to put it off harry i need you to go back to the dursleys for a little while this summer harry held ginny tighter and looked at dumbledore like he d lost his mind ginny stopped crying but did not move but the wards the wards are weak but amazingly still there i have been doing some research and i believe i have found a way for you to recharge them after a full forty eight hours seeing harry preparing another protest dumbledore quickly continued i know you dontwant to go back and i would normally allow you to stay at grimmauld place but there something dumbledore stopped talking and seemed to be trying to find the words it was then that harry remembered the sneakoscope untrustworthy indeed i believe i have found a way to place potter manor under a strong fidelius charm but it will take time to prepare i staying with him came ginny muffled voice dumbledore frowned that would not be wise the wards are incredibly weak having anyone other than harry within them would make privet drive easier to find i promise no more than forty eight hours now i must take my leave of you it seems i have a defense against the dark arts professor to rescue dumbledore massaged his temples as he watched the students boarding the carriages it had been a trying few days fudge was trying to make amends for his past failure but it was not going to help him dumbledore guessed that a vote of no confidence would occur soon political hopefuls were already being vetted right now the most likely candidate was amelia bones that was at least a good piece of news amelia would be fair but strong he had promised harry forty eight hours at most at the dursleys and dumbledore intended to keep the promise the modified fidelius charm was almost completed dumbledore guessed the calculations should not take another four feet of parchment normally casting the charm over a property as large as potter manor would cause the secret keeper to lose his or her mind but harry and ginny bonding allowed for another solution two secret keepers with one spell besides he was sure that the weasley would want harry at the funeral percy death had hit molly and arthur hard neither had known that percy had been a spy for the order dumbledore was regretting not telling them now but at the time it had seemed wise not to he had not thought that arthur would be able to act the same way at the ministry if he had known a knock at the door interrupted dumbledore thoughts on the charm enter ah severus how are you severus did not look well the dark lord is furious he demanding to know how potter managed to elude his death eaters that must perplex him noted dumbledore calmly snape scowled yes i think he planning something big soon my guess is that azkaban will soon be empty dumbledore steepled his fingers and gazed thoughtfully out the window tell voldemort that you know how harry escaped he could almost hear severus jaw drop dumbledore was loath to allow voldemort to know harry secret but voldemort was not dumb he knew there were strong apparition and portkey wards surrounding the ministry there were few things that could move through them at will indeed flame travel seemed the most likely and how did potter snape spat the name manage to elude twelve death eaters harry is an animagus dumbledore said as he turned around he wanted to see severus face snape looked like he was sucking on something sour an animagus just like his arrogant father but how does that help him the only thing that could possibly bypass the ministry wards no not possible dumbledore eyes twinkled the potions master was brilliant if a tad biased against harry harry animagus form is a phoenix snape eyes bulged that not possible dumbledore did not respond but waited for severus mind to process the information the potions master sighed in resignation but it would explain a lot his eyes narrowed and he gave dumbledore a calculating stare you want me tell the dark lord this yes voldemort is smart enough to realize harry had to bypass the wards somehow and there are precious few ways to do that and leave them intact indeed the only quick way is flame travel we are telling him nothing he wontalready suspect and we insure your place in his inner circle the dark lord will not like it snape seemed to be talking to himself he might think this is the power he knows not i dontbelieve so tom riddle succeeded in becoming an animagus before he left hogwarts the boy was always gifted and his form reflected it snape gave him a puzzled look come severus it is very poetic noted dumbledore echoing godric gryffindor words to harry i do not understand snape responded flatly have you never seen him transform i suppose it would not be wise to i wonder perhaps snape shifted irritated as the headmaster began speaking to himself ah yes sorry just entertaining a thought tom riddle was able to transform into a basilisk harry is not the first magical animagus why has he not used the form it would be a perfect terror weapon retorted snape the dark lord had never shown any indication of being an animagus dumbledore again assumed a thoughtful pose i said tom riddle was an animagus with the myriad of transformations he has done to himself perhaps lord voldemort is not snape nodded not truly understanding and left dumbledore dumbledore watched snape leave before sitting down in his chair he did not envy severus job but it was a critical one peering out the window he allowed himself to get lost in his own thoughts before being interrupted by a long trill from fawkes dumbledore smiled sadly at the phoenix it has begun again old friend the second war against voldemort has begun a n here the chapter the title is very appropriate it was a pain to write next chapter will take a couple of weeks though forgot a couple things sometimes ff doesntlike hyperlinks so if it looks funky go to my profile review responses can be found in two places http hannibalbarca and the forums here on fanfiction http disclaimer what do you think i male american and my last name isntrowlings chapter 24 to hell harry suppressed the laughter threatening to escape his lips the dursleys would not like it and considering uncle vernon mental state it was probably best not to overly tax them several members of the order of the phoenix had been waiting on platform nine and three quarters to greet the dursleys and see harry off ginny moody was great the next two days are going to be interesting they wont dare yell at me i bet they wonteven talk to me i ve never seen uncle vernon look so pale dudley doesntlook very good either i ll thank him for you when i see him ginny sent aunt petunia looked back at her nephew and shuddered he was back and now they were all in danger she had not kept up with events in the wizarding world but she had received a letter from dumbledore telling her the news vernon had not taken it very well and he had been acting oddly for several days now dudley was looking pasty as well but then he looked like that every time he got near an adult wizard or witch aunt petunia mentally shrugged she would confront vernon later it would not due to make his stay too unpleasant she did not want any of his kind to show up petunia felt a brief wave of shame at her own thoughts and quickly rationalized that she had done the best she could have done under the circumstances she had not wanted the boy thrust upon her she had not wanted to be connected to that world in anyway most of all she had not wanted the constant reminder of her estranged dead sister taking special care to ensure his trunk did not leave marks on the stairs harry slowly made his way up to the smallest bedroom of number four he only had to stay for forty eight hours at privet drive and he intended to spend very little of it within sight of the dursleys he had been right so far none of the dursleys had even said a single word to him indeed only aunt petunia had so much as looked at him the entire trip to number four had been odd at first he thought it was due to moody threat but he was not sure now both uncle vernon and dudley looked pale and fidgeted a lot aunt petunia was constantly glancing at the two of them with an expression he had never seen on her face before at least when she was looking at them suspicion any news he asked ginny as he flopped down onto the uncomfortable single mattress that the dursleys insisted was a bed he was not sure how best to comfort ginny but sent what comfort he could through their bond trying to mentally hold her the situation with the dursleys had temporarily distracted her from percy loss but the shock of percy death was returning no dumbledore will be here soon the usual vibrancy in ginny voice was gone harry desperately wished he could hug her ginny was back at the burrow with the rest of the weasley family they had been informed of percy death and that the ministry would be releasing his personal articles to them that night dumbledore had also said he wanted to talk to them and that he would retrieve percy articles from the ministry ginny was grateful for dumbledore volunteering to do so she did not think her father was up to the task at the moment from the family reaction it was clear that dumbledore had not yet told anyone except harry and ginny that percy had been a spy ginny had been tempted to inform them but there never seemed to be a right time and she was afraid it would only make them feel worse consequently she had spent most of her time lying in bed the fact that percy the same percy who had never broken a rule in his life was dead had yet to sink in the family gathered around the fireplace awaiting dumbledore arrival it was obvious mr and mrs weasley had been crying bill and charlie also looked they had lost their own battle to tears the twins and ron however remained stone faced but were pale the fireplace glowed green and professor dumbledore stepped out he surveyed the room with a solemn expression molly arthur i sorry for your loss dumbledore held a cardboard box out to them these were the personal effects from his office there are letters addressed to all of you mrs weasley collapsed into the nearest chair and broke out into tears mr weasley took the box gingerly as if fearing that it would break if he handled it roughly he sat down and put an arm around his wife who put her face into the crook of his neck and continued crying with his other hand he opened the box the letters were at the top mr weasley sucked in his breath as he removed them there were eight letters in all each bore the name of a weasley in percy precise handwriting molly love you should read yours here he said laying the letter on her lap he set his own aside bill charlie fred george ron and ginny mr weasley shook his head as he finished passing out the letters percy had put them in order by age unshed tears prickled his eyes it was typical percy ginny slowly opened her letter her eyes stinging with still more tears her breath caught in her throat as she unfolded the parchment it was addressed to both her and harry by the time she had finished the letter her tears were flowing freely oh you stupid noble git she distraughtly exclaimed to no one bill and charlie were both sitting solemnly rubbing their eyes from time to time her father was holding her mum who was mumbling unintelligibly ron had buried his face in his hands fred and george however were staring at each other with expressions of the utmost shock i dontbelieve it said fred blinking owlishly at his twin he pulled one over on us interjected a dumbfounded george fred solemnly bowed and shook his head i didntknow he had it in him the twins did not say another word dumbledore gave them several minutes to control themselves before starting to speak percy sent a letter to me near the beginning of term explaining his position that he had found out about harry and ginny soul bond he volunteered to spy on the ministry for me it was his idea to keep his change of heart a secret from you he didntbelieve that you would be able to act the same way around him if you knew i agreed with him several of the weasley faces showed anger but it passed quickly as sorrowful pride replaced it do you know who began mr weasley percy was brave i believe he was killed by voldemort himself his last act was to send a message to me dumbledore answered somberly mr weasley nodded his head sadly proud of his dead son bravery mrs weasley began crying harder into her husbands shoulder we think were going to go to bed early tonight said fred the usual cheeriness and mischievousness gone from his voice yeah it been a long day agreed george dumbledore paced in his office too much was going on at the same time the wizengamot was due to cast a vote of no confidence any day now sirius was under armed guard at st mungo s percy weasley funeral was in two days and a large turnout was expected there had already been several small death eater attacks harry was due to be moved to potter manor in twenty four hours and now severus snape had sent word that he needed an immediate meeting dumbledore calmed himself and sat down he looked at his desk and his eyes settled on the neat stack of parchment he had not been able to sleep last night after speaking with the weasleys he had not wasted his insomnia acquired time the sun had heralded his completion of the calculations that were required to cast the adapted fidelius charm a small self satisfied smile appeared on his face the adaptation was quite ingenious the fire glowed green and a much harried professor snape exited the fireplace effectively distracting dumbledore from his thoughts severus you said you had news he asked too tired to be polite and offer a lemon drop yes snape was breathing heavily and he bore the telltale signs of exposure to the cruciatus curse the dark lord is planning on trying to blackmail the minister of magic he going to demand the minister turn over the ministry or there will be large scale muggle attacks when asked dumbledore the tiredness immediately leaving his voice he going to wait until fudge is out of office i think replied snape as he sank into one of the chairs in the office has he made any comment about harry questioned dumbledore even in snape current state the potions professor managed a look of disgust at the mention of harry name yes he wants to capture potter he believes the boy knows the prophecy snape gave dumbledore a calculating look he already knew about potter animagus form dumbledore looked up sharply do you know how bellatrix i think snape said with a resentful tone the dark lord was not pleased that i did not inform him sooner what does he know of the wards around privet drive pressed dumbledore snape did not answer immediately seemingly still out of breath he only says that they are formidable and that potter is only better protected here at hogwarts though i am sure that is due to your presence not the wards yes even after only one night the wards around privet drive are stronger than even those here at hogwarts you believe that he will attempt to capture harry when we move him then asked dumbledore rubbing his left temple snape nodded i believe so but the dark lord has not trusted me with this information very well you should get some sleep severus dumbledore said and snape slowly walked out of the office fawkes i need you to deliver a message to hestia she ll be near privet drive so be discreet dumbledore said fawkes cocked his head and ruffled his feathers at the suggestion he would be anything other than discreet ginny take the potion ordered harry ginny had had horrible dreams the previous night centering on percy death harry had stayed awake most of the night helping her go back to sleep and then waking her when the dreams became too disturbing by the end of the next day he was as exhausted as ginny was when mrs weasley had seen the dark circles under her eyes that morning she had started on a campaign to convince ginny to take a dreamless sleep potion no i dontwant to she pouted back harry sighed and rubbed his eyes you know if you dontyour mum is only going to keep harassing you you need a good night sleep a sudden image of ginny and he falling asleep at percy funeral filled his head fine i ll take it muttered ginny ginny dear where are you called mrs weasley i up here mum in my room ginny yelled back i coming up with your potion mrs weasley yelled back ginny frowned she still did not want to take the potion but harry had a point and her mum was not going to take no as an answer ginny fell asleep quickly after take the potion harry however lay awake he really wished he could be with her holding her as she slept he reminded himself that in less than twenty four hours he would be leaving privet drive closing his eyes harry willed himself to go to sleep but his mind rebelled and he was starting to wish he had a dreamless sleep potion to take in addition to worrying about ginny and the rest of the weasleys harry was worried about sirius dumbledore had said that he would take care of the problem but harry was not sure if fudge was going to be reasonable maybe rita can help he thought and smiled wickedly he was sure that rita skeeter would love to write about ministry incompetence he rolled over onto his side and just as he was starting to drowse aunt petunia shrill voice brought him back to consciousness what exactly have you done vernon harry shook himself to complete wakefulness in all his years with the dursleys aunt petunia had only raised her voice a few times at uncle vernon and never with the tone she was using now it was a mixture of horror fear and anger tell me exactly what you have done came aunt petunia voice again harry could not make out uncle vernon voice but evidently his reply did not satisfy his aunt you and dudley di did what the question was followed by silence and then when you complete and utter fool roared his aunt harry had not known aunt petunia could roar he stood up and moved to the door in order to hear the arguing better did you think i kept him just because he was dropped off on our doorstep oh good lord what am i harry come down now bring your owl harry had never heard aunt petunia sound more decisive in his life harry heart started to race as he considered the possibilities he could not believe aunt petunia was actually asking for hedwig it was more than disturbing it was terrifying he hurriedly collected hedwig who gave an indignant squawk and raced downstairs ginny ginny harry called but only felt ginny drug induced sleep across the bond harry stopped when he reached the foot of the stairs vernon was sitting in his large armchair seemingly trying to disappear into it and aunt petunia was towering over him looking remarkably like an irate professor mcgonagall aunt petunia threw uncle vernon a look of pure disgust before turning to harry send word to your your friends that we need to leave now h he coming for the first time harry noted that petunia was extremely pale despite her anger he felt his insides go cold at her words who he asked refusing to believe that aunt petunia who wanted nothing to do with the magical world was asking for help from wizards and had mentioned lord voldemort him she screamed panic tingeing her voice harry grabbed a piece of notepaper and pen from the nearest end table he scribbled a note to the order and tied it quickly to hedwig leg fly fast hedwig go to grimmauld place hedwig hooted before flying out of the nearest window wha what going on said a sleepy dudley as he walked down the stairs why everybody yelling perhaps it was nerves or maybe she had simply reached the end of her tether but aunt petunia rounded on dudley and for the first time in her life yelled at him i cantbelieve you allowed your father to take you to to see tho those people what were you thinking she demanded of the now wide eyed dudley what did they do asked harry timidly his fear quadrupling as he watched aunt petunia yell at dudley vernon went and saw hi his servants and they took b blo blood from dudley petunia said blood harry looked from petunia to dudley and his cold insides turned to ice blood wards blood protection from his mum petunia sister dudley aunt the wards we have to leave now harry looked around trying to figure out what to do and where to go the car was out of the question death eaters were probably already watching the house he could transform and flame them all out he could not take them to grimmauld place it was under the fidelius charm he would not take them to the burrow it was probably as much of a target as privet drive which left potter manor he turned to his relatives i going to transform i want each of you to grab a tail feather and i will get us out of here aunt petunia nodded and after giving dudley and vernon a glare they too agreed the familiar sensation of the animagus transformation was interrupted by pain severe pain harry collapsed to the floor curled up into a ball the pain had been only slightly less painful than the cruciatus curse he opened his eyes to find aunt petunia worried face a few inches from his own they must have put a jinx on the house he grunted out need to get outside the jinx s follow me harry commanded harry darted for the back door and heard footsteps behind him good they re following he did not like the dursley s but he would not condemn them although he was severely tempted to in the case of uncle vernon as soon as he was outside of the house harry tried to transform again he felt a rush of joy as he changed into his phoenix form it was just in time to see several red lights fly past him harry settled behind a shrub still in his phoenix form he looked around aunt petunia had been the only one to follow him out and she was now hiding behind the shrub with him in the distance he could hear the death eaters moving another flash of light this one purple left a scorch mark on the door then from the inside of the house a scream issued aunt petunia was up in a flash screaming dudley harry flapped his wings to follow her and had barely risen off the ground when movement caught his eye two death eaters were aiming at aunt petunia he gave a loud trill and the two masked men flinch just as they said their spells sending them hopelessly off course making a snap decision harry transformed back into himself figuring that he would be of little use in his phoenix form and then dove through the door aunt petunia had left open he landed with a thud just inside the doorway and used his right foot to slam to door shut a death eater was pointing his wand at dudley making the large boy twitch and scream harry did not wait his wand shot out of his pocket and into his hand stupefy his spell threw the death eater back and into the wall he pivoted on his foot and then yelled colloportus at the front door causing it to slam shut aunt petunia was fussing over dudley and uncle vernon looked like he had passed out harry frowned he was trapped with death eaters obviously just outside the front door and probably out the back too he could do nothing but wait for whatever help hedwig would bring he moved toward the backdoor and performed the sealing charm on it too he had no plans on making this easy for the death eaters the entire house vibrated as several powerful spells impacted it both doors were showing signs of stress and had fractures running through the wood for whatever reason the death eaters had not bothered with the windows when the front door had started to buckle harry had tried a reparo on it but had desisted after discovering the repair charm negated the sealing charm he had counted no less than eight death eaters he looked down at his watch and then squashed the panic that rose within him only five minutes had passed not near enough time for hedwig to summon help the front and back doors glowed red for a moment and then shattered from whatever spell had been used reducto harry yelled aiming in the direction of the front door a scream told him he had hit someone not wasting time to check he dove behind the sofa out of the corner of his eye he saw aunt petunia flee into the kitchen dudley and vernon had not moved come out come out wee little baby potty bellatrix said or we ll kill your family before harry could do or say anything another voice entered into the fray uncle vernon had regained consciousness now wait just a minute you said that you would only take that freak what do you mean by interrupting uncle vernon bellatrix casually spoke to her comrades kill them two voices on either side of bellatrix then started to say avada kad harry pushed himself up to a kneeling position with both hands extended yelled stupefy two red bolts of light shot out at the death eaters bellatrix smiled evilly as she quickly raised her own wand protego avra at the same moment bellatrix cast the shield charm a frying pan came soaring out of the kitchen hitting the head of one death eater who collapsed and did not get up bellatrix was the first to respond sending the killing curse into the kitchen harry heard aunt petunia scream but did not know if the curse had hit her stupefy cried a death eater from behind harry he barely dodged out of the way in time as he rolled he raised his left hand he did not think he had consciously thought anything but away evidently it was enough to spark his wandless magic as the unknown spell sent the death eater sailing down the hall and through the backdoor unfortunately the dodge forced him from out behind the sofa bellatrix lestrange smiled cruelly as she watched him curse her comrade before she cast her own spell crucio harry ginny woke screaming she flung the covers off transformed into a phoenix and then flamed to privet drive mrs weasley scrambled up the stairs to her daughter bedroom only to find the bedroom empty and bedcovers smoldering ron floo dumbledore tell him ginny gone mrs weasley turned and began running back down the stairs she pushed the backdoor open and kept running until she was outside the anti apparation wards there was only one place ginny would go to if she thought harry was in danger molly weasley apparated near privet drive the sound that greeted her arrival was the most heartbreaking thing she had ever heard a phoenix was circling overhead singing but this song was not one of jubilation nor did it give courage molly rushed into the house noting the scorch marks and the missing door as she did she surveyed the destruction the walls were black the sofa looked like it had been a focal point in the duel and the floor was littered with bodies she recognized harry uncle vernon and his cousin dudley another body this one in a black robe was lying across the coffee table next to a frying pan there was no sign of harry a flash of fire announced dumbledore arrival with fawkes fawkes immediately lifted off from dumbledore shoulder and flew out one of the broken windows in the span of only a few minutes eight order members had arrived alastor moody walked in through the backdoor with a grim expression hestia is dead and there another dead death eater out front looks like a strong reductor curse dumbledore nodded and continued looking at harry dead relatives albus how could this happen i thought he was safe here questioned mrs weasley the accusation in her tone was slight but apparent after a prolonged silence dumbledore answered he should have been but i repeated a mistake i never should have i trusted them dumbledore eyes never wavered from the two male dursleys where ginny asked remus lupin he had insisted on searching the house for harry refusing to accept that harry had been captured dumbledore sighed looking very old she is with fawkes he seems to have calmed her a little never knew a phoenix could sing like that grunted moody there were several nods the song had been completely demoralising almost as bad as a dementor we have to find him stated lupin kneeling down besides the sofa he rose fingering a holly wand where petunia asked lupin still looking at the wand moody grunted in the kitchen looks like she was the only one besides potter who put up a fight is she alive asked mrs weasley coming out of her stupor she tried to wipe away the tear stains on her cheeks moody shrugged and then stated flatly alive but we dontknow for how long she was hit by a nasty curse and she also hit her head on the corner of the kitchen counter she already been taken to st mungo s we have to find him repeated remus how asked moody nudging the fallen death eater with the tip of his boot everyone turned to face dumbledore there was no twinkling in his eyes as dumbledore responded all we can do is search i sure voldemort will have placed his headquarters under the fidelius charm but maybe ms weasley can help with that thirty minutes later they had gathered back at grimmauld place fawkes had abandoned his usual place on dumbledore shoulder to reside on ginny shoulder and he would occasionally issue a heartening trill no one had said much since the return from privet drive ginny had remained in an almost trancelike state since being coaxed back to the earth by fawkes what are we going to do albus we cantjust sit here we need to be searching for him argued molly practically yelling at the headmaster i know molly but we must wait until we know where to look replied albus calmly sit we must wait wait wait for what molly almost roared they were interrupted by a loud reverberating knocking from the door remus lupin stood immediately the old armchair he had been sitting in releasing a puff of dust as he did so dumbledore stood before remus reentered the room with the greasy haired potions professor at the door severus dumbledore said as the black robed potions master entered the room do you know where he is professor snape scowled but answered i am not the secret keeper you can do better than that snape what are the general locations of his hideouts growled lupin snape eyes narrowed and his lip curled in distaste instead of answering he walked languidly over to the coffee table and poured a small glass of bourbon snape eyes glittered as the tension in the room mounted he was obviously gaining some enjoyment out of keeping everyone in suspense until a quiet but hard voice issued answer the question ginny said for the first time since arriving at grimmauld place she moved to face her potions professor a second trudged by now flames smoldered behind brown eyes and there was no mistaking the unspoken threat underlying her words snape wisely answered the dark lord has several locations he could have taken potter he struggled for a moment as if trying to find the right words there the place in wiltshire i doubt that he has been taken there with malfoy capture the place is no longer secure then there a small house in york i believe there is also a large manor in edinburgh dumbledore nodded i believe we will also have to search little hangleton it is where voldemort father grave is located and i suspect a place of residence as well the riddles were quite well off snape opened his mouth as if to say something but quickly closed it what does it matter if we search all of these places they re all under the fidelius without the secret keeper it pointless argued moody malfoy the secret keeper for the place in wiltshire supplied snape and the least likely place they ll keep potter moody growled back his blue eye revolving faster as his frustration grew ms weasley dumbledore spoke very softly as if afraid ginny would explode do you think that if you were close enough you would be able to feel harry snape looked between dumbledore and ginny his eyes narrowing in suspicion and confusion ginny frowned and then closed her eyes before she said yes get me close enough and i can tell you if he nearby her voice had lost the hardness it had had when she had demanded snape answer it now trembled slightly truthfully she was not sure if she would be able to feel if harry was close or not if he was inside the fidelius charm if he was awake he might be able to help guide her but ever since she had woken harry usual comforting presence had been dormant by the time she had flamed to privet drive it had also been cloaked by the fidelius charm harry was unconscious wherever he was to make matters worse even in his current state ginny knew something was wrong his consciousness was confusing it reminded her of how it was after he would wake from a deep sleep but several times worse very well then we will leave immediately we ll search york first dumbledore stood and the image of a tired old man disappeared his eyes did not twinkle but shone with hard resolve remus gather as many as you can we will need to go in force harry will be under heavy guard harry tried to open his eyes but only his right responded the left was swollen shut he did not remember much of what had happened to him since his capture nor did he know how long it had been at least he was thinking a little more clearly that would not last he knew soon death eaters would enter and give him a potion that would cloud his mind harry suspected that it was meant to weaken his mental defenses voldemort desparately wanted the prophecy that he did remember the door to his cell opened and several masked death eaters entered one was carrying a potions bottle the death eater on the left raised his wand crucio harry body tried to writhe but his legs and arms were firmly secured chained to a large wood platform behind him his mouth opened to scream but no sound came out he had screamed himself hoarse a long time ago open wide potter sneered one of the masked men as another grabbed his mouth forcing it open the potion was putrid and had a nearly instantaneous effect let have a little fun with him the dark lord wontmind the death eater to harry right raised his wand the one who had administered the potion grabbed his wrist no the dark lord needs him in one piece the other man scoffed he ll be in one piece do as you re told or you ll face my wand before i hand you over to the dark lord the death eater said and then walked out of the cell the two remaining death eaters looked at each other the other silently shrugged and followed the first out the last death eater looked back toward the door and waited for the other two death eaters to walk out of sight he then turned toward harry and leisurely raised his wand crucio ms weasley there was no immediate response from the girl mrs potter dumbledore raised his voice but still ginny did not respond ginevra ginny blinked and pushed herself off the ground accepting professor dumbledore outstretched hand they re torturing him again she said flatly dumbledore nodded for three days they had scoured york and edinburgh and had found nothing perhaps we should return and allow you to rest suggested dumbledore no one had slept much over the past seventy two hours but it had been hardest on ginny communication with harry had been few and far between quite unlike the amount of torture he was receiving what little information harry had been able to provide was useless in trying to find him no you said there was another place we should look ginny demanded unwilling to stop searching we have to find him dumbledore took a better hold on her arm we are apparating to little hangleton the others nodded mutely remus moody molly and arthur were still with him the others who had started searching with them had either left to rest or to jobs professor mcgonagall had left to continue to lobby for sirius release and to ensure he was not moved to azkaban before dumbledore returned from searching for harry dumbledore was about to apparate when a pop announced someone else apparation it was tonks looking very harried and distressed dumbledore giants attacking the west country she gasped out not wasting anytime dumbledore turned and said keep searching for harry if you find anything send word and i ll be there as soon as possible good luck dumbledore disapparated quickly followed by tonks mrs weasley took hold of ginny arm and said hold on barely managing to keep the weariness out of her voice the group disapparated ginny shivered as she apparated in with her mum despite it being summer the night air was brisk she also hated apparation the others instinctively circled ginny where do we go from here asked arthur his voice toneless is he near he clarified turning to ginny ginny closed her eyes and focused on her connection to harry she opened her eyes quickly and widely he near i think i can get us closer alright stay together i ll take point ordered moody just let us know when we get warm he said speaking to ginny who nodded should we send word to dumbledore questioned molly no if he dealing with giants then he got his hands full let wait until we know something more answered arthur ginny stopped walking forcing the others surrounding her to stop what wrong dear asked mrs weasley something wrong harry he scared and she scrunched her eyes in concentration reading harry foggy incoherent and tortured mind was difficult harry she cried smiling a half minute passed then her smile faded as quickly as it had come and she paled it a trap she yelled harry was never sure how the death eaters moved him from his cell to the chamber voldemort held court in i wonder how they do it this rack doesnthave wheels he tried to shake the rack to make sure of it hmmm maybe they pick it up no they wouldntdo that maybe they levitate it that would be like magic well they are magical that what the wands are for i dontalways need a wand why is a wand harry tried to clear his mind of his bizarre ponderings but it did not really work at least these were mostly coherent whatever potion he had been given kept his mind in a strange state of flux he could not concentrate on anything for long nor could he control his train of thought the only thing that could keep his attention of his drug fogged mind was potter hissed lord voldemort as he walked toward the bound boy it is time for another of our discussions voldemort stopped a couple of feet away from harry and peered into his glazed eyes tell me about the prophecy harry head lulled to the right tell me about the prophecy commanded voldemort again the words seemed to reverberate in harry skull prophecy harry asked drunkenly his voice rough and scratchy yes prophecy encouraged voldemort using the same tone of voice only his face betrayed the excitement at harry first response since being captured there lots of prophecies answered harry with an airy tone the prophecy about lord voldemort oh that one which one harry questioned voldemort hissed out a breath in frustration fine i will have it potter even if i have to break your mind to get it he raised his wand and said legilimens three things happened the moment voldemort entered harry mind first the haze and fog that had gripped it for the past three days vanished second harry conscious retreated behind the warmness of his connection to ginny third the door to the chamber opened admitting a death eater voldemort continued to press farther into harry mind until he found the barrier harry consciousness was hiding behind he attempted to push it aside pain beyond pain racked his own mind as he did so and he was forcibly ejected from harry mind his physical body flung back several feet his hands went to his forehead the location mirroring harry scar what magic is this voldemort snarled m master questioned the fearful death eater voldemort rounded on the intruder what is it his eyes were glowing dangerously and the death eater quailed before them bowing low th the there are intruders near here what voldemort angry red eyes narrowed how many five my lord said the trembling man very well voldemort absently rubbed his forehead gather the others we must greet our visitors voldemort and the man made to leave the room leaving harry when voldemort stopped have a dementor keep our guest company in our absence yes my lord the door grinded closed ginny harry if harry had not been strapped to the wooden slab he would have fallen over from the force of ginny greeting harry basked in ginny presence if only mentally strength was slowly returning to him oh thank merlin you re in little hangleton right we re nearby now hold on wait he knows it a trap the door scrapped open and immediately the temperature seemed to fall several degrees harry swallowed as his mind started to cloud again this time with a cold fog a dementor glided to stand in front of him harry fought to keep it from affecting him but it was a futile battle neither his battered mind nor body was in any shape to try and repel the depressing thoughts the dementor forced him to relive his mother dying to save him sirius about to receive the kiss ginny in the chamber of secrets ginny his mind screamed she was in trouble she was in danger now he began to struggle with his bonds trying to loosen them he heard ginny cry out as remus was impacted by a spell and his panic grew the dementor glided closer reveling in his torment harry was becoming more and more frantic ginny and the others were in danger and he could not do anything strangely he was no longer cold but quite warm despite the dementor proximity the dementor closed the remaining distance between itself and harry as if determined to rid him of the unnatural warmth harry however was only concerned about ginny it drew a rattling breath harry barely noted that his cheeks chilled but the sensation was quickly followed by a warm flush the flush of warmth was not restricted to his cheeks rather it encompassed his entire body the dementor straightened its posture before leaning back down still closer to harry and drew another deeper rattling breath it was then harry noticed the dementor bending over his face this time it was not a warm flush but a raging inferno that rose within him harry his shackles the wooden board he was bound to and the dementor disappeared into a bonfire of flames when it had burnt out nothing remained but a small pile of ashes a n please dont hurt me i rarely leave a cliffhanger but this seemed like a great spot to end the chapter thanks to my beta phoenixaeternum a n chapter 25 no cliffhanger by the way review responses will be up soon a mature scene is toward the end it not graphic but it is suggestive enjoy and thanks for the reviews well i ve been trying to fix the spacing issue and it seems fanfiction has made changes to its software making things difficult that means i cantuse stars tildes and such why i dontknow new yahoo group groups dot yahoo dot com slash group slash fatesdebt or just look at my profile chapter 25 returning home protego cried ginny the curse ricocheted off the shield and the oncoming death eaters scattered aside she could not retreat remus lupin was unconscious under her having jumped in front of a curse meant for her to her left moody was pinned down behind a tree by several death eaters beyond the old auror was mr weasley standing over his wife much like his daughter was doing with remus mrs weasley like remus had been cursed at the onset of the trap now the death eaters were cautiously trying to flank the enraged weasley patriarch we have to get out of here yelled moody who then pivoted far faster than would have been thought considering his wooden leg stupefy arthur grunted in response and hoped moody had a plan they could not apparate almost as soon as ginny had said trap the anti apparition wards had fallen into place they probably did not cover a lot of distance since they had been put into place so quickly but arthur refused to leave his wife and moody would never leave a downed comrade anyway then there was ginny ginny could escape but would not leave her parents or the chance of getting to harry the only reason the three of them were still standing was that the death eaters had unwisely started the attack while they were on the crest of a hill the three of them were trapped on the hill but they held the high ground moody ducked back behind the large tree and swished his wand expecto patronum the frenzy of spells momentarily stopped as everyone stared at moody patronus ginny stared at the silvery creature it was an erumpent the rhinoceros like creature turned and charged the death eaters who scattered again to the sides unwilling to test what would happen if the explosive horn hit them corporeal or not ginny shook herself and then dragged remus behind a small group of rocks the odd silence ended quickly as the death eaters regrouped and under a flurry of multi colored curses charged up the hill she tried to get as much of herself behind the rocks as possible but knew it was only a matter of time now she was being showered in a cloud of fine dust particles from the rock were the death eaters spells were hitting it the rock probably would not last must longer under then onslaught and the spells that missed revealed that the frustrated death eaters were firing more and more spells with green hues she could see moody crouched low behind the large tree which was faring even less well under the onslaught than ginny rock half of the once large tree had fallen to the ground somehow her father had managed to get himself and her mother behind that section of the tree the two men would occasional shoot an aimless spell at the death eaters but now that the death eaters had them pinned they could more effectively flank them ginny get out of here yelled mr weasley lying on his back behind the tree trunk suddenly she felt harry emotions rage he was angry very angry the next moment she felt her insides increase in temperature and the wards around them failed with an audible popping sound the flurry of spells hitting her rock and racing past stopped she edged her head above the rock to see why the death eaters had stopped firing harry about halfway down the hill was a large pillar of fire the death eaters obviously did not know what to make with it and where fanning out so that they formed a semi circle facing the fire unlike the ball of flames that formed when a phoenix flamed in or out this pillar of fire remained for several long seconds before it started to dissipate it took a few moments for everyone eyes to adjust to the loss of light where the pillar of flame had been now stood a man with his back to ginny but she would know that particular back anywhere pushing herself the remaining way off the ground she began moving towards harry her wand clutched in her hand below harry the death eaters reacted as well it potter yelled one avada the death eater to his left pushed his wand down potter is the dark lord stun him the death eaters raised their wands in unison and yelled stupefy ginny started to run to harry but knew she would never be able to outrun the spells but that would not stop her from protecting him afterwards harry had not moved and continued to face the nearing spells just before the red lights of the stunning spells hit him he raised his right hand but made no sound the spells did not hit harry but seemed to envelop him bathing him in a red glow whatever he had done it had acted as a shield it was not the shieldcharm since the spells neither rebounded nor penetrated the shield ginny paid no attention to the strange shield and continued rushing toward him when the soft red glow around harry consolidated to a single red ball in front of his hand harry jutted his hand forward and the red ball lurched forward parting into a dozen smaller balls before raining down on the charging death eaters they exploded like grenades sending shrapnel of red lights in every direction almost every death eater collapsed the few who managed to raise shield charms quickly enough rapidly backed down the hillside seeking cover however it was unnecessary small flames seemed to cover harry body and he collapsed his battered body and mind exhausted just as ginny reached him the death eaters who had not been in the direct line of fire and had been attempting to flank mad eye and mr weasley now began moving back toward their few remaining comrades unwilling to advance but still unwilling to retreat and face the dark lord wrath moody and mr weasley took advantage of the lull to move towards ginny position over harry moody and mr weasley speed was hampered though by a peg leg and mrs weasley deadweight apparate out arthur ginny heard moody growl but paid no attention herself she knew that she should grab harry and leave but she did not want to she wanted to hurt those that had hurt harry and they were going to make it easy for her to do so the death eaters seeing only a petite woman standing above their quarry rallied their courage and began moving up the hill again ginny smiled grimly bates mocos one death eater toppled over backwards cursing as he tried to stop the winged bogeys another death eater shot curse at her but like harry had done she only raised her left hand the curse rebounded harmlessly off her shield instead of lowering her hand she kept her arm raised and the shield stayed in place a soft blue glow flickering around her she did not know how she was doing it but she was maintaining the shield with her left hand and firing curses at the death eaters who seemed reluctant to use the avada kedvra curse in case they hit harry they did try the cruciatus curse however ginny had dodged those attempts unsure if her shield would stand against an unforgivable but had always returned to her protective stance above harry moody and her father had joined her flanking her sides and preventing the death eaters from surrounding them the two very tired wizards and one determined witch continued to fight the pitched battle it looked like they had finally beaten the death eaters back when a series of cracks announced more arrivals at least ten fresh death eaters now stood in a circle at the hill base in the center of the circled death eaters stood lord voldemort without voldemort saying a word the death eaters split into two groups one headed for moody who grunted and bent his neck causing it to crack the other group moved toward mr weasley whose only response was to look grimmer smiling cruelly lord voldemort waited a second and the started to slowly walk toward ginny weasley raising his wand as he did so moody and mr weasley moved to use what natural cover they could moody found the small cropping of rocks ginny had used to stow remus lupin behind while mr weasley tried to use a few small trees as cover ginny had no cover to hide behind and was now very ready to leave but knew that she was not quick enough to transform and grab harry before voldemort reacted panic was rising within her but she refused to let it show to let the monster advancing up the hill have the satisfaction of seeing her scared voldemort threw a stunning spell at her which was easily repelled the snakelike figure continued walking toward her throwing curses as he did so with each curse ginny had to put more power behind her shield but continued to throw her own curses which voldemort almost lazily batted aside a powerful cutting curse hit her shield and rocketed upward the impact of the spell on her shield caused her arm to be pushed backwards painfully into her shoulder as if the spell had been a physical blow voldemort was only a few meters away now and as he drew closer ginny realized that the twisted excuse for a human being had been playing with her give it up you silly little girl taunted voldemort you cantstop me now move commanded voldemort ginny stared defiantly back locking brown eyes with voldemort red ones her defiance enraged him fine crucio unwilling to step aside she tried to force as much power as she could into her shield briefly very briefly she thought the shield had held then the pain hit her her knees buckled as her nerves exploded in pain she fell to the ground besides harry and curled into a fetal position her limbs jerking uncontrollably ginny cried mr weasley but he could not get to her as the three death eaters he was still facing forced him to remain where he was voldemort smiled and actually sighed enough of these games he flicked his wand up and way from ginny then he pointed it at harry unconscious body accio potter no cried ginny as harry began floating toward voldemort she was not thinking of any spell the only thought that passed through her mind was protect harry as she sliced her wand in voldemort direction a burst of bright white light escaped her wand making her hair stand on end voldemort stepped back and raised his wand protego his eyes widened in fear for the first time as the unknown spell passed through his shield as if it was not there the spell hit voldemort left shoulder causing him to spin in a full circle before roughly falling to the ground a faint sizzling sound could be heard and an acrid black smoke rose from his left shoulder voldemort hissed in pain and pushed himself off the ground while ginny did the same only voldemort collapsed back on the ground his right hand holding his left shoulder the dark lord immediately pushed himself up this time with only his right hand before taking his wand in his right as well ginny was breathing heavily and shakily raised her own wand bates mocos it was the first spell that came into her mind and the yellow light shot out at the injured lord voldemort he twisted to the side hissing in pain as his left shoulder moved to avoid the spell time voldemort stopped speaking as several loud cracks announced apparition voldemort eyes narrowed another time the dark lord apparated seeing their master leave the remaining death eaters gathered up their unconscious comrades and using portkeys disappeared ginny collapsed next to harry and pulled his head into her lap before turning around to see who had arrived dumbledore stood behind her along with several others the headmaster robes were torn and looked like they had been singed but he still radiated power she had never been happier to see him closing her eyes and still cradling harry head she fainted blinking wildly to remove the sleep from her eyes ginny looked around and massaged her aching head she was lying in a dingy single bed in an equally dingy room she gave a huge sigh and took a deep breath she was back in grimmauld place while kreacher was obviously making progress transforming the house into something habitable the house still had a dark quality about it that positively caused it to seemingly lurk as if it had its own identity that refused to release the darkness its previous inhabitants had belonged to she looked over to her left there was another single bed in the room and harry was sleeping peacefully on it ginny could not help but feel irritated she was sure her mother had something to do with it with a determined look she slipped out of her bed and silently walked over to harry bed she gave him a nudge and he subconsciously followed her instructions by rolling over onto his side pulling back the covers slightly ginny slid beneath them and pulled the linens back up she then nestled her head in the crook of harry neck and put her arm around him before smiling and falling back to sleep several hours later ginny was still asleep but the remaining weasleys remus lupin mad eye moody and albus dumbledore were gathered in the sitting room mrs weasley was pacing obviously furious and muttering shield i dont believe why cantalbus how dare she it isn t albus dumbledore crystal blue eyes traced the weasley matriarch progress across the room neither molly nor remus had been severely injured and had been quickly cured by madam pomfrey upon waking molly weasley had rushed to the room where her daughter and adopted son were sleeping she never made it past the threshold the door had opened easily enough but she could not enter after several attempts to remove whatever was preventing her progress she had huffed and called the headmaster who had calmly assessed the situation and only stated it appears young ginevra has warded the room it had not helped to calm mrs weasley the rest of the weasleys found the situation rather amusing even mr weasley who surprisingly had come to terms with his daughter relationship with harry faster than his wife watched his wife with concealed amusement how did your fight go grunted moody while at the same time dabbing his left arm with gauze he had refused to allow madam pomfrey to heal him dumbledore tore his gaze away from mrs weasley hard three giants attacked kent with the aurors helping it should have been easy but then dementors arrived dumbledore did not explain further but spread his hands out palms up moody nodded and his one normal eye gained a faraway look bloody giants stupid fascination with fire he said mostly to himself the old auror shook himself so the dementors have left azkaban is the prison secure it was dumbledore turn to nod yes for now it is however i fear it is only a matter of time before they start breeding molly weasley stopped pacing and paled breeding her voice was practically a squeak a shiver ran through the assembled order members bill looked at his mother and decided to move the topic away from dementors i cant believe ginny she looked incredibly fierce when we arrived like a mother bear protecting her cubs everyone nodded no more like a wounded mate growled moody lupin and dumbledore gave discreet coughs as the weasleys traded uncomfortable glances william bill jumped at being addressed by dumbledore using his first name you requested that a miss fleur delacour be admitted to the order of the phoenix i remember her well from the tri wizard tournament a very vivacious girl may i ask why bill narrowed his eyes at his former professor and then worriedly glanced at his mother er yes she well placed at gringotts and the goblins seem to respect her i think she could be a valuable asset he said silently cursing at himself his words sounded far too stiff and rehearsed dumbledore eyes twinkled brightly and bill knew he was going to be pressed further is there no other reason bill uncharacteristically squirmed in his seat as all eyes turned to him curious unlike the others mrs weasley eyes were narrowed in suspicion and with each passing second became more suspicious he looked to his father for support but found only sympathetic amusement i dontwant to keep any secrets from her he mumbled dumbledore beard twitched lupin grinned unabashedly guessing where this was going mrs weasley expression grew intense and mr weasley closed his eyes and heaved a great breath as he tried to prevent from laughing at his son predicament and why is that mr weasley prodded dumbledore bill looked at the floor and thought why oh why did i have to be the first almost inaudibly he said i going to ask her to marry me mrs weasley gasped and then flushed before launching herself at her oldest son she wrapped him in a tight hug oh bill i so happy why didntyou tell us when are you going to do it do you have a ring bill was slowly turning purple the men snickered but mrs weasley paid them no attention as she finally let go of bill who gasped for air greedily she grabbed his hand and forcibly pulled him out of the chair and then dragged him into the kitchen how big of a wedding do you want a flesh colored cord quickly disappeared from underneath the opposite door from the other side of door three redheads exchanged amused looks each had barely stopped themselves from laughing loudly and had been forced to settle for laughing silently finally faces matching their hair the three regained their composure i must say i didnt think anything would distract mum from harry and ginny started fred but that certainly did finished george ron froze as the twins words settled on him harry and ginny harry and ginny alone in the same bed unsupervised maybe we should check on them he suggested the twins gave him maddened looks are you nuts queried george ron scrunched his forehead what are you going off about fred shook his head and put his arm around the youngest male weasley ron ron ron dont you understand little ronnikens ginny warded the room ron blinked nonplussed ginny doesntwant to be disturbed supplied george throwing his arm around ron shoulders too so that the younger but taller boy slumped under the weight he was now eye level with the shorter twins when ron still looked baffled the twins with pitying expressions forced him to sit on the floor so that they could look down at him ron consider this a favor it means you owe us big interrupted fred you do indeed agreed george now think about this harry and ginny are okay ginny and harry are soul bonded harry was just rescued from you know who ginny fought you know who ginny moved into harry bed ron frowned at the last one fred shook his head and looked at his twin i ll take the rest of it think really hard ron ron ears were beginning to redden but george did not allow him time to speak ginny warded the room what does this tell you about ginny feelings about us just bursting in assuming we can actually get through her ward ron opened his mouth to retort that he did not care what ginny felt when his brain put together what the twins had said ginny would kill us he said quietly two identical grins greeted his statement ron huffed though i dontget it how can you two just just just yes ronnie cat got your tongue no that would be hermione dontbe ridiculous fred he wishes hermione had his tongue ron now positively glowing red tried his best to ignore the fred and george comments knowing they would only tease him worse how can you two be so calm about harry and ginny being together he put emphasis on the last word trying to say that he did not mind harry and ginny being together so long as they were not together are you saying you didntsee this coming asked george deadpanned yeah they ve only been attached at the hip since they met contributed fred sarcastically george looked at ron and shrugged besides they are married and i know mum has given ginny the talk fred nodded backing up his brother derailed from his original point ron asked how do you know that both twins rolled their eyes in exasperation it doesntmatter how we know now let talk about you and hermione ron frowned threw his brothers a dirty look and stalked off george turned to his grinning brother touchy on that subject isnthe still grinning fred replied yes cantwait to find out how touchy hermione is on the subject george joined his brother wicked grin ginny woke up and found their positions had changed harry was lying on his back again and she was mostly draped over him she rolled onto her side and rested her head on her hand so that she could look at him he showed no signs of waking but she knew he was only resting whatever he had done it had taken a lot out of him he looked so peaceful lying there she gazed at him for another minute and then gently ran a hand over his brow guiding his bangs off his forehead the past few days had been a very long nightmare for her looking down at him she vowed that no one would ever harm him again he was hers she was so relieved that he was okay and safe again that she had even lost her anger at dumbledore for advising harry to return to the dursleys harry smiled in his sleep and ginny slowly lowered her head and kissed his forehead before slipping out of the bed after using the loo her stomach rumbled and she walked downstairs into the kitchen she pushed the kitchen door open revealing professor dumbledore sitting at kitchen table with remus lupin and her father oh hello professor she said surprised to find him in the house dumbledore smiled at her we were just discussing when it would be best to move you and harry to potter manor i have the spell ready but we must wait until harry is well do you want something to eat asked mr weasley moving to get up i ll find something dontworry about it ginny said as she pushed her father back down into his chair he still looked exhausted from the past few days she also thought that he was probably not taking percy death well percy funeral had provided little closure and it had proven to be a small and quick affair as harry had been missing harry will want to move to the manor as soon as possible when he wakes we can begin the final preparations then answered dumbledore remus looked up from his cup of tea how is he doing he sleeping he very tired ginny said as she poured her own cup and then started to open the cupboards looking for food any word about sirius she knew harry would want to know when he woke up remus gripped his cup tighter and lowered his head dumbledore responded his wounds are healing nicely but the ministry is being obstinate fudge wants to prove he doing something he thinks if he can hold sirius he might be able to remain minister after kent and all those muggles dead he mad exclaimed mr weasley ginny stopped fiddling with the dishes she had heard very little about what had happened in kent i share your assessment and with the dementors abandoning azkaban i dontsee how he can hope to remain minister admitted dumbledore ginny moved her bowl of cereal she was having for dinner to the table grateful her mum was nowhere in sight she looked around and decided they should leave the depressive atmosphere of grimmauld place as soon as possible she turned to dumbledore harry will be ready tomorrow the conviction in her voice left no doubt very good then i will leave to make the final preparations dumbledore said as he stood after dumbledore had left and ginny was halfway through her cereal she began to wonder where her mother was where mum remus gave a small laugh and her father smiled at her question she with bill she looked at remus who was still snickering and then at her father what so funny this time her father chuckled bill is going to propose to fleur and he just told your mother ginny eyes widened and sparkled with mischief so what are they doing mr weasley chuckled again i believe you mother is having him describe exactly how he plans on proposing this time ginny did laugh mr weasley looked up at the clock and sighed i suppose it is time for me to rescue him now try not to torture him too much at least until after he proposes mr weasley walked out of the room and ginny glanced at remus their eyes locked and they both burst into laughter after their laughter subsided remus looked up and shook his head remind me that if i ever propose to tell molly after i do it ginny grinned wickedly remembering how close the former professor had sat next to a certain auror last christmas and who would you propose to remus blushed deeply well um i was just saying that if i propose then warn me smiling sweetly ginny nodded i ll remember that remus grumbled something unintelligible what was that she prodded do you realize how unfair it is that we canttease you and harry it supposed to be a rite of passage you have no idea how much we teased james remus paused a few moments we need to get sirius out turning serious ginny answered actually harry had an idea that might help with that what is it interrupted remus rita skeeter harry could give an interview remus frowned i dontknow i know she did the other interview with harry but that woman is not nice it doesntmatter hermione has information that she doesntwant out remus cocked an eyebrow blackmail his tone was not accusatory but interested she an unregistered animagus explained ginny remus smiled that is good harry woke to a pleasant soft weight on his lips he opened his eyes only to find ginny brown eyes a few inches from his own he felt her smile into his lips good morning she said softly he pulled his arms out from beneath the covers and wrapped them around her waist forcing her to come closer she did not resist i ve missed you he choked out she placed her hands on his chest and pushed away so that she was looking directly into his emerald green eyes harry i only going to say this once so you better listen he nodded a little worried by the emotions he was sensing good her voice dropped to barely a whisper but it was far more effective than yelling dontyou ever do that again harry smiled at her weakly and then said i love you too before kissing her ginny sat up but still remained on top of him now get up go to the loo and cleanup then come downstairs we re leaving for the manor as soon as possible i kind of like this position though protested harry his smile turning into a smug grin ginny wiggled and smiled at him and then said suggestively i know you do now get up ginny did not give him any time to protest before she stood and walked out of the room harry sighed and decided he would take a cold shower fifteen minutes later he was downstairs looking at the wall where mrs black portrait had been he was still a little tired despite his exorbitant amount of sleep he supposed he was rebuilding his magical reserves or something not far from it was a large tapestry harry leaned in to get a better look at the tapestry while he waited for everyone else to get ready it was a family tree across the top of the tapestry was written the ancient and most noble house of black there were a lot of names and it looked like the black house went back at least several hundred years he followed the several branches until he stopped at one narcissa black was linked by a line bolded on both sides by golden thread to lucius malfoy harry frowned at the realization that sirius was related to the malfoy s but figured that considering sirius mother it really did not surprise him his eyes moved further down where sirius name should have been there was only a scorch mark but there was another branch to regulus a black sirius has a brother ginny sent back a mental shrug and he looked closer and noticed that regulus had died in 1980 he wondered how sirius younger brother had died which led him to sirius ginny had filled him in on the situation and he had decided to contact rita skeeter as soon as potter manor was under the fidelius charm fudge would rue the day he refused to let sirius go harry was furious at the man as he was unable to understand how fudge could not know the truth now there had been ample time to interrogate the death eaters captured at the ministry harry felt ginny become irritated as she tried to lift her trunk it was far too heavy for her i ll come up and get it offered harry no i ll do it retorted ginny her stubborn side rearing harry kept quite and waited to see what ginny would do a couple of minutes passed and it became clear that she was not going to be able to lift the heavy trunk he heard her mutter bollocks when her emotions changed she had changed into a phoenix a moment and a fireball later a phoenix with a rather haughty look was standing on top of ginny trunk next to harry harry tried to restrain a smile but could not the smile turned into a laugh as ginny showed her back to him in much the same manner as hedwig did when she was irritated with him laugh it up i will replied harry no longer even trying to restrain his laughter dumbledore chose that moment to walk in he surveyed the situation before speaking his eyes twinkling may i inquire as to what is so humorous ginny was having a little trouble with her trunk was all harry said dumbledore smiled making his beard twitch he was extremely relieved to see harry joking around it appeared he was no worse for wear after his harrowing experience looking at the phoenix dumbledore made an educated guess as to why if you are both ready then we can leave immediately said dumbledore ginny talons gripped the trunk before she and it disappeared in a ball of flame changing into a phoenix harry flew to his own trunk after grasping it he flapped his wings so that he rose into the air before he extended a tail feather to dumbledore soon they too were gone harry stumbled as he transformed back into himself ginny arm caught him before he was able to loose his balance i ve got you she said as she guided him into one of the plush armchairs of the welcoming den two small pops announced the arrival of corfy and dinny how may we serve asked corfy his eyes examining harry with worry dontworry about harry he just needs to rest for a moment answered dumbledore as ginny continued to focus on harry what we need you to do is place these four stones dumbledore reached into his robes and revealed four highly polished black stones at the four corners of the property corfy and dinny took the stones but did not immediately leave to do as dumbledore bid instead they looked at ginny awaiting her confirmation only when she nodded did they leave bonny she called the house elf appeared a moment later please could you get a cup of tea for harry of course mistress ginny replied the house elf the elf appeared a moment later with a steaming cup of tea which harry gratefully accepted he was surprised at his weakness and felt a little embarrassed about it ginny swatted him on the shoulder evidently picking up on his embarrassment you were tortured for three days had voldemort trying to get into your head and then you fought his death eaters hmmm let see there might be a good reason to feel just a little tired harry was about to respond when corfy and dinny returned the rocks are at the four corners of the property sir dumbledore nodded very good harry ginny sit close together the two did as they were told ginny squeezing into the chair besides harry dumbledore then began an incantation that was not in english or any other immediately recognizable language he continued for several minutes then he added complicated wand movements in the direction of each of the four corners of the property a few more minutes passed before dumbledore trained his wand on harry and ginny and made a strange motion with it before intoning ocultan arcano their vision wavered for a moment as if they were looking through old glass but soon righted itself is that it asked harry hesitantly dumbledore smiled tiredly yes only the three of us now know where potter manor is located you two are the secret keepers you must be very careful in your discussions now you do not want to inadvertently inform someone of the manor location how do you know where it is asked ginny i cast the spell so the secret could not be kept from me but i cannot reveal it explained dumbledore may i suggest that we collect your family one of you will need to come to reveal the manor location dumbledore paused and furrowed his brow in thought perhaps it would be better if you wrote down the location of the manor on a slip of parchment he waved his wand conjuring a piece of parchment and a quill i will return to grimmauld place and collect them and we will portkey near the front gate one of you should meet us there i do not believe the gate will respond to me who do you wish to come my family of course lupin and tonks if she around ginny said and quickly scribbled the manor location on the parchment and handed it to dumbledore after dumbledore left she focused her attention on harry let get you up to bed dontyou even think about protesting she said cutting harry off before he even had a chance to think about grumbling he settled for an exasperated glare but knew she was right he was tired after putting harry to bed and instructing corfy to ensure he stayed there ginny flamed to the edge of the manor property and perched on top of the gate she did not have to wait long dumbledore had apparently decided against using a portkey as fawkes was ferrying the weasley family over the very last people to arrive were dumbledore tonks and lupin they were all looking around at the wooded area with interest but their eyes kept skipping over the gate on which ginny remained perched circle around commanded dumbledore as he removed the piece of parchment ginny had given him a moment later they were all staring at the gate and dumbledore had burned the parchment ginny hopped off the gate and transform in mid leap so that she landed on her feat everyone quickly crowded around her but had said nothing so far ginny was not sure how to open the gates there was no latch or other obvious locking mechanism she turned to dumbledore with a questioning look just walk towards them they will recognize you he advised ginny did so and the double gate creaked sending dust up from its hinges it had not opened in some time the others followed her through and the gates closed obediently behind them with a soft clang although they all had been to the manor last christmas it was very different now that it was not snow covered charlie really has to see this place commented bill in awe as he squinted to make out the barely visible hoops of the quidditch pitch everyone laughed at his statement and dumbledore added many of harry ancestors loved the sport i ve never seen it from the front it looks like a castle exclaimed ron when were you here asked a suspicious mrs weasley forcing ron to take several steps backwards in his nervousness as far as she knew ron had never actually gone outside when he was last at the manor dontworry molly sirius and i supervised them the entire time assured remus mrs weasley looked anything but assured the reason it looks like a castle is that is what it started out as commented remus with a faraway look in his eyes all that remains of the original construction is the castle keep which is the center of potter manor there you can make out the different stonework now he said as he pointed toward the manor center i not sure how old the manor is exactly or how long the land has been in the potters hands but it is several hundred years old harry spent the rest of the day and half the next in bed despite the fact he had been ready to get up that morning corfy who had been instructed by ginny to ensure he remained in bed had also instructed the other house elves to prevent harry from wandering he had spent half the morning trying to convince them that he felt fine it was not until lunchtime that ginny took pity on him and informed the elves he was allowed to get up after a large lunch he went into one of the manor many studies he could have used the one in the master bedroom but he was staying as far away from that room as he could out of fear he might be restricted to it again he sat down at the desk and removed parchment and quill from the left drawer ginny was sitting on the couch next to the desk watching him with fawkes perched above her the phoenix had remained even after dumbledore had left although the professor had said he would return shortly how do you think i should word this simple and to the point i cantsee rita not wanting to print something scandalous harry nodded and started to write ginny was right rita would love to write this story as he finished the letter and sealed the envelope he heaved a great sigh relieved to find that he was not tired in the least why was i so tired he asked rhetorically ginny gave him a small smile but did not answer it surprised both of them when fawkes trilled an answer the phoenix had been very quiet since his arrival seemingly content to simply observe the manor inhabitants you burned young one it was not much of an answer but the phoenix seemed to think it was enough i died asked harry in shock no but something similar fawkes ruffled his feathers but smoothed them before continuing you depleted your magic when you flamed to your mate and then fought the dark ones you should not have been able to do that does that mean i can flame without transforming pressed harry it would be marvelous if he had that ability and he wanted to know more as neither he nor ginny had been sure of what had happened fawkes gave a trill that could only be translated as laughter you could try there are some things some powers that can only be accessed under great stress be grateful you were able to flame not that you may not be able to do so later are you saying that harry should not have been able to flame asked ginny cocking his head fawkes considered you both are phoenixes but you are also human there are limits to what your human bodies can absorb what happened with the dementor asked harry again fawkes considered his words carefully some creatures are innately evil a basilisk is an example fawkes feathers ruffled a dementor is beyond simple evil it is the embodiment of all things evil they are foul creatures but what happened is that dementor dead harry asked clarifying his question if the dementor had known you were part phoenix it would not have dared approach you harry sighed at the non answer and fawkes took notice these are matters that will be of no consequence to you your battle is with a dark lord not the dementors that duty belongs to others come enjoy your time with your mate and friends for the rest of the day they took fawkes advice bill remus tonks and the twins were all easily convinced to join ron and them in a game of quidditch as soon as dinner was over however everyone went in their separate directions remus and tonks disappeared first no one missed the fact that the two had disappeared at nearly the same time ron had said he was going to do some studying in the library the statement was so out of character for the youngest male weasley that even the twins forgot to tease him harry suspected that ron was working on something ginny thought it was probably something meant to impress hermione the twins had disappeared into the potions lab in the basement harry and ginny were left alone ginny had then looked around and with a coy expression led harry by the hand back up the stairs to the master bedroom he would have complained at the thought of going to bed early but something in ginny clouded thoughts and she was keeping them as clouded as possible made him eager to follow down on the first floor mr weasley mrs weasley bill and a newly reappeared remus and tonks were sitting around the fire it was good seeing them having fun commented mr weasley the three of them are magnificent quidditch players ron much better than i originally gave him credit for added bill are you going to let me heal your knee tonks asked mrs weasley wand already drawn tonks sighed in resignation fine how you can scrape your knee in the air i ll never know muttered mrs weasley as she healed the cut tonks looked mortified at the comment i ll have you know that i very graceful when i flying then she said lower i tripped when i landed amused silence followed her statement and tonks gave remus a glare that clearly said laugh and you re dead finally mr wealsey broke the silence has anyone seen fawkes this evening i think he gone to join dumbledore guessed remus he was with harry and ginny for a little while but i haventseen him since tonks shrugged to show she did not know i cantbelieve ron is being so studious i so proud of him said mrs weasley changing the subject hermione must finally be rubbing off on him added a smiling remus their o w l scores should be back soon right then we ll find out how much she has rubbed off on him said bill yes in a week or two answered mrs weasley it should be about the same time hermione joins us ron mentioned something about studying with her i sure all of their o w l scores will reflect that noted mr weasley it should be interesting to see how harry and ginny did yes agreed mrs weasley before becoming thoughtful where are they anyway i think i saw them heading upstairs harry seems fully recovered today why asked tonks i think i ll just go check on them mrs weasley said as she rose and left the room mrs weasley had just reached the hallway outside the master bedroom and was about to knock on the door when a soft pop startled her corfy was standing in front of the door may i help you ma am i was just going to check on the children she stated annoyed that the house elf was delaying her corfy did not move master potter and mistress ginny are fine mrs weasley frowned at the pronouncement and now had the distinct impression the little elf was delaying her on purpose i would just like to peak in on them master and mistress potter desire their privacy tonight countered corfy mrs weasley eyes went bug eyed for a moment before corfy spoke again perhaps you would like a cup of tea and a biscuit mrs weasley peered at the elf a few seconds that sounds good corfy began walking toward the stairs and mrs weasley lunged toward the door the house elf stopped but did not turn around ouch yelped mrs weasley as soon as her hand closed around the doorknob she immediately released the offending object it shocked me corfy still did not turn it would not be wise to try to intrude upon the master and mistress tonight what type of biscuit would you like harry deepened the kiss as his left hand buried itself deeper into ginny long hair his other hand settled on her lower back and he pulled her closer to him before allowing it to roam downward one of ginny small hands was frantically unbuttoning his shirt the other was playing with the hair at the nape of his neck when she finished unbuttoning his shirt she pushed away from him and then put both of her hands on his bare chest her eyes held a wild lustful gleam she pushed him backwards so that his knees impacted the bed and he fell onto it her shirt too was fully unbuttoned revealing her bra covered chest he could not remember unbuttoning it she straddled his pelvis her hands still on his chest he then grabbed her shoulders and rolled them over so that he was now in control at first he just kissed her mouth but moved to her neck to the spot just below her ear that he knew she liked she moaned in response and then nipped his neck and then sucked on his earlobe causing him to groan her hands grabbed his buttocks forcing him closer to her somehow she moved to her right forcing him to follow her so that she was now back on top grinning wickedly and in obvious enjoyment she said huskily we have too many clothes on far away in a dark room and surrounded by his death eaters lord voldemort his shoulder still blackened suddenly reached up clutched his forehead and collapsed screaming only one word escaped his hisses and screams of pain potter evidently it has been in the policy not to allow certain non language characters since november 05 they ve only just now put it into effect as a result i ve decided to change the story home to siye siye co uk siye remove the spaces i ve created a yahoo group where you can receive update notices if you only want those make sure you choose special notices only i know this is petty but well i prefer to control the format of my story the lines provides are okay but i find them not to be as effective as null spacing combined with some kind of break the lines alone make the chapters harder to read in my opinion check out my profile forums for the link to the yahoo group as a case in point some of the wording above is disjointed every time i wrote fanfiction dot net it was edited out direct link www siye co uk siye sid11253 let me say this again so there is no confusion this story is not abandoned and will not be its home is changing to siye for those of you who dontlike siye the chapters will also appear on the yahoo group since i have to repost chapters i ve decided to use this as an opportunity to edit what i ve already written in some chapters this will mean additional scenes better grammar spelling and general flow i encourage you to monitor siye or join my yahoo group if you donthave and dont want a yahoo account then you can simply send an email message to the subscribe email on my profile i not sure if you can choose what type of notices to receive if you do this but if you only want the special notices then email me

reading and reviewing if you have questions email me or post them on the yahoo group intromit chapter 26 safe a puff of smoke rose as albus dumbledore pushed the door open it creaked in protest as he forced it open to its fullest extent the house would have been condemned if the muggles could have seen it there were numerous charms preventing them and even most wizards from seeing it however he was not called one of the most powerful wizards of the age for nothing it had not required too much effort to find the gaunt house or what was left of the house as much of the structure had collapsed as he stepped over the threshold albus dumbledore waved his wand silently invoking the bubblehead charm and gave a small cough he did not want any of the stirred dust to enter his lungs the small rickety house had been heavily enchanted and if what he suspected was here then anything could be potentially lethal a heavy layer of dust rested over everything in the house there was an armchair with the stuffing poking out at the cushions in the corner in the center of the room a table was leaning on its side missing one of its legs a few disturbing pictures decorated the walls one featuring a masterful painting of a huge snake with yellow eyes dumbledore thoughts turned to harry potter as he surveyed the battered remains of the house the boy had achieved so much his gaze fell on the picture of the snake a basilisk dumbledore frowned as he remembered a twelve year old boy had killed a basilisk at the time he had been far more interested in harry and ginny intensifying bond but now he could appreciate that the feat was extraordinary then there had been the tri wizard tournament not only had harry managed to succeed in the tournament but had faced lord voldemort then there was harry disastrous fifth year and the boy eventual capture the boy had been through a lot and that was not even considering the bonding it still bothered dumbledore harry had used the debt of fate ritual the use of that ritual told dumbledore a lot but most importantly it told him that he was not alive he would never have allowed harry to use that ritual the chance of success was so minimal that dumbledore was sure it was mathematically impossible this meant that he albus dumbledore had died before harry had used the ritual perhaps before voldemort death dumbledore frown solidified as he slowly walked to the centre of the room he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up straight accompanied by an elusive but familiar feeling where have i felt this before he wondered his mind returned to their previous thoughts and he wondered exactly how he had died there were many possibilities although dumbledore imagined most of them had to do with voldemort it would be embarrassing if he had died by slipping in the tub or something of that sort he made a mental note to get a new bathroom rug right now however dumbledore was worried that he had died doing what he was about to do something was not right about the floor he flicked his wand and waited a few more flicks a couple swishes and a jab later and dumbledore relaxed he had removed a complex web of enchantments surrounding a single floorboard kneeling down he wedged the fingers of his right hand between the cracks in the floorboard and tugged a sea of red greeted harry eyes as he opened them he breathed deeply inhaling ginny scent at the same time he tightened his grip around her waist pulling her closer to him so that there was no space between them ginny mumbled something but it was incoherent harry smiled and then began thinking of what to get ginny for her birthday assuming he could get to diagon alley at all maybe he could ask remus or sirius if they could get him out of the ministry clutches he turned his head to look at the clock on his bedside table it was a little after eight which meant most of the weasleys would be up a soft knocking at the door drew his attention but before harry even thought about getting up a small soft pop issued corfy had appeared holding a tray the minute house elf gave a small bow of the head and then set the tray on the bedside table nearest ginny would you care for breakfast in bed or at the table he asked quietly i suppose we should have it with everyone else answered harry and corfy disappeared with another quiet popping sound harry examined the tray wondering what the house elf had brought if it was not breakfast it was another potion corfy had also left a potion for each of them last night with instructions that informed them that the contraceptive would last for a month the small card that accompanied this new potion was too far away for harry to read without his glasses sighing harry realised he needed to get up he was hoping that rita skeeter would respond to his letter today he stretched causing his body to move away from ginny she rolled over so that she was now facing him and closer to his warm body harry rolled his eyes ginny was not a morning person it was one of the few things they would argue about she liked to stay in a soft warm bed for as long as possible he took his left hand and caressed the side of her face gently putting strand of fiery hair behind her ear ginny he whispered both verbally and mentally m sleep n came her mental reply her verbal reply had been completely incoherent harry chuckled fondly and let his hand glide softly lower first down her face then her neck shoulder under the covers down the arm past the elbow and down to her waist he ran his fingertips over a spot he knew was ticklish ginny squirmed pressing her unclothed body closer to his in a futile effort to escape his fingertips perhaps it was in reaction to his sudden surge of emotions or maybe it was because of his tickling but ginny eyes suddenly flew open harry you prat she said but she was smiling which was a good thing sometimes ginny did not react well to being prodded awake a bit like poking a sleeping lion lioness harry supposed lioness queried ginny closing her eyes and stretching very catlike her hands above her head and arching so that she pressed into harry i think i like that you certainly have the temper of a lioness joked harry as he rolled on top of her ginny pinched him causing him to jump to the side i cantbelieve you re teasing me i not even awake yet corfy left something for you some kind of potion answered harry avoiding the issue but it all the way over there mumbled ginny turning her head to look across the bed get it for me she asked sweetly batting her eyelashes at him harry slipped out of bed not realising until he was standing that he was naked too he heard ginny giggle sticking out his chin and ignoring his rising blush and ginny smug sense of accomplishment he walked around the bed to her bedside table and picked up the tray he squinted at the note corfy had left but he really was almost blind without his glasses which were on his bedside table he walked back around the king sized bed and balanced the tray on one of the bedside table corners so that he could put on his glasses ginny by this point had rolled over closer so that she could relieve the tray of its burdens a faint blush crept up her cheeks rising from her neck but she quickly downed the potion shuddering slightly as she did so taste bad asked harry sitting back down on the bed yes it was awful why does it seem like all healing potions taste bad harry shrugged he had long ago given up finding an answer to that question she handed him the empty bottle and he placed it back on the tray her movement had allowed the covers to slip down so that her torso revealed itself ginny last night was harry did not know how to explain it he cupped her cheek and leaned down so that their lips met the kiss broke almost immediately harry had a sour look on his face dontlook at me like that chided ginny swatting him you ve got morning breath too yeah but you taste like that potion so dontkiss my mouth dumbledore stood up backed away quickly and closed his eyes in concentration the moment he had pulled the board up green smoke had issued from the blackness within the gas quickly expanded to fill the entire house through the shattered glass of the nearest window it began streaming out a small finch went rigid on a nearby tree branch before falling to the ground eyes still closed and a green mist now surrounding him dumbledore began muttering and making complicated movements with his hand thirty seconds later his brow was beaded with sweat but he finally opened his eyes and said evanesco he gave a great sigh as the green gas slowly disappeared once dumbledore was sure the gas had vanished he adjusted his bubblehead so that fresh air was allowed in he bent down to examine what the loose floorboard had revealed sitting on a black velvet cushion was a gold ring set with an onyx stone dumbledore started to reach for it but his hand stopped several centimeters from the ring he was confident that the protections surrounding it had all been removed but looking on the object still caused him worry dumbledore considered himself not only one of the most powerful wizards alive but also one of the most experienced in all of his years he had never handled a horcrux yes he had held the diary but its power had been destroyed and tom riddle abused soul had vacated it dumbledore could sense the power radiating off the ring its malevolence how did i never feel the diary almost immediately dumbledore dismissed the question the diary was meant to be found and tom would have used numerous charms to ensure it appeared innocent this ring was not meant to be found he plucked it from the cushion and hastily placed the ring inside an inner pocket of his cloak not wanting to touch the ring for any length of time longer than he had to harry put another forkful of scrambled eggs into his mouth and swallowed them dryly mrs weasley was bustling around potter manor large kitchen they were using the table in the kitchen for breakfast to his left ginny was fighting equally strong emotions of anger and amusement harry was too busy trying to not look embarrassed to become angry or amused although mortified he definitely was bill and mr weasley both look embarrassed enough for harry their heads were firmly down staring at their plates the twins were barely eating but had wide mischievous smiles on their faces as their eyes bounced between harry ginny and their mum remus was doing an admirable job of hiding his amusement only having snorted once ron was the only oblivious person at the table far too focused on his food to notice the tense atmosphere make sure you dont put too much on your fork harry dear make sure you eat safely mrs weasley advised remus snorted again that the fourth time if she tells one of us to be safe one more time ginny trailed off she just being your mum replied harry quietly i dontcare ginny retorted she must have caught what he was thinking because she quickly followed with and i am not being unreasonable just then a loud crash announced tonks arrival into the kitchen she had tripped over the hem of her robe sorry she mumbled dontworry about it tonks but you should really try to be more safe said mrs weasley moving a plate of food to an open table setting how she had managed to convince the house elves to allow her to cook breakfast and serve them harry did not know as if his thoughts had summoned an elf a pop sounded behind him master harry binny said you have a letter thankful for the distraction harry stood and turned thanks bonny bonny nodded threw mrs weasley a disgruntled look and disappeared with another pop who the letter from asked ron looking up from his food for the first time can i have another serving of eggs and bacon mum harry began unfolding the parchment ignoring mrs weasley comment to be careful opening the letter you dontwant a paper cut lurid green ink greeted his eyes he did not even have to look at the closing to know who had sent this letter it from rita skeeter that was quick commented remus a fire lighting in his eyes why would skeeter be writing to you questioned mr weasley obviously worried i asked if she would like to do an article about sirius answered harry mrs weasley stopped moving the skillet of eggs still several feet from ron plate harry dear i know she wrote that story for the quibbler but i dontthink it a good idea to trust her i donttrust her i trust her to follow her own best interest besides we ve got something on her she wants to keep quiet harry groaned as soon as he realised what he had just said he had a feeling that mr and mrs weasley would not approve of blackmail however before anyone else could comment fred said well well well isntthis something george it is brother mine sweet innocent harry is becoming devious this sounds more than just devious it almost sounds slytherin oh no proclaimed fred blackmailing rita skeeter may be clever and ambitious but it takes courage a lot of courage she one mean lady of course she never liked the ministry much good point sirius story would definitely embarrass the ministry agreed george the twins were silent a moment and then brilliant move harry we couldntdo better ourselves mrs weasley put the skillet down allowing ron to scoop the remaining eggs onto his plate she began walking toward the twins looking like she wanted to give them a good reprimand but was practising self control i need to meet her at the leaky cauldron around two harry said looking toward lupin lupin shifted uncomfortably i dontknow we should talk to dumbledore about it before we go out i dontwant to wait sirius should be free protested harry raising his voice i know lupin expression said that he felt duty bound to keep harry safe but the man did not say anything more but nodded no commanded mrs weasley harry it not safe for you to go out in public harry sighed and prepared to argue back but ginny had finally been pushed over the edge with her mother using the word safe again regardless of the lack of emphasis on the word this time i am so very tired of hearing about us having to be safe mrs weasley hands went to her hips well if you wouldntdo dangerous things then you wouldnthave to be safe ginny pushed back from the table and assumed a similar position i can do what i want to do whether it safe or not by this time everyone else was edging toward the doors even ron had given up on his breakfast and was backing away oh really i dont have a say do i i gave birth to you you re my baby this was the wrong thing to say and ginny somehow turned a darker shade of angry red oh yes i always the baby arenti everyone else including harry moved quickly for the door tonks falling over remus as she lunged for the exit i am not a baby roared ginny through the door causing all of the weasleys to flinch harry rubbed his temples ginny anger was seeping into his own mind and the unpleasant emotion was giving him a headache but he knew better than to voice any discontent arentyou going to do something whined ron as mrs weasley voice could be heard vibrating through the door harry looked at ron like he was crazy what and have her get mad at me do you have any idea how awful it is to fight with ginny at least you only have to hear her i feel it too ron paled at the thought bloody hell no wonder you two never fight we fight just not for very long corrected harry although compared to ron and hermione he supposed he and ginny hardly ever fought it hard to fight when you know exactly why the other person angry most of the time i think one of just needs to yell that got to be one of the wisest things i ve ever heard mumbled bill as ginny muffled yells could be heard you should see fleur when she gets going the veela in her really shows harry massaged his temples again does she get beaky asked george trying to use his hands to show a beak coming out of his face bill frowned at george before sighing yeah i suppose you could say that fred smiled mischief glinting in his eyes as he glanced toward tonks so tonks what happens when you get mad tonks narrowed her eyes and stared back at fred remus leaned over and whispered in harry ear watch this i dontsee you being all that scary added george you d probably just trip over something anyway tonks expression immediately became pained and her face morphed into that of mrs weasley oh really the twins paled their mother really did scare them change back fred said dramatically as both he and george covered their eyes with their fingers tonks laughed at them and changed back into her usual pink bubblegum hair appearance we donthave to ask ron what hermione is like when she angry commented george elbowing fred and winking everybody knows how you two get when you fight fred said i think ron here is the only one of us thick enough not to back down when he fights with his girlfriend chortled george hermione is not my girlfriend retorted ron his ears going red ah but that doesnt change the fact that you two fight only as married people can george continued on fred snickering behind him that enough boys said mr weasley speaking up for the first ron had his mouth open obviously wanting to retort but settled for glaring at his brothers who only grinned back at him speaking of hermione she will be arriving in a couple of days before harry birthday she been going nuts i ve got about a hundred letters from her in the past couple of weeks alone said ron with a hint of pride the twins looked like they wanted to comment but mr weasley silenced them with a hard look she been really worried about you harry why hasntshe written to me wondered harry aloud it was odd that he had not received a single letter from hermione she was normally a prolific writer ron fidgeted i guess she just assumed i would be talking to you the twins were now looking at harry pleading for him to tease ron i cantbe all she writes about what else does she have to say pressed harry who was rewarded with more fidgeting from ron you know hermione she worried about her o w l s and now she drawing up a schedule for n e w t s harry groaned at the announcement she keeps telling me i should be studying now that you re safe bit annoying really did she have anything to say about kent asked bill the attack on the county had been carried in the daily prophet she said it was awful and the muggle news was calling it a hurricane stated ron matter of factly bill shook his head did she mention her parents at all the oldest weasley son shared a look with his father that harry thought was strange oh yeah she wrote that they are really worried about this year and her going to hogwarts but she said they haventsaid she cantgo ron said quickly what going on harry asked bill bill looked at his father who nodded we think the attack on kent was just the beginning it was supposed to be his formal coming out attack spat bill vo voldemort was probably going to participate himself but your escape ruined his plans even without him though it was bad bill finished lamely how many giants asked ron three dumbledore said the aurors were holding them back but then the dementors showed supplied mr weasley you haventbeen out since they ve shown themselves there a persistent mist dumbledore says it is a sign that they re breeding harry shivered and felt goose bumps on his arms ron and the twins ran their hands over their arms probably to get rid of the feeling as well breeding the notion that dementors could breed was disturbing after all this is over i not sure how the ministry is going to control all of them now they were barely able to contain them on azkaban not that the spells were terribly effective in the end mr weasley frowned as he considered the problem i think i killed one harry said quietly what several voices said at once that supposed to be impossible bill said how asked george leaning in closer when i flamed it was standing so close that it got caught in the flames harry explained phoenix fire lupin muttered dementors dontlike fire maybe there is a reason for that fear we ll have to tell dumbledore is the mist all over britain asked ron a scared but thoughtful expression on his face bill nodded sadly and they are breeding in it bill and mr weasley shrugged something like that i going to write hermione ron said and headed off toward his room in the manor we are going to go down to the potions lab we are going back to the store tomorrow and we need to make some more stock our shield hats are backordered already said fred remus do you think we can go a little early to diagon alley asked harry the quaver in his voice betraying his hesitancy we really should talk to dumbledore first answered remus harry his irritation begin to prickle and forgetting that the dementors were no longer under ministry control said we shouldnthave to wait fudge might try to give sirius the kiss again just to show he doing something lupin held up his hands and positively growled i know i know the man turned to look at mr weasley tonks and bill tonks nodded immediately to the unasked question what do you think they might not be able to give him the kiss but they might just use the death chamber well there are four of us an auror a ministry employee a curse breaker and a defence professor i think we would make an adequate guard said bill mr weasley nodded at his son assessment why do you want to go early i sorry harry but you are bound to draw attention said mr weasley gravely harry blushed looked down and then mumbled i wanted to get rings for ginny and me lupin gave harry a warm smile and put a comforting hand on his shoulder that sounds like a good idea you couldntwear them though said mr weasley tacitly endorsing the idea maybe you should just wait i know but i was just thinking this morning that we really should have them even if we just wore them on chains or something said harry gaining more confidence from bill and mr weasleys lack of negative responses i thought they would be a good birthday present what type of rings asked remus i dontknow wedding rings he had not thought the idea through tonks laughed softly he means gold silver platinum stones no stones oh i dontknow i suppose gold is out of the question ginny doesntlike it supplied harry the issue had become far more complicated he just wanted a pair of rings well there white gold too tonks said as she took a seat next to him on the couch why dontyou tell us what you want and then remus and i can go out and get the rings asked tonks mr weasley nodded his head assenting to the idea not silver remus said with a definitive tone so either white gold or platinum bill smiled ruefully considering the amount of falls and scrapes you have harry i would suggest platinum at least for your ring white gold will probably be too soft any thoughts on stones i thought stones were for engagement rings harry said and rubbed his temples again his headache was becoming larger and even his scar was hurting a little well the larger ones are but you could put a few small ones in the wedding bands explained tonks almost knocking over the nearest lamp with her right hand does yours have any he asked mr weasley desperately trying to find dry ground no neither mine nor molly they are simple bands mr weasley said extending his left hand to show harry the gold band harry turned to lupin what about my parents no they did not either although james did give lily an impressive engagement ring i dontknow what ever became of it answered remus then i guess platinum rings what about sizes he was fairly certain that rings had to be sized uncle vernon had ranted about having to get his ring resized for a week once thinking of uncle vernon reminded him of aunt petunia he should ask how she was doing for the first time remus looked stumped but mr weasley answered the rings will magically size to your finger okay so platinum rings do you want anything engraved queried tonks in an excited tone a date or phrase harry bit his lower lip in thought a habit he had picked up from ginny yeah 1 september 1991 and umm he knew there should be an engraving but it had to be right something simple but meaningful and engraved with when my soul found its mate that sweet harry came ginny curious voice even her mental voice sounded a little raw from yelling so much for surprising you you like the idea asked harry feeling nervous you know i do but arentwe doing this backwards shouldntthe engagement ring be first ginny joked no sense in an engagement ring we were never engaged how about a coming out ring i wasntserious i only need the one ring ginny said backtracking i am and you can pick it out harry shuddered picking out a simple band had been bad enough several hours later harry and ginny ron had disappeared again were waiting with mr and mrs weasley for tonks and remus to return mrs weasley shifted her weight to her right leg i hope nothing happened to them i sure they re fine reassured mr weasley she wants to say we shouldntgo ginny said with a hint of accomplishment harry smirked because it isnt safe i suppose we got a little carried away ginny admitted reluctantly a little yes a little besides it has its benefits mum isntsaying anything about us going to diagon alley this time there was no mistaking the pride are you sure you should go harry instantly felt ginny anger rise if i not going to let mum baby me then what makes you think i going to let you she demanded i not trying to baby you and you know it harry felt his own anger rise he was just as tired as ginny was of people telling him what he could or could not do i not going to fight with you harry i ve had enough of fighting today but i going i just dontsee why you should take unnecessary risks i have to go you don t pleaded harry hoping she would not blow up at him unnecessary risks you sound like mum i still going ginny said firmly why questioned harry knowing that there was nothing he could do to stop her short of stunning her because the last time i let you go off by yourself you ended up captured by death eaters harry pulled her into a hug and ginny embraced him tightly i not losing you she whispered must have been quite a conversation noted mr weasley quietly to mrs weasley who looked on the pair with an expression of realisation and regretful understanding remus and tonks walked in through the door at that moment accompanied by bill and ding remus walked over and handed harry a small bag without a word causing harry to smile almost shyly at ginny how are we going to the leaky cauldron asked harry we ll go to grimmauld place first and then take a car answered mr weasley so if you are ready ding can you put this on the desk in the master bedroom the small house elf bobbed his head excitedly before taking the bag the drive to charring cross road was an alarming ride mundungus fletcher was driving and his driving was just like his business dealings shady he made questionable turns cut off other drivers never touched his signals and drove at breakneck speed they made it to the leaky cauldron with time to spare and mundungus parked the car illegally in a disabled space he remained in the car saying that he had other business to attend to in london but he would be back well before they would be done tonks and remus entered the leaky cauldron first scouting for any potential dangers while mr weasley and bill stayed outside with harry and ginny they followed after a few seconds and tom the toothless barkeep led them into a private backroom where rita skeeter was waiting tonks waved her wand muttering a privacy spell the reporter looked remarkably better than the last time they had seen her her hair was styled nails even and reflective and she had new though still rather revolting glasses harry she cried standing and extending her hand which harry shook reluctantly how good it is to see you again is this really necessary she asked waving at the four adults and ginny when harry only frowned at her rita eyebrows rose slightly and a familiar gleam lit in her eyes the rumors are true then what rumors asked harry before he could stop himself he knew she had to be baiting him that you were captured by you know who rita practically whispered let talk about sirius black said ginny forcibly when she felt harry stiffen i see that you are still dating virginia rita said frowning at ginny it ginevra and yes but we are here to talk about sirius harry said quickly trying to keep his annoyance under control there was something about rita skeeter that made his skin crawl very well it did not take long for rita to become completely focused on the story harry had to tell she particularly paid close attention to the end of harry third year are you saying that the minister knew sirius black was innocent then she asked her quick quills positively vibrating yes we told fudge that it was pettigrew the entire time but he refused to believe us reiterated harry for perhaps the third time you say mr black never received a trial or was questioned under veritaserum rita asked neither grunted harry rita smile was truly predatory i think i ve got all i need it was a pleasure doing business with you again harry rita said gathering her parchment together she stopped mid shuffle and looked at harry questioningly i donthave to write this for free do i no just make sure it accurate harry emphasised the word accurate giving her trademark smile rita answered i wouldntdream of doing anything else truth is so much better than fiction as an afterthough she added in this case harry rubbed his forehead as they watched rita leave the leaky cauldron let get out of here ginny took his hand and then asked how long has your scar been hurting i think since this morning it not bad though shrugged harry frowns greeting his statement dumbledore clutched his right forearm as he slowly walked through the gates leading into hogwarts making his way slowly to the hospital wing he had sent fawkes ahead warning pomfrey and severus to prepare for his arrival traveling by fire did not appeal to his injured arm the great doors leading to the entrance hall opened as he approached them and he immediately turned toward the hospital wing dumbledore had expected the horcrux to react violently to being destroyed but he had not anticipated the sheer power of it it had almost cost him his life he had been extremely lucky to isolate the damage to his right arm dumbledore winced as pain shot through his arm when he accidentally moved it despite the pain he was in now several important questions had been answered first voldemort had guarded his horcruxes well which led to the second answer there were indeed horcruxes not just a horcrux dumbledore had been hoping he knew it was unlikely but he had held out hope nonetheless that the diary had been the only horcrux perhaps the most important thing he had discovered though was what happened after you destroyed a horcrux previously he had read that the foul creations reacted violently often killing the one who performed the charm to destroy them dumbledore knew without a doubt that if it had been any other wizard other than himself who had performed the charm they would surely be dead well any other wizard except himself and harry potter harry had already destroyed one horcrux with no ill effects at first dumbledore had not thought much about it but now the prophecy seemed to make more sense harry was probably the only wizard who could destroy the horcruxes without dying himself dumbledore was not sure he could destroy another one without sacrificing his own life oh albus what have you done exclaimed madam pomfrey rushing over toward him wand drawn and already casting several diagnostic charms sit down here she said forcing him down on the nearest cot i ve got the potions ready and severus will be here shortly she said as she bustled around after two hours several putrid tasting potions and plenty of clucking from madam pomfrey dumbledore was back in his office sitting at his desk with severus snape sitting before him what is voldemort condition inquired dumbledore ignoring snape curious looks at his blackened hand angry very angry snape said with a shiver he was burned badly from whatever the weasley girl did then last night he collapsed in the middle of a meeting screaming dumbledore eyes twinkled at the news so the connection works in both directions interesting snape frowned at his words it would appear so the dark lord has reinforced his occlumency walls he determined not to let potter into his mind again he has not taken the last few days well snape sneer almost became a smile lucius has been tortured most severely really inquired dumbledore leaning forward malfoy was the only death eater other than bellatrix who had escaped from the attack on the ministry dumbledore was still not sure how the slippery malfoy had done it but he suspected a secret passageway in the ministry had allowed him to slip away when he realised he was outnumbered yes the dark lord wanted to know more about the weasley girl and he found out about the chamber of secrets snape said he became enraged when malfoy told him the diary had been destroyed he did not know before asked dumbledore no he was focused the entire time on obtaining the prophecy snape paused he has been most severe with lucius i imagine he would be has he found out anything else about ms weasley snape sneered the dark lord was very interested in her relationship with potter he said something about it all making sense now he did not elaborate speaking of harry did you ever see him while he was captured dumbledore eyes had ceased twinkling snape looked directly into dumbledore cool blue eyes no i never saw him do you know how he found out about emmeline dumbledore said a pained expression crossing his face the rest of the order had not yet been informed about her unfortunate death she was killed by bellatrix but i dontknow how he knew where she was the two men remained quiet for several moments he planning on something big soon something to do with that snake the way snape said snake left no doubt that the man did not like the creature bigger than kent dumbledore asked warily snape shrugged and silence reigned for another couple of minutes have you found a new defence professor snape asked his ambition clearly written on his face no not yet answered dumbledore i think it is time i turned in dumbledore finally said as he removed his pocket watch and flipped it open the smallest hand had moved a couple of notches things are coming to a head noted dumbledore and closed the watch with a snap there was a lot to do harry walked downstairs to the kitchen with a spring in his step and a comforting weight around his neck remus and tonks had gotten the rings and ginny and he had exchanged them in private putting them only for the night now his ring was draped around his neck on a chain remus had bought along with the rings harry smiled the ring felt good it also helped that he had a birthday present for ginny granted he did not know what it was but that just meant that she could not find out either harry pushed the door open to the kitchen and froze sitting at the table reading the daily prophet was professor dumbledore harry wondered how the headmaster was going to react to him going out and giving an interview dumbledore folded the paper and gave harry a small smile sit down harry i see you had a busy day yesterday too harry took a double take at dumbledore when he saw the blackened form of the headmaster right hand dumbledore raised the hand and then put it below the table dontworry about this harry we will discuss it later i think you want to see this first dumbledore pushed the prophet across the table ms skeeter is a very witty writer wow harry stated breathlessly as he looked down at the front page across the top next to an old photo of sirius was the headline boy who lived claims sirius black innocent fudge in denial then below the main headline was another in smaller font ministry ignored laws in black imprisonment trial what trial and then black helps capture death eaters see page 8 according to my sources there will be a vote of no confidence today or tomorrow dumbledore chuckled i daresay that sirius will be free by tonight with the amount of pressure this article will put on fudge good harry said a plate was placed in front of him with all of his favorite breakfast foods he turned his head swiftly to see dinny stepping back he had not even noticed the elf when he came in thanks dinny a plate had also been placed in front of the headmaster harry took a few bites of food before talking again how aunt petunia it felt very strange to be talking to professor dumbledore over breakfast even stranger to talk about his aunt dumbledore chewed his eggs and swallowed not well she has not regained consciousness he paused a moment his next sentence was said grimly the healers do not expect her to live too much longer harry pushed the food on his plate around with his fork contradictory emotions were warring within him he did not love aunt petunia but he did not hate her dislike perhaps but not hate she was the last blood relative he had and that thought made him feel very alone what would this be like without ginny can i see her he asked of course i ll arrange a trip for tomorrow answered dumbledore when will we know about sirius harry asked i suspect very soon fudge will want to show he is doing something or a least correcting old mistakes dumbledore peered into harry eyes as trying to judge something harry remus said your scar hurt yesterday not bad just a dull ache replied harry a little defensively it not like you would expect voldemort not to be mad dumbledore chuckled no i suppose not but do you know why he mad because i escaped and ginny hurt him harry bluntly said shaking his head slightly dumbledore eyes twinkled harry what were you doing two nights ago harry eyes grew wide and he blushed before looking down at his plate dumbledore took it as an answer very well have you considered that your link with lord voldemort works both ways what harry felt anger and fear start to rise which was then followed quickly by disgust you mean he was watching no from what you have already told me about your capture i do not believe voldemort could ever reside within you without severe consequences when voldemort relaxes his guard you can feel when he is angry through your scar it hurts does it not dumbledore was speaking slowly harry nodded voldemort cannot understand or abide love that was the reason why he could not touch you in your first year why your mind is closed to him and why when your love for ginny reaches a dumbledore smile widened and he added emphasis on the next word climax it hurts him harry eyes grew into saucers you mean when ginny and i when we i mean dumbledore beard twitched it causes him pain no sound entered the kitchen as harry slowly allowed what dumbledore was saying to sink in he smiled so all we have to do to cause him pain is to this time dumbledore chuckled i daresay that he will take precautions so that it cannot happen again oh harry said not knowing whether to be relieved or disappointed this is not the only thing i wanted to discuss with you when term starts i would like you to meet with me periodically we have much to discuss and i have much to teach you dumbledore said with a strange look in his eyes what about ginny she may join us if she desires answered dumbledore harry nodded after yesterday he knew ginny would not only want to but demand to be a part of whatever dumbledore wanted to teach him excuse me master harry came bonny timid high pitched voice you have a letter so do you professor dumbledore sir she handed them their letters and then poured harry a glass of juice and dumbledore a cup of tea before leaving harry looked at the letter questioningly and flipped it over the seal of the minister of magic was on it he glanced at dumbledore this was much quicker than expected cornelius must be far more desperate than i thought without another word dumbledore opened his letter and harry followed his example ginny wake up harry screamed mentally his face actually hurt from the size of his smile dumbledore too looked relieved and happy perhaps we should go to st mungo today instead of tomorrow a week had passed since sirius pardon and the vote of no confidence that had occurred the following day dumbledore smiled in remembrance the daily prophet and the letters that had brought the news were now framed sirius had hung his copy of the prophet next to the scorch mark that had been his mother painting sirius had proudly proclaimed two of the happiest moments of my life are represented on this wall now first when i was finally rid of my detestable mother second when i became a truly free man sirius had become an instant celebrity in two days he had received no less than seventy eight marriage offers when the daily prophet in another rita skeeter exclusive revealed that sirius black was also harry potter godfather he had been forced to arrange for owls to deliver to a postal box rather than directly to him for a few hours grimmauld place had been besieged by many owls all vying for the sole position of his attention he had held a large raucous party at grimmauld place for the entire order it had distracted them temporarily from voldemort and his death eaters dumbledore had been painfully reminded of another gathering much like it in early 1980 to celebrate the upcoming births of harry and neville a photograph had been taken at that one too the jovial aftereffects of the party were now gone dumbledore forced his emotions to the side there would be a time for tears but it was later amelia bones was dead fudge had called on him immediately when aurors had found the dark mark floating above her home amelia had been a tough but fair old woman she had also been fudge assumed successor after the vote of no confidence the house bore the telltale signs of a fight amelia had not gone quietly voldemort himself had killed her dumbledore was sure of it the newspapers would describe her killing as nasty nasty had become the adjective attached to the most brutal of the death eaters killings in the last war they had also described emmeline as nasty at least hestia body had not been mutilated dumbledore sighed and continued examining the area around the covered body the room was still highly charged with residual magic this fact more than the mutilation of the body bothered dumbledore greatly the magic should have dissipated no matter what curses were cast the hairs on the back of his neck were still standing on end few things could cause it to linger for so long few of those pleasant a soul bond was one dumbledore smiled at that thought there was still a strong positive residual magic lingering at the entrance to platform nine and three quarters even after years had passed dumbledore imagined that creating a horcrux also left a lot of residual magic after what severus had told him dumbledore feared this to be the case voldemort would want to replace the diary this was not a heartening thought if voldemort could continue to replace horcruxes then the war would be very very long he needed to speak with severus an hour later he was back in his office with severus snape i want to know about madam bones death severus remained quite for a couple minutes to collect his thoughts dumbledore did not rush him the dark lord ordered us to secure the outside of the house and made it clear that anyone who disturbed him would be dealt with severely then he went in by himself there were quite a few spells before she died we must have waited half an hour before he came out after amelia death clarified dumbledore yes he was just as angry as when potter escaped what do you mean questioned dumbledore he was cursing potter he said that it was his fault snape explained shuddering at the memory dumbledore expression intensified do you know what he tried to do snape gripped the arm of the chair tighter before answering i dontknow some kind of ritual i know he has been preparing for it ever since potter escaped he asked me to brew him an enhanced pepper up potion before the attack dumbledore frowned you dontknow what he tried to do then defense defence no the dark lord does not trust me completely snape said as if it explained everything i suppose not did lord voldemort require your potion asked dumbledore snape flinched at the dark lord name the dark lord did not snape paused and then asked a question of his own have you found a defence professor not yet severus rest assured that when i find one you will be the first to know dumbledore said tiredly my services are always available snape responded silkily thank you for offering again i will inform you if i require your services said dumbledore clearly signifying that the meeting was over when snape had closed the door behind him dumbledore opened his pocket watch again and cringed as he looked at his blackened hand it was time to take another potion he would definitely not be attempting to destroy any more horcruxes besides he now had a more pressing matter finding a new defence professor perhaps severus is right it might be easier to find a potions professor than a defence professor dumbledore mulled the matter over there were few qualified potion masters available and only one that would probably be willing to teach an hour later dumbledore walked into grimmauld place an order meeting would be taking place that night he sighed horace slughorn had gone into hiding the man was an excellent potions master and had all the necessary credentials to teach had even taught at hogwarts before but dumbledore supposed it was probably better that he had not been able to find him slughorn was a true slytherin if nothing else while dumbledore would welcome his skill and cleverness the other qualities were not so desirable now slughorn was not biased by blood but by power he was ambitious and crafty to a fault dumbledore had never approved of his networking of the students the gryffindor in him found it distasteful which left him with the problem of a still open defence professor slot he exited the hallway into the sitting room sirius was sitting in a plush and newly purchased armchair twirling his wand dumbledore smiled and his eyes twinkled severus was not going to like this a n yes i not dead i am still working on fate debt to prove it here is a portion of what was supposed to be chapter 27 unnamed as i started editing i quickly realized that i needed to readjust where the story was going i ve now reached the point in the editing ootp where these changes are going to happen and will impact the summer of fifth year and beyond that said it is all mapped out however i thought some might like to see where what i had this has not been edited or even reread so what you see is what you get i going to apologize now for the wait i going to devote more time to the story but i had enormous amounts of free time when i started and it is a hobby something to do to relieve stress and the such as i said when i started i fully intend to finish it i think everyone will greatly enjoy much of what is planned but it will take me awhile to get there sorry chapter 27 the newspaper skidded off the stones of the fire place before falling into the fire the paper quickly blackened and disappeared in the flames the daily prophet was almost as frustrating as it had been the previous year when it had been reporting that he was nutters harry sighed and ran his fingers through his already messy hair voldemort was becoming more powerful it seemed that every morning the paper brought more news of death eater or dementor attacks the only bright spot over the summer had been sirius full pardon since then it had only been bad news first news came of a large dementor attack upon a small village almost thirty people now had the soulless eyes that resulted from a dementor kiss harry shuddered as he thought about those people unfortunately it had not stopped there just last week death eaters had attacked a bridge bringing the structure down harry did not know the final death tally from that attack but knew it had to be large a special election followed the dementor attack cornelius fudge was replaced and relegated to muggle relations from what sirius told harry the order of the phoenix was wary of fudge replacement rufus scrimgeour the former head of the auror division and a former auror himself despite his background scrimgeour was known for his bullheadedness ruthlessness and political astuteness harry wanted to learn more about the new minister of magic but sirius lupin and even the elder weasleys were mostly gone on order business he had learned that under fudge the auror division and magic law enforcement department as a whole suffered large budget constraints and had atrophied one of scrimgeour first actions was to call for a new budget one that emphasized security unfortunately the ministry remained largely reactionary to voldemort and his death eaters additional security was in place around diagon alley st mungo s and the ministry but the order reported that the ministry was not trying to find the death eaters even with scrimgeour budget it would take time for new aurors to be trained the most it had done was issue security pamphlets harry sighed and closed his eyes the fire crackled providing the only light in the study he could faintly hear crickets chirping trying to lull him to sleep potter manor was a sanctuary a shelter in the growing storm but even surrounded by the manor tranquil atmosphere a great weight was building on his shoulders no matter how he thought about it he came to the same conclusion voldemort was his responsibility the prophecy said as much a more tangible weight pressed down on both his shoulders ginny hands tightened and massaged forcing the tension to leave enough harry i cantstop thinking about all those people that he killing harry confessed the prophecy said ginny walked around the chair harry was sitting in and she lowered herself onto harry lap she placed her hands and his chest and pushed him deeper into the chair listen to me i dontcare what some stupid prophecy says voldemort is not your responsibility i have to fight him though he going to keep killing until i face him protested harry ginny leaned her head against his shoulder and harry arms encircled her what will happen if you face him now her thoughts trembled in his head but she pressed on if you try and face him now you will die ginny paused a moment to allow her words to sink in she cuddled closer to him before adding i couldntlive without you harry ran his left hand through her hair nor i without you several minutes passed and ginny breathing had become deep she was asleep he tightened his grip on her before allowing sleep to take him a loud thumping woke both harry and ginny a very excited voice joined the thumping harry ginny wake up wake up harry blinked awake and began moving his stiff muscles ginny however buried her head deeper into the crook of his neck and mumbled i going to kill ron open up ron yelled again this had better be good muttered ginny as she slid of harry lap and stretched harry pushed himself off the chair and joined ginny in stretching the chair had seemed comfortable at the time but now his muscles ached come on ron yelled again his voice changed in tone slightly what are you two doing anyway harry walked to the door and opened it to reveal ron smiling face he pushed by harry and moved to the middle of the den i did it i finally did it he crowed to the confusion of ginny and harry ginny gave harry an annoyed look laced with confusion she really did like to sleep in just show them ron commanded hermione voice from the doorway she stepped across the threshold and closed the door she gave the three of them a very self satisfied smile and motioned to ron to get on with it when harry turned his gaze back to ron he did not see ron but a lion its coat was golden but creature mane was the same shade of red as ron hair congratulations mate harry said ron turned in a circle proudly displaying his new form great job ron added ginny causing the lion to give a low roar of thanks ron transformed back into himself and after panting for a few seconds said it amazing i can only hold it for a minute but still ron trailed off clearly at a loss for words i ve never seen him try so hard at something hermione noted ron blushed at the compliment i never could have done it without your help harry looked between ron and hermione are they flirting harry cocked eyebrow at ginny the only feeling he was receiving from her was astonishment ginny sorry it just that they are flirting without bickering i never thought i d see the day harry coughed how your potion coming it almost done it just has to simmer for the next few months hermione forehead scrunched i hope i have a form you will ron reassured quickly harry and ginny nodded their agreement hermione did not look convinced not everyone has an animagus form ron stomach grumbled loudly causing both the girls to roll their eyes and harry laugh hermione said we need to have breakfast soon anyway the funeral is at ten cold ice settled in harry stomach how could i forget ginny hand began rubbing his back aunt petunia had died a few days ago harry did not know who was in charge of the funeral arrangements but he suspected dumbledore hand loneliness settled onto harry aunt petunia may have been a bitter woman who harbored little if any love for him but she was the last of his family how could i forget ginny hand stopped moving and gripped his shoulder tightly you re not alone across from them hermione noticed harry discomfort i so sorry harry that was callous ron looked at hermione confusedly but harry waved her off dontworry about it you re right though we need to eat now or we ll be late to a funeral breakfast was a somber affair no adults were in the house and they ate quietly hermione was the first to break the silence we should put on our clothes no one argued with the statement until they were at the foot of the stairs er what clothes asked ron all i ve got are robes are you saying that you donthave anything suitable for a muggle funeral snapped hermione why the bloody hell would i argued ron hermione huffed and was about to retort when bonny appeared there is no need to argue appropriate attire for you both can be found come i just need your measurements i ve have a black dress hermione said she was still uncomfortable with having the house elves serve her i know but you will be wanting something else bonny informed her the diminutive elf wasted no more time and gently put a hand on their backs come come no time for fussing after ron and hermione were out of earshot harry raised an eyebrow sometimes i wonder who the master and the servant really are ginny gave a small laugh the house elves with the exception of ding did treat them like children they continued their journey to the master suite they were met be corfy i have prepared your clothes corfy waved a hand toward the bedroom you do not have much time master dumbledore left word that you are to be ready by ten thirty you talked to dumbledore harry asked he had a lot of questions for dumbledore but he was around even less than sirius corfy nodded yes he wanted you to be ready by ten but i assured him that ten thirty was a more reasonable time he will arrive then to transport you to the funeral what about my parents mistress parents are helping organize security corfy answered as he led them into the bedroom your older brothers are also providing assistance i believe he spotted a piece of lint on harry jacket and picked it off however ginny eyes were wide with fright my brothers she said stiltedly what are fred and george doing corfy eyes held amusement it is my understanding that your mother was stopping by their shop before continuing on ginny sighed in relief if you have need of me just call corfy snapped his fingers and disappeared harry pulled at his collar it was the first time he had ever worn a tie and he found the sensation constricting he paced in front of the fireplace dumbledore would be there any minute to take them to the funeral the more he thought about it the more nervous he became what if aunt marge was there there certainly wasnta reason for her not to be there and dumbledore would have notified her harry sighed and fiddled with his tie a hand sharply slapped his stop messing with your ginny took a moment to find the word tie everything will be fine you donthave to say a word and all of us will be there sirius will be on your right and i ll be on your left the door to the welcoming den opened see why i should have to wear this ron protested as he loosened his tie it makes you look dignified replied a perturbed looking hermione she was red in the face and ron ears were flaming they must have been arguing all the way to the den she grabbed ron by the shoulders and roughly tightened his tie and dontyou dare unbutton the top button ron gave harry and ginny a despairing look shifting from foot to foot and giving hermione worried glances ron finally said i hungry i ll just nip over to the kitchen no you re not eating you ll get food on your clothes hermione said as she sat in the nearest chair i dontsee why we should have to go it not like we liked the bat he mumbled hermione did not even turn her head we ve already been over this ron frowned in defeat err hermione ron leaned in toward her hermione looked up sharply what is it now you ve got a piece of something on your dress hermione eyes widened and she opened her mouth to apologize i ll get it ron quickly said as he lifted a white thread from her shoulder sorry i didntmean to snap it my fault ron assured her no it not hermione insisted yes it is if i hadnt i shouldnthave snapped though interrupted hermione ron opened his mouth to retort and harry tuned them out are they actually arguing about arguing harry asked perplexed as they continued to banter back and forth ginny shrugged the fire glowed green and professor dumbledore stepped from the fire he was in his usual purple robes ron and hermione stopped arguing at his arrival dumbledore surveyed each of them good you are all ready then no one responded but dumbledore assumed the affirmative and pulled a decrepit boot from his robe take a hold on this sirius will have the portkey for your return your not coming professor harry asked dumbledore put his left hand on harry shoulder forcing harry to look into his eyes i afraid i have other obligations dumbledore eyes did not twinkle and for the first time since harry had known the man dark circles lined his eyes he not sleeping harry realized he was not the only one feeling the impact of the news the daily prophet brought every morning in five seconds dumbledore announced as they all grabbed the boot or not sleeping well added ginny as she too examined the headmaster lined face he not looking well four everyone depends on him harry again thought of the paper and what it must be like to be looked upon not as the savior of the wizarding world but as its champion he was glad it was dumbledore they turned to and not him three both he and ginny shivered as they considered what would happen if the prophet ever found out about the prophecy two it was destroyed no one can find out harry reassured himself one and we re not going to tell anyone ginny said emphatically the portkey activated harry turned to ginny am i wrong to feel relieved they were sitting alone in the master bedroom the door ajar the rest of the weasley family had given them space even mrs weasley had only asked harry three times if he wanted anything to eat before going quiet the funeral had been a quick affair not one muggle attended he knew at least marge dursley harry refused to call her aunt had been contacted but she had stayed away ginny arm wrapped around harry shoulder her hand began softly massaging no the firm simple word did more for harry than any explanation could have the self loathing caused by his relief faded it was replaced with a sense of calmness for the first time harry felt like he saw what lay before him the dangers and the opportunities he took a deep breath it all coming to a head ginny raised her head and her eyes met his she offered no argument she felt harry words were true and it made her shiver we have to prepare harry nodded sirius and remus are dueling with us already this was only partially true sirius and remus did duel with all four of them when they had the time unfortunately the two old marauders had little time but how do we kill him ginny asked how do i kill him harry corrected her we ginny nails dug into his shoulder daring him to contradict her we cantbe sure the avada kedavra curse will work or that we could cast it we should ask hermione she ll research it to death ginny shook her head there nothing to research no one has ever survived the curse except you and voldemort no one knows what kind of effect the curse would have when it rebounded harry mind mulled ginny words moody had told them the avada kedavra killed without leaving a mark on the body it sounded like it destroyed the soul the soul the soul had to be the key maybe the rebounded curse only destroyed the body ginny said voicing harry thoughts shouldnthe be a ghost then maybe we should ask headless nick he might know ginny leaned her head against his shoulder i guess we do have something for hermione to research dumbledore knuckles hung just off the door prepared to knock he had come to check on harry instead he had inadvertently overheard the last bit of their conversation the two were very close to the truth he made his decision and knocked harry ginny he gave them a few moments excuse me but i wanted to talk with you do you want me to leave professor ginny asked dumbledore mad a dismissive gesture with his hand no that would be unnecessary may i he gestured to an empty chair of course dumbledore sat this has not been the easiest of summers for you harry harry and ginny exchanged a quick look before harry grunted dumbledore restrained a smile at their mental communication their relationship buoyed his hopes he highly doubted harry would look as good as he did now without ginny influence and constant presence still he needed to make sure harry was talking about the events of this very traumatic summer how are you coping harry lowered his head for several seconds and he saw ginny give him a nudge i fine another nudge i dontlike small spaces he admitted dumbledore tired to keep his face clear of emotions to hide the anger that threatened to show they kept you in a small cell harry nodded mostly chained to a rack his teeth grinded but he forced himself to take a breath you were drugged as well harry nodded again did it interfere with your link to ginny another nod how did you manage i listened to the phoenix the phoenix dumbledore tried to form his thoughts into a coherent whole he had not been expecting an answer most animagus acquired traits of their animal forms even when not transformed some even felt traces of their animal instincts but this seemed different you can hear your animagus form harry eyes rose from the floor i could here the phoenix song it gave me something to focus on when i couldntfeel ginny have you ever felt the phoenix before then dumbledore leaned forward this had not been the topic he had planned on discussing but it now seemed vitally important yeah during the second task harry smiled at the memory it didntlike the idea of submerging in water not able to resist dumbledore chuckled i would imagine that a phoenix wouldntlike being submerged in water what about the panther harry did a double take how did you i try to be aware of most things now about the panther harry considered the question i didntfeel anything from the panther i mean i dontthink i ve ever felt the panther like the phoenix what about you mrs potter ginny colored a little at the address and dumbledore smirked beneath his beard have you felt either the phoenix or the panther like harry has not the phoenix but i occasionally feel the panther especially when i angry that does settle that matter then what matter ginny asked your two forms yours is the panther while harry is the phoenix your bond allows you to share forms but you still have a stronger link to your your native form dumbledore allowed them a few moments before continuing your forms suit you is this the power he knows not harry asked dumbledore sighed at the hope in harry eyes no voldemort knows about you being an animagus and he is intimately familiar with the powers of an animagus but your form harry does give you advantages against him indeed it already has what they said together your blood harry do you remember telling me that voldemort believed your blood was poisonous to him harry nodded it was not because of the bond at least i do not think so although i did entertain the thought at the time your connection to the phoenix would have been just as intolerable as ginny love and even more apparent to voldemort why would that make harry blood poisonous very good dumbledore said automatically reverting to his professor mode the phoenix is enemies with few creatures he paused a moment deciding on the best approach you can speak with fawkes harry yes even when you are not transformed well i dontknow i dontthink i ve ever tried dumbledore chuckled you should i think you will find that you can understand fawkes but back to the original point what animals can lord voldemort speak to harry eyes widened snakes yes he is not a parselmouth simply because he is slytherin heir it matches his form well he watched harry and ginny faces paled and answered the unasked question basilisk harry put his arm around ginny whose freckles now stood out livid against her pale skin a basilisk yes tom riddle mastered the animagus transformation shortly after left hogwarts he used it several times while in albania to terrorize several villages dumbledore said sadly he has not used it since thankfully just when i thought voldemort couldntget any worse now he can kill people with a look harry said despair and morbid humor laced in his voice does this mean we can kill him with a rooster ginny asked and then giggled could you imagine it the dark lord killed by a chicken harry and professor dumbledore joined her laughter would that work harry asked dumbledore sobered immediately at least not in his human form his lips pursed causing his beard to waggle i ve tried it twice the usual twinkle returned to the headmaster eyes do you have any idea how hard it is to get a rooster to crow in the middle of the night while surrounded by death eaters harry and ginny immediately began laughing not a task for the faint of heart i dontthink i want to try that approach harry said between bursts of laughter there got to be a better way the laughter died in dumbledore eyes it is one of the subjects we must discuss soon he raised a hand to forestall any questions there are still a few things to wrap up before i discuss them with you but it will be soon for now there are a couple things to discuss first you should know that tonks and sirius will accompany you on the train the ministry will have several aurors on the platform dumbledore sighed he was worried the minister might use the situation to try and approach harry many parents have expressed concern about security at the platform and the ministry needs to demonstrate it is taking security seriously the minister may also be present he may try to talk to you he paused to take a breath he has expressed a desire for you to express your support for the ministry harry pinched the bridge of his nose and frowned at ginny who looked directly into his eyes and scornfully said it a media event then i afraid so attacking the platform is not voldemort style but he may still try and harm you through other means which is why sirius and tonks will both be nearby if you sense any danger use your animagus abilities to escape do not wait dumbledore sensed they were about to protest the others will be safe much of the order is ready to respond but we can protect everyone easier if you are not there we can help determination showed in every line of harry face dumbledore shifted his gaze so that he looked directly into harry eyes you could but then you would be the order primary responsibility not protecting the rest of the train harry and ginny deflated before his eyes surrendering to the logic of the situation he reached into his coat pocket and extracted two envelopes i have something that should distract you he handed them the envelopes i understand you both did quite well it will be a challenge picking only five o w l s harry and ginny had forgotten about them indeed dumbledore eyes twinkled miss granger should be receiving hers shortly please inform her that five classes is the recommended class load and that seven is the maximum number i not doing it ginny protested immediately harry glared at ginny and then looked down at the envelope in his hands er it does say that in the letter pausing a moment before answering dumbledore said of course but remind her nevertheless when choosing your courses remember to pick the classes best suited to your career goals harry and ginny nodded very good would you like a lemon drop they shook their heads dumbledore sighed no one ever took the lemon drops he unwrapped one and popped it into his mouth ginny harry the letters are here the letters are here hermione screamed ron muffled voice followed blimey hermione that was my ear harry and ginny paused on the stairway and exchanged amused glances oh hush ron hermione voice increased in volume harry ginny where are you they walled the few more steps into view hermione grinned brilliantly and gently bobbed on heels well ginny smiled wickedly time to have a little fun you can be just a little evil harry intoned with a grin well what are you talking about ginny face was a mask of innocence hermione jaw dropped she closed her mouth and blinked several times and then said very slowly our o w l s just arrived do you have yours oh ginny shrugged and took several strides toward the dining room how did you do she said uninterestedly ron are you hungry ron stared at ginny then his eyes darted to hermione um i want to see how i did first ginny mask fell are you serious harry could not help it and let out a snicker did ron really say that thank you ron hermione smiled at him but we can open our letters after supper really ron asked hopefully what harry ejaculated are you serious ginny repeated hermione blushed and smiled softly her eyes darting to ron i sure we re all hungry and a few more minutes is not going to change our scores a n this is the first part of chapter 3 i ve decided to split it up since it was just getting way to long i ve written a 2500 words of the next part i planing on putting in more action adventure once poa is done the outlines for gof and ootp are certainly more exciting besides even fluff has an upper limit if you notice some errors with the times that certain events happen or placement of hogsmeade weekends or whatever that is completely my fault i didnthave the motivation to map that out and i working without access to the books at the moment as i in the process of moving speaking of which i dont know when the next update will be i move on the 14th so i not sure when i will get the internet up and working or how much time i will have to write that and i just might have to read hbp i inserted sirius attack on the fat lady on halloween i realized i had missed it warning at the end of this chapter there may be a couple paragraphs actually more like two sentences that might be considered mature i not exactly sure how far each rating extends but you have seen worse on pg 13 films much worse on r and i know i ve heard worse when i was in middle school not to mention high school it will be separated by so you know where it ends it does not add too much to the overall story except setting up something for the summer probably not what you think which will able to be understood without reading the last few paragraphs it is only foreshadowing disclaimer what do you think see chapter 1 chapter 3 the prisoner of azkaban part i the dursleys surveyed the harry and ginny uncle vernon face was patchy red revealing his irritation dudley was looking at ginny with a strange expression that harry didntlike he shifted slightly shielding ginny from dudley aunt petunia expression was different altogether she looked pale and shocked harry took a deep steadying breath uncle vernon aunt petunia dudley this is ginny ginny this is the dursleys ginny smiled and extended her hand like her mother had taught her to aunt petunia took it absently but dudley just looked on and uncle vernon sneered come boy we dont have all day we ve already wasted time getting you uncle vernon seemed to be adapting to ginny presence by ignoring her harry gave a mental shrug and followed the dursleys back to the car harry and ginny wedged their trunks into the boot harry got into the car first so that ginny wouldnthave to sit near dudley arriving at number 4 harry and ginny moved their trunks into harry small room ginny was wide eyed staring at all the muggle contraptions dad would be in heaven with all these plugs and everything runs on elek trisity yep electricity answered harry harry was surprised when the dursleys had automatically set a place for ginny for dinner without any fuss they even allowed her to have seconds as they moved to retire for the night they met dudley on the stairs she sleeping in your room he sounded incredulous yes harry replied trying to keep things civil with his cousin but there only one bed in there dudley protested harry looked at dudley is that jealousy we only need one dudley stared and harry and ginny pushed past him after using the bathroom harry took ginny hand and led her to bed the sun woke harry the next morning he had had the best sleep in his life at privet drive he heard the dursleys beginning to wake and realized he needed to get up he nudged ginny who only snuggled closer and muttered something that sounded like five more minutes harry laughed he knew ginny was slow to wake he nudged her again this time in the ribs and she squirmed surprised by this reaction he repeated it soon he realized she was ticklish and began attacking her ginny was awake quickly and then attacked him harry had never been tickled before and now ginny hands were like blurs he was completely at her mercy and soon found himself pinned below her so do you surrender harry she smiled impishly happy with herself harry nodded gasping for breath i need to go down make breakfast harry rushed down stairs still in his pajamas and started breakfast hoping the dursleys were still going to be civil harry made eggs toast and bacon and carefully placed the dishes on the table the dursleys were at the table and ginny soon joined them after breakfast an almost completely quiet affair harry began cleaning up and ginny helped him with the dishes she was fascinated with the dishwasher once they were done she grabbed harry come on harry get dressed i want to go to the park today harry quickly changed and left the house before he could be ordered to do any chores they reached the park and harry and ginny found the swings they spent most of the day exploring the park harry showed ginny all of his hiding spots they used one alcove of trees to begin practicing their animagus forms returning to privet drive before dinner harry gave ginny a piggyback ride back ginny laughed hysterically the entire way they entered number 4 smiling ear to ear when uncle vernon saw them be began bellowing boy what do you mean by leaving you have chores to do you need to do the gardening mow the lawn mop the kitchen vacuum and wash the car i sorry uncle vernon it was ginny first day here and i harry was interrupted by ginny who was red with anger how dare you treat him like a slave you have no right where is your whale of a son does he ever do any work you are pathetic you make me sick where is your shame ginny volume had matched and then surpassed uncle vernon uncle vernon was temporarily shocked by such a loud outburst from the diminutive red head you freak you will not harry stepped forward and shielded ginny he would allow uncle vernon to yell at him but not ginny not his ginny you will not speak to her in that tone harry voice was different the tenor of power permeated it uncle vernon hesitated and then opened his mouth harry could tell that by the color in his face which was changing from red to puce that he was going to start yelling again or worse harry put his hand on his wand aunt petunia voice caused the attention in the room to shift vernon just leave them alone it better if they are not in the house anyway harry was shocked he felt ginny grasp his hand and pull him toward the stairs they could hear aunt petunia talking to uncle vernon harry was even more surprised when aunt petunia took dinner up to his room for him and ginny and told him that it would be best if they didntcome down that night the next day they worked out a schedule with his relatives where harry did one chore a day the rest of the day harry could spend with ginny that day harry did the gardening ginny helped him and he found that he actually enjoyed working with her they were finishing the gardening when they were interrupted by two owls one was from hogwarts and carried two letters the other owl was obviously from the weasleys as it was carried by errol their family owl ginny ripped open the letter from her mother first oh harry i dontbelieve it dad won the lottery look here a clipping she showed him a clipping from the daily prophet that was an old photo of the entire family including scabbers on ron shoulder harry laughed he was glad the weasleys deserved the money they re going to egypt ginny sounded more shocked by this announcement bill is going to show them around the tombs there they are going without me how do you like that she had mixed feelings about being left behind but she was still smiling what does hogwarts want harry handed ginny her letter and opened his oops i forgot to choose my classes for next year what do you think ron chose care of magical creatures and divination and hermione is taking everything i think harry they are advancing me i going to be in your year he hugged her in congratulations smiling harry changed his question so what classes are we taking looking down the list ginny checked off two i like care of magical creatures and it will give us a class with ron but divination sounds hokey to me bill told me that ancient runes is interesting and is good for a lot of careers plus i like the idea of being able to read them when others can t harry nodded sounds good to me he didnteven think about what ron would think when he found out that he wasntin the same classes like they had planned ginny mischievously smiled at him so you think you can catch me harry nodded and without another word ginny ran off at full speed harry launched himself after her a moment later what the matter potter cantyou catch me just give me time you re fast harry sent back as he continued to run after her his longer legs were slowly gaining on her it wasntuntil they reached the park that he caught up to her and tackled her to the ground the rolled down a small hill and when they stopped harry found himself on top of ginny who was smiling and laughing her hair was fanned out behind her like a red halo and her faced was flushed from running after they finished laughing ginny looked into his eyes harry had the sudden feeling he was supposed to do something but he didntknow what not knowing what to do he let his eyes go over her face from her brows eyes nose lips chin and then back to her eyes then he said my ginny ginny smiled at him and hugged him whispering in his ear my harry just as he was about to pull back ginny softly kissed his cheek his senses wheeled and he felt a feeling that he could only describe as only extreme pleasure he d never felt this good the closest was when ginny held him close harry deciding that since she had kissed him he probably should kiss her back he turned his head and kissed her cheek harry wasntalone in his experience when her lips touched harry cheek she felt a tingling sensation travel from her lips down her spine all the way to her toes then harry kissed her cheek and she thought she just might explode with pleasure oh harry what going on i i think this must be part of the bonding so does this make me your girlfriend her voice sounded tentative and uncertain harry tensed and searched his feelings no ginny i dontthink this makes you my girlfriend the wave of sadness and disappointment from ginny almost made him cry before he could continue i think this makes you much much more i not sure what but i am yours your harry just as you are my ginny my harry i am your ginny harry if kissing cheeks does that what will kissing be like i dontknow i thought i was going to explode when you kissed me that exactly how i felt harry rolled to his side ginny unwilling to release him from her hug was dragged on to her side as well snaking his arms around her harry placed his mouth by her ear ginny i dontknow what i d do if you left or stopped talking to me you re you are i not saying this right you re a part of me now i understand harry remember what you told me you told me i would never be alone again and you were right even when tom attacked me and and took over he couldntreally touch me because of you you were there our bond protected me now let go enough serious stuff let practice our forms i want to be able to fly by the end of the summer the days quickly became a routine of doing whatever chore his relatives assigned and then they would leave to practice the animagus transformation and play in the park three weeks later they had made progress on their forms they could both hold their arms as wings harry could even get his body to start turning into feathers while ginny had managed a beak they were getting closer and closer to a full transformation they had tried their panther forms but focused on the phoenix form since they both loved to fly if hermione had been there she would have told them it was impossible to manage it that quickly weeks passed and soon it was harry birthday ginny tickled him awake wake up harry she was sitting on him in nothing but her knickers and one of his shirts she slept in both of them had given up wearing a full set of pajamas with the nights being so warm after spending so much time with ginny he was now a match for tickling her and quickly responded in kind soon he had ginny pinned i give up i give up you win harry gave her a doubtful look did you just admit you lost at something she stuck her tongue out at him it your birthday happy birthday harry she hugged him some owls came in the night there something here from ron hermione and hagrid i see four presents there ginny blushed one from me too harry smiled and he sat down cross legged in front of the small pile he picked up the one from ginny first and unwrapped it ginny sat down beside him their knees touching the wrapping came off it revealing a photo album ginny thank you when we looked through yours all you had was old photographs i thought you could fill this one with new photos harry opened the album and discovered there were already a few pictures there was one picture with the whole weasley family harry noticed it was the same one that was in the newspaper one of just the kids including a tiny ginny another of just ron and finally one of only ginny which was blushing but smiling and waving at him grinning as far as his face would allow he thanked ginny again ron present was a sneakoscope that he bought in egypt hermione had sent a broomstick service kit when he opened hagrid gift he was surprised to find a book the monster book of monsters harry and ginny were quickly standing on top of his bed as the book came alive and tried to bite them harry jumped down on top of the book flattening it ginny grabbed a belt and they tied the book together here a note from mom and dad ginny said handing it over to him they say i now have my own hand on the clock harry said that great harry now let get dressed and get out of here before those horrible muggles give you chores on your birthday after they grabbed some toast for a quick breakfast they were out the door before the dursleys had even stirred you know we might be able to leave here soon and be at the burrow before your birthday dumbledore said that we might be able to leave by my birthday i dontthink so harry i think they ll be in egypt until about my birthday they spent most of the day with their animagus transformation it was the first day that they had actually achieved complete transformations but they were unable to hold them for very long according to their research they just had to keep practicing until they trained their bodies to hold that form for both of them training had ceased to be work and had turned into fun although they had only managed to hold the forms for a few minutes they had discovered that with new forms came whole new ways to play and discover the world around them during their time in the park they were surprised when an owl arrived with a birthday cake from mrs weasley they had no idea how she had managed to send one when she was in egypt but they were happy for it nonetheless it allowed them to put off having to return to number 4 for food when they walked in shortly before suppertime uncle vernon and aunt petunia were watching the news the beeps from the television announced a special report look at that said uncle vernon in his gruff voice they say this sirius black escaped from prison and is armed and dangerous hey they didntsay where he escaped from he could be near here and we d not know harry felt ginny astonishment when she heard the name sirius black and she had grabbed his hand and moved closer to him how do you know the name he a wizard he was sent to azkaban a long time ago just after v v voldemort disappeared is it normal for wizard escapees to appear on the muggle news you dont understand harry no one has ever escaped from azkaban dad says the prison is guarded by dementors and those things drain a wizard of his powers the next day harry took ginny to see mrs figg like he promised to do on the train harry knocked on the door when mrs figg opened it she looked shocked to see harry why harry it good to see you do they need me to watch you and who is this lovely girl harry smiled at mrs figg no ma am this is ginny she wanted to meet you ginny shook mrs figgs hand and as they were still standing in the doorway one of her cats snowy harry thought snuck out harry that not a cat it a kneazle what a kneazle a magical creature they look like cats and can even breed with them but only witches and wizards are supposed to have them harry looked at mrs figg again and she seemed to notice their attention on her cat and was looking increasingly uncomfortable then harry did something he had never done before he asked about her cats mrs figg what type of cat is snowy mrs figg paled and ginny spoke it a kneazle not a cat and you know it come in come in we cantdiscuss this outside mrs figg ushered them inside and served them tea let get this out of the way i not a witch i a squib i ve watched over you harry for a long time if you get into trouble i supposed to inform dumbledore harry felt like his world had just turned upside down mrs figg the batty neighbor with too many cats knew about the magical world knew what and who he was knew dumbledore and had known it all why didntyou ever tell me what a squib someone born to a magical family but who cantperform magic well you see dear the dursleys would never have let you stay with me if i told you about magic or if you enjoyed yourself mrs figg let the comment hang for a moment you dontknow how often i ve wanted to tell you everything you re such a nice boy and those dursleys are are they are just evil to treat you like they do harry was still in shock but ginny wasn t ginny was angry you mean dumbledore knew how they treated him mrs figg nodded sadly ginny was still fuming when they left mrs figg and harry had been trying for an hour to calm her down harry couldntfigure out how to ease her anger finally he just hugged her tightly she hugged back but he could feel the rage radiating from her harry was touched that she cared so much for him he was sure that if she saw dumbledore right now she would either yell at him or hex him or maybe both knowing ginny he looked down at her face and decided he kissed her on the lips the kiss was very quick but ginny emotions changed from anger to astonishment to pure happiness in a moment harry understood when he kissed her he had momentarily thought the world had exploded it felt like every nerve ending in his body was tingling in pleasure ginny had melted into his arms and her entire weight was now on him although neither noticed it a pulse of magic emanated from them similar to the one when they first met though not as powerful dontbe angry my ginny his use of the possessive probably calmed her as much as the kiss did and she tried to explain herself it makes me so angry to think that dumbledore knew and he didntdo anything you re my harry you shouldnthave had to live like this the day before ginny birthday they still hadntheard anything about leaving privet drive but they had made significant progress on their forms for the past two days they had been able to hold their forms for the entire time they were in the park today they were flying high above privet drive learning flying and controlling their phoenix bodies seemed to come by instinct and they ran into no difficulties they were now figuring out the tricks to flying and gliding they had yet to figure out how to flame travel but they had discovered that they could indeed sing like a normal phoenix and lift immensely heavy loads they had actually carried each other along with lifting some large cement blocks they had found on the edge of the park harry glanced down at the sleeping ginny and wondered when he should wake her it was her birthday but she liked to sleep in so he thought he d let her the only problem was that the position she preferred meant using him as a pillow if he tried to move she only held onto him tighter his present for ginny had arrived and he had ungracefully untied the package from the owl with one hand he thought it was strange that she hadntreceived any owls from her parents another owl flew through the window and hooted loudly ginny stirred as harry detached the letters from it and the owl flew off again how long did you plan to allow me to sleep as long as you wanted happy birthday she giggled we might be here awhile i comfortable who was the owl from hogwarts letters okay ginny shifted hooking one of her legs around his and moving her head higher on his chest so she was more comfortable smelling the wild flower sent of her hair harry wondered how am i ever going to sleep without you i ve become attached to you too you re more comfy than any pillow her breathing slowed down again and harry knew she had fallen asleep again for the next two hours harry watched her sleep and played with a lock of her hair unwilling to move for fear of waking her he did not understand what was happening to them he had not understood it since the first day he had met her but he did know that he could not live without her now it was after ten o clock when ginny woke do i get presents now she asked without moving harry chuckled well you re going to have to move a letter from your parents came too ginny stretched alongside harry and sat up harry grabbed her waist and pulled himself up as ginny swatted him playfully the letter from her parents was opened first ginny smiled and showed it to harry mr weasley was going to pick them up at four the only other present that was there was harry s apparently the weasleys were waiting until ginny was home she opened it and gaped at it in surprise it was a leather bound diary harry felt the mix of emotions it evoked i thought you might like a diary you know something to put your thoughts down in and i promise the only charm that is on this one is that you are the only person who can open it harry explained she smiled at harry and opened the diary and taking a quill began scratching first the date 11 august 19xx which was followed by a short entry today is my twelfth birthday it has been the best yet i woke up next to harry yes the harry potter he gave me this diary and we are leaving to go to the burrow at four their hogwarts letters contained their booklists and permission slips to visit hogsmeade harry walked downstairs hesitantly and asked uncle vernon for his signature the paper went unsigned and harry received a lecture boy i not signed anything of yours especially after you didntmake breakfast and you ve been slacking off your chores this summer anyways maybe if you are on your best behavior when marge arrives i ll reconsider when harry told him he was leaving the same day at four uncle vernon still refused to sign the form and harry dragged himself back upstairs back at the burrow mrs weasley was giving her four boys a lecture ginny and harry are coming back today they have spent the entire time together so they will probably be closer than when you last saw them i do not want any teasing despite the warning the twins eyes lit up if i catch any of you teasing them her eyes bored into the twins you will wish you had died at birth after she left the kitchen fred and george immediately began walking up the stairs towards ginny room they planned on redecorating it percy just shrugged he had n e w t s and his head boy position to worry about besides harry and ginny were too young for anything serious to be going on ron remained sitting at the table sipping some tea and eating biscuits ginny and harry were already very close there were only a few ways for them to get closer in ron opinion but he didntsee how that was possible sure harry had said that maybe one day he and ginny might be more than friends but it could not be that day already after all he had only started to even think of girls seriously in that way at four mr weasley arrived in his car and knocked on the door harry and ginny greeted him enthusiastically eager to escape privet drive the dursleys had vacated the house and where out in the backyard to avoid his arrival once they were on the road they began telling mr weasley about how they had spent their time describing the park after they finished telling mr weasley about mrs figg and her kneazles ginny ranted about dumbledore permitting harry to be treated horribly while at the dursleys mr weasley told them to tell the others that they had been at a health spa in london when they arrived at the lopsided burrow only mrs weasley was there to greet them with her bone crushing hugs happy birthday ginny it so good to have you back home oh and it good to see you too harry we were so worried giving them a critical glance she announced oh look at how much you ve both grown it amazing how quickly you grow when you re young harry blushed a little he had noticed that ginny had grown and not just taller she informed harry he would be sharing ron room like before harry and ginny lugged their trunks back up to their respective rooms when they opened the door to ginny room they were shocked to see the room covered in pictures of harry that had been obviously copied out of a newspaper article somewhere i going to kill fred and george we can do it together i guess we dontget to sleep together any more mom probably never liked the idea to start with i just waiting for a lecture on being a scarlet woman i think it is going to be tough falling asleep tonight when they came down the stairs they were greeted by a loud surprise and happy birthday ginny from the gathered weasleys there was a large chocolate cake and a small mound of presents throughout the evening there was a lot of quidditch talk news about the ministry and discussion about the escape of sirius black harry asked more questions about black but didntlearn much more than what ginny had told him already although he noted that mr and mrs weasley looked distinctly uncomfortable when the topic was brought up ginny and harry were both surprised how little they were questioned about the month and a half they spent together other than saying they went to a health spa and spent a lot of time in a park they didnthave to explain themselves after a game of chess which harry almost won thanks to ginny help they all went up to bed harry hugged ginny and whispered to her i ll miss you she squeezed him a little harder in answer and then let go and went into her own room ron looked on quietly not willing to risk his mother wrath over a hug harry was tossing and turning when ron had fallen asleep and started snoring he simply could not fall asleep without ginny he wanted to feel her by his side to wrap his arms around her without her there it just was not right in ginny room she was doing much the same and wishing she was beside harry with a small pop ginny had disappeared from her bed and reappeared on harry cot this is interesting was all harry commented as he looked at her dumbfounded did you just apparate no i dontthink so i just wanted to be near you and well here i am now lie down i tired harry smiled and lay on his back so she could place her head on his chest they quickly realized no matter how they positioned their bodies they would not be able to sleep in their usual places they settled for harry spooning ginny and wrapping his arms around her they were asleep within ten minutes in a twisted turn of fate ron actually woke up first after having a nightmare about giant spiders he sat up groggily and wiped the sleep out of his eyes as he got up to go use the bathroom he glanced at harry cot ron eyes widened and his face quickly turned red ginny harry what do you think you re doing you shouldntbe in here ginny and harry woke up with a start and were on their feet quickly ginny had only her knickers and one of harry shirts on while harry had on even less dressed in only his boxers ron face somehow turned even redder you re not even wearing pajamas mom mom mrs weasley footfalls could be heard as she raced up the stairs to her screaming child what is it ron she said as the door opened ron motioned first to harry then to ginny then to the bed ron just tell me what wrong or breakfast is going to burn they they were sleeping together said ron exasperated he could not believe it his baby sister and his best mate were caught sleeping in the same bed by him and in his room mrs weasley turned and surveyed harry and ginny and looked like she was about to start yelling when they started trying to explain what happened although mrs weasley did not punish them she did have mr weasley put apparition and anti apparation wards on both ginny and ron rooms the day was spent de gnoming the garden and practicing quidditch as the evening approached mrs weasley announced that they would be going to diagon alley the next day and they needed to make sure they had their booklist with them harry drew back the sheets and got into bed ron was still ruffling through his trunk and his desk looking for something what are you looking for harry asked eager to get to sleep oh well i guess i dontneed it you re taking the same classes as me anyway ron backed away from his desk and moved toward his bed harry sat up and looked at ron guiltily actually ron i taking ancient runes and care of magical creatures i forgot to turn in the form during the year and dumbledore owled me with a new one why are you taking ancient runes it sounds like a lot of work ron had chosen his classes on what were least likely to assign homework i i just thought that it looked interesting and bill says that ancient runes is useful harry shifted slightly knowing he was not telling the entire truth ron looked at him funny harry how do you know what bill says ginny told me she asked him for advice on what classes to take oh wait why is ginny asking advice about classes already she only going into her second year ron seemed unusually quick tonight er the same day i got my form dumbledore also sent ginny a letter telling her that her test scores were so good that she would be advanced a year ron goggled him what that crazy i mean if they didntadvance hermione why advance ginny hermione is going to have kittens ron seemed more amused by what hermione reaction would be than the reason for ginny advancement harry was grateful and rolled over to try to sleep again no matter what position he tried he felt restless without ginny he supposed dumbledore had been wrong in his guess about the need for contact ending around his birthday in the room below ron s ginny punched the mattress in frustration she could not sleep she needed harry with her to sleep it was as simple as that the only comfort she had was that she knew harry felt the same way she sighed and wished they could repeat last night but knew she could not go to ron room again harry turned onto his back and stared at the ceiling he wished not for the first time for ginny to be beside him but knew ron would really blowup if he found her here again he closed his eyes and did not hear the pop he gave as he disappeared his nose was suddenly assaulted with the scent of wild flowers as ginny hugged him in relief harry opened his eyes in confusion ginny did you apparate again no silly you did i dontthink we are apparating though dad put up wards remember or maybe you broke through them yeah well since i here harry smiled and rolled onto his back ginny bed was large enough for them to sleep how they preferred he felt ginny smile against his chest as she adjusted herself putting an arm around him she used it to pull herself tight against his side harry sighed not in frustration this time but in contentment harry woke to a knocking at the door his face was buried in ginny long red hair her head had moved down from his shoulder to the middle of his chest and she was mostly laying on him rather than the mattress ginny dear you need to get up mrs weasley said through the closed door harry felt a moment of panic and wondered what mrs weasley would do to them but he smiled in amusement when ginny only answered five more minutes and only tried to snuggle into him closer in about five minutes mrs weasley returned knocked and then opened the door without waiting for an answer evidently she was used to having to wake ginny more forcefully than calling through the door when she stepped through into ginny room she froze staring at the intertwined bodies of harry and ginny mrs weasley closed the door and pulled the chair from ginny desk close to the bed and sat down are you both awake now yes ma am answered harry nervously ginny turned to face her mother and sat up harry followed her example mrs weasley took a moment to collect her thoughts i take it that you are still in the stage of the bonding that we discussed at hogwarts harry nodded mrs weasley frowned is the need to be close stronger or weaker than before stronger they both answered at once okay while you two have been together have you done anything and i mean anything that caused a reaction of some kind harry and ginny exchanged a look both blushing ginny answered when when we kissed mrs weasley raised her eyebrows have you kissed since then they shook their heads several emotions crossed mrs weasley face as she struggled with what she was about to say perhaps you should kiss again without saying another word she rose and left harry did my mother just say i should kiss you i think she told me to kiss you do you okay harry and ginny leaned in toward each other the pulse of magic that raced over the countryside continued for several miles before starting to dissipate albus dumbledore while sitting at his desk barely felt it and passed it off as merely an itch at the burrow mrs weasley smiled and hoped that it signaled the end in ginny room the pair gazed at each other intently i think we just completed the bonding that was amazing ginny i feel i not sure what i feel but i feel different i know harry i feel it too what are we though we arentjust friends and you are more than a girlfriend girlfriends canttalk to their boyfriends with only their mind or suddenly pass through apparition wards shhhh harry i am yours it is as simple as that and you you are mine we need to do some research on soul bonding i think there is more than they re telling us harry nodded i think we better get dressed when they appeared together at the table no one said anything except fred who wanted to know if they slept well it earned him a glare from mrs weasley harry stood before the fireplace and shuttered slightly before he took a pinch of floo powder relax harry just pronounce it correctly this time you get lost this time and i will hurt you cutting his eyes at ginny harry saw that she was serious throwing the powder into the fire he stepped into the fire and carefully called out diagon alley he tripped out of the fireplace and found himself in the leaky cauldron fred or maybe george caught him and they waited for the rest of the weasleys ron somehow managed to convince the family to visit quality quidditch supplies first harry reluctantly didntfollow and he and mr weasley went to gringotts mr weasley allowed harry to go with the goblin in the cart alone as he visited a different counter as the goblin led him to the cart he introduced himself as grisphook just as they reached the cart the goblin looked intently at harry smiling a toothy smile the goblin spoke mr potter i offer you congratulations on your successful bonding please also offer my congratulations to your bond mate harry was not sure how to react thank thank you but how do you know mr potter your bonding is evident to any who can see properly i am surprised that you have not informed gringotts of your bonding it alters your status with us it does yes sir for gringotts your bonding is considered proof of adulthood i will inform the manager after your business is completed you should expect to be contacted shortly okay thank you the goblin nodded and led the cart to harry vault harry refilled his money bag do you have any more business mr potter no thank you gripshook for all your help mr weasley had told him that it was always good to be polite to the goblins harry met mr weasley in the lobby and met the rest of the weasleys at flourish and blotts they quickly found all their books and while harry was in the back he asked an attendant if they had any books on soul bonds the attendant showed him a few books and pointed out the most authoritive one harry added it to his pile their next stop was to get new robes harry was quickly fitted by madam malkin while ron and ginny went to the used rack harry can i have your old robes we could resize them easily enough for me yeah sure they re in pretty good shape harry actually found the idea of ginny in his robe appealing he did not understand why but the feeling was there i like it too this way you will always be near ginny turned to her mom who was helping sort through the rack mom would harry old robes work for me yes dear if harry doesntmind he doesn t shouldntyou mrs weasley started and then stopped as she remembered some of the consequences of the bonding dumbledore had told them ron came over with a pile of robes and saw gnny putting hers back on the rack ginny what are you doing harry going to give me his old robes they re probably in better condition than these anyway she said matter of factly ron face reddened you shouldntaccept them ron said stubbornly he did not like the idea of accepting charity ron hush harry just going to throw them out and he is willing to let ginny have them no sense in letting them go to waste said mrs weasley harry walked over with his bag of new robes and smiled at ginny behind them ron scowled the only thing ginny had been forced to buy were bras when they walked out of the store they met back up with fred and george who had disappeared to zonkos percy was still off at some specialty shop looking for a present for his girlfriend they had just started walking when they heard a shout ron harry ginny hermione was walking toward them with two large bags from flourish and blotts her parents were behind her with several other heavy looking bags hermione what do you need all of those books for ron asked oh ron i taking more subjects than you are mom and dad said i could get a pet for my birthday i think i ll get an owl i ve got to visit the pet store too scabbers has been off since egypt ron said and paired off with hermione obviously pleased to have someone to talk to besides harry and ginny the weasleys invited hermione and her new cat crookshanks to stay with them for the rest of the holidays to which she readily agreed arriving back at the burrow george joked that now that both ron and hermione were sharing their rooms harry and ginny would have to sleep in separate beds hermione had raised an eyebrow in question but ron had thrown a glance at his mom and whispered later later arrived sooner than harry or ginny would have liked so what did george mean by saying you two had to sleep in separate beds neither harry nor ginny answered but ron did his coloring a little well the first night they were here ginny apparated into harry bed and then the next night harry did the same through the apparition wards mind you hermione turned to the couple you know how to apparate you re not supposed to until your seventeen no we dontknow how it just kinda happened we just got used to used to being around each other so much at the health spa and i was wishing i was near ginny and suddenly i was there shifting uncomfortably under hermione narrowed eyes harry fidgeted hermione eyes narrowed further in suspicion ginny felt harry discomfort and noticed hermione narrowed eyes hermione did you know dumbledore advanced me to the third year she said with a huge grin it was enough to completely distract hermione he did that wonderful what classes are you taking what were your marks on last year exams they must have been really good to skip a year do you want to study with us ron and harry laughed at hermione gush of questions and ginny looked like a deer caught in headlights you better not be laughing at me thanks for distracting her but it is funny only hermione would be this excited yeah i got the letter a little bit after term ended i taking ancient runes and care of magical creatures with harry hmmm what else did you ask my scores were near perfect or better according to the letter and of course i want to study with you hermione looked back to harry i thought you were taking divination not ancient runes but i think it a much better choice she finished casting a sidelong look to ron ron frowned at least you will be in divination with me ron had evidently forgiving her for allowing her cat to attack scabbers in the pet shop yes but it doesnt sound near as respectable as courses like arithmacy or ancient runes yet it does sound interesting over the next couple of weeks they played a lot of quidditch and chess and even occasionally studied at hermione insistence it wasntuntil the morning before they left for kings cross that harry and ginny managed to sneak away and practice flying as phoenixes they still had not told anyone about their ability to transform when they came in for lunch looking very windswept harry found two letters from gringotts waiting one was addressed to harry the other to ginny harry wondered what it could be about gringotts had never written to him before it must be about the soul bonding remember the goblin said they would contact you harry opened the letter dear mr harry j potter on behalf of gringotts and the goblin council congratulations on your successful soul bonding with one ginevra m weasley please inform us if you or your bond mate desire to be addressed differently soul bonding is recognized by gringotts as proof of maturity you are now considered an adult by this institution as an adult and last potter heir gringotts hereby grants you sole access to the potter family vault please visit gringotts soon and inspect the vault to ensure that it has been kept in trust by gringotts satisfactorily further the potter investments that have been managed in trust since the death of the last adult potter are now legally yours as well please consult your account manager at your earliest convenience to discuss these investments in addition to liquid investments gringotts is currently in possession of the deeds to several pieces of property owned by the potter family if you would like to make any changes to these properties please contact your account manager congratulations again mandrake goblin high council griphook potter family account manager ginny letter was exactly the same harry why am i being told about your investments i think we need to read the book i bought no if hermione finds it she ll figure out what going on for sure we are going to have to wait until we can read it at hogwarts why are we keeping it a secret do you want to tell them no i dontlike dumbledore and the rest knowing either but we wontbe able to keep it a secret for long i know but other people can figure it out without us saying anything harry ran upstairs to put the gringotts letter safe in his trunk he came back down before ginny and found mr weasley looking furtive harry come here i ve got something to tell you the ministry doesntwant me to tell you but i think you should know sirius black the man that escaped from azkaban was a very strong supporter of you know who we think he broke out to kill you harry felt ginny gasp in his mind why he insane he thinks that if he kills you it will bring you know who back everyone was surprised to find that mr weasley had arranged for two ministry cars to take the entire family to kings cross once they arrived the drivers of the lime green sedans tipped their hats to mr weasley and sped off harry was amazed percy had changed so quickly into robes and pinned his head boy badge to their front percy walked over to a long haired brunette harry stifled a laugh as george pointed out that they had managed to change the badge to say bighead boy the talk on the train seemed to have only one subject the escape of sirius black some people wondered why he had escaped others were more concerned about how he escaped everyone seemed to agree on one thing though the azkaban guards were scary and not to be trifled with the compartment that the four of them found was shared by only one other person this person was a man who seemed to be going prematurely grey and was sleeping hermione was the one to point out that his briefcase identified him as professor remus lupin and that he probably was the new defense professor a few minutes later they were all happy that they were sharing the compartment with the sleeping professor draco malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle made his usual visit i bet you re going to try and catch black yourself huh potter shove off malfoy was harry only response or are you scared going to stay safe in the castle malfoy cackled at him do you really want to start trouble in front of a professor asked hermione innocently as she gestured to professor lupin malfoy eyes narrowed but he did not say anything more before stalking off that was brilliant hermione commented ron this year i not going to take any bull from malfoy after the food trolley passed by and their stomachs were comfortably full ron somehow convinced hermione to join him in a game of wizard chess meanwhile harry fell asleep leaning against ginny who once harry was asleep silently guided his head down into her lap and began absentmindedly running her fingers through his hair the train gave a sudden jolt and then began to slow down harry woke to find his head in ginny lap and her arms preventing him from rolling onto the floor thanks ginny what going on hermione forehead crinkled we cantbe there yet it too early ron had moved to the window hey i think we being boarded there are people with hoods outside the lights in the train went out and the temperature noticeably dropped harry and ginny moved closer together instinctively the click of the compartment door signaled someone arrival whose here we are answered ron who that neville take a seat neville said hermione then hey what was quiet an authoritive voice broke through the babble then a soft light filled the compartment and professor lupin stood with what looked like a small ball of blue flame in his palm now stay here while i go and check with the conductor to see what the problem is however professor lupin never made it out of the compartment just as he reached the compartment door the door slid open standing in the doorway was a black robed and hooded creature it seemed to draw a low rattling breath that removed all warmth from the area harry felt the world around him start to go black he was hearing voices hearing himself say please ginny dontbe dead and then tom riddle voice answering him then he heard a woman scream and please not harry harry passed out beside him ginny was faring no better and reliving her experience in the chamber and several other dark memories she was slowly succumbing to the darkness around her vision but before this happened professor llupin muttered a spell under his breath and a shimmering silver wall appeared in front of the black robed creature and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our robes the black robed creature left harry woke to find himself cradled in the arms of a very pale ginny her brown freckles seemed to standout livid against her white skin who screamed what was that thing professor lupin had returned and was breaking off pieces of a large bar of chocolate that harry was one of the azkaban guards a dementor they were searching the train for sirius black here eat some of this chocolate it will make you feel better harry looked around the room everyone looked pale although ginny looked easily the worse sitting up he opened his arms to her which she quickly collapsed into it was awful harry i felt like i wouldntever be happy again or warm did you hear things yeah mostly to do with the chamber before you got there you i remembered the chamber too and i think my mother right before oh harry i sorry shhh just let me hold you you should eat that chocolate i haventpoisoned it lupin put a piece in his own mouth as if to demonstrate everyone soon followed suit and to their surprise found warmth returning to them when they arrived at hogwarts mcgonagall asked harry ginny and hermione to follow her harry and ginny looked at each other guiltily wondering what they had done mcgonagall saw the look and huffed slightly you are not in trouble although i have no doubt that by tomorrow you will have done something mcgonagall was the professor most adept at catching harry and ginny when they were pranking entering her office they were met by madam pomfrey who began fussing over them immediately i cantbelieve it dementors how awful foul loathsome creatures you should all have some chocolate when they informed her professor lupin had already given them chocolate she noted appreciatively that is was about time they had a defense professor who knew proper defense after madam pomfrey filed out mcgonagall began thank you mr potter and ms weasley you may return to the great hall i need to speak to miss granger about her schedule ginny and harry filed out that was strange what she called me ms weasley she always used to call me miss weasley she also called hermione a miss not a ms it reminds me of the gringotts letter asking about how we wished to be address do you think mcgonagall knows about the bonding dumbledore probably told her i want to know what going on i want to look at the book tonight okay where meet me at the astronomy tower i ll transform and fly there they waited ten minutes before hermione came out of mcgonagall office smiling like the cheshire cat what did mcgonagall want ginny asked hermione would only shake her head and was saved further interrogation when they joined the rest of the school at the feast ginny and harry waited impatiently for their roommates to fall asleep harry knew ginny had left ten minutes ago but he could not transform until he heard ron snores finally ron snores began to roll through the dormitory and harry transformed he grabbed the book in his talons and flew out the window harry eyes alighted on a red phoenix soaring high above the astronomy tower flapping his wings he flew higher to join ginny after a few minutes of gentle play in the air they flew down to the tower neither saw another phoenix observing them from the window of the headmaster office it did not take them long of searching the book to find out that soul bonding changed both of their situations dramatically many of the rights that were reserved for adult wizards and witches were automatically conferred as soul bonding was considered proof of maturity although it did not remove the constraints of laws placed on those defined as underage it did grant most legal adult rights that related to financial and guardianship matters most significantly was that soul bonding was considered proof of marriage ginny watched harry carefully she had felt his shock at the idea of being married she reached out and took his hand harry are you all right she was beginning to worry that harry did not want to be married to her harry picked up the thought and squeezed her hand i okay i guess i mean this doesntreally change anything i m i yours and you re mine i just didntthink it was so i dontknow formal harry stared at ginny he was not disappointed to be married to her it was just that he was not even fourteen it all seemed so fast reflecting over all that had happened since he had met her harry realized that he would not want it any other way well at least this explains why your mom allowed you to stay with me in the same bed too harry smiled at ginny and she hugged him in relief you realize that i should now be called mrs potter not weasley or ms anything ginny said with mischief in her eyes trying to shock harry now that he had accepted the idea he only smiled and then brought her into a tighter hug while kissing her on the cheek harry crawled stealthily back into his bed and slept under the covers goodnight wife ginny smile and quiet laugh of delight could be felt through the bond goodnight husband harry did not understand how calling each other husband and wife gave him such a warm feeling he could only revel in the feeling he closed his eyes and went to sleep happy the next few weeks were uneventful after the third years got used to ginny with them it had come as quite a shock when they had learned that she had skipped a year the professors were pleased with both harry and ginny work except professor snape who seemed to find the presence of two weasleys in his class insulting and was trying to achieve a new level of vindictiveness they found that snape treated them with equal hostility and decided it was best to work together during potions since snape had a tendency to mark them and their partners lower even for his normal low standards for gryffindors hermione was working herself crazy with more than a full load of classes and trying to keep ahead of harry and ginny in the classes they shared defense against the dark arts was by far the most interesting aside from hagrid first class and buckbeak attack on malfoy professor lupin turned out to be an excellent professor it was the first time harry had really learned something in defense the only hiccup was when he demonstrated boggarts while he had allowed the entire class to face it he had not allowed harry and ginny they had both noticed him giving the two of them furtive glances or just looking at them strangely when he was sick they got one of the greatest shocks of their lives when they walked in and found professor snape waiting to teach the class despite what hermione tried to tell him he insisted on lecturing about werewolves ron had received detention after he had defended hermione when snape called her a know it all wood had taken quidditch practice to a level that harry had not believed possible when it came for the game against hufflepuff in october the weather was simply awful rain was pelting down and lighting crisscrossed the sky harry was immensely thankful for the charm hermione had placed on his glasses if only he had thought of also placing a warming charm on himself he thought he saw a large black dog watching him but when he turned to look again it was gone he was just beginning to think that he was frozen to his broom when he saw the snitch placing himself flat against his nimbus 2000 he soared after the snitch the air was filled with a woman scream and the pleading voice that tore into his heart please no not harry then a high cruel laugh followed by the voice he recognized as tom riddle she wontwake harry looked down and below him were at least a hundred dementors it was the last thing he saw before he lost consciousness the scent of wild flowers and comforting warmth woke harry he was in the hospital wing and ginny was hugging him tightly with the top of her head just under his nose his arms seemed to wrap around her of their own accord get off my patient right now miss weasley madam pomfrey had appeared here child eat this she ordered handing harry the largest slab of chocolate he had ever seen she did not move until he had finished the entire slab when he was finished she allowed hermione ron and the rest of the quidditch team minus wood into the ward harry was heartbroken to learn that not only had hufflepuff caught the snitch and won the game but also his trusty broom had been destroyed by the womping willow harry week only got worse when he realized that he could not go to hogsmeade he knew mcgonagall would never allow him to go with sirius black supposedly after him the only thing that cheered him up was that ginny said she would stay and they would go flying once everyone had left for hogwarts the two of them went onto the grounds and transformed out of sight they were playing a game of tag over the forbidden forest when a burst of flame announced the arrival of another phoenix fawkes was now flying around them trilling his song to their shock they understood him greetings young hatchlings it has been many a year since i have seen hatchlings ginny trilled a hello and harry joined her song hello fawkes it is good to feel the air all around you but it is nothing compared to fire young ones fawkes sang back come follow me you have much to learn for the next two hours fawkes led them on a complicated game of follow the leader he taught them many aspects of flying that they would have taken ages to learn on their own at the end he began singing a complicated trill that could not be translated into english he was instructing them on how to travel by fire when he finished he burst into flames and appeared ten feet behind them ginny and harry followed suit fawkes had been right as good as he felt to fly to feel the air through your feathers it was nothing to traveling by fire they flew and flamed for a few more minutes before fawkes concluded their lesson saying they would fly together again soon as harry and ginny flew back to the castle harry spied an individual making his way into the castle he recognized the person as professor lupin ginny i want to talk to lupin about how to fight the dementors i canthave what happened during the game happen again i want to learn too they quickly landed and making sure they were out of sight transformed and walked quickly after lupin they only caught up to him at his office where he greeted them warmly and invited them in for tea professor harry began i was wondering lupin handed him and ginny tea and sat down you were wondering why i didntallow you or ginny to take on the boggart he interrupted they both nodded i should have thought that obvious i was afraid that it would turn into lord voldemort both harry and ginny gaped at him open mouth neither had expected him to say that much less actually say voldemort name i did think it might at first but then i thought of the dementors harry admitted me too chorused ginny lupin smiled at them i surprised and impressed it says a lot that a dementor is your greatest fear it means that what you fear the most is fear very wise do you think you could teach us to fight off dementors like you did on the train asked ginny i dontknow said lupin doubtfully it very advanced magic and many full grown wizards cantmanage it it also much harder to do when there is more than one dementor please professor i cantlet what happened at the match happen again even if i cant drive them off at least i might be able to get back on the ground pleaded harry lupin sighed okay but it will have to wait until after the holidays i behind after being sick they thanked him and left to go to supper where they would meet up with ron and hermione over the next month classes went by uneventfully they quickly found that when they would sneak out to fly and practice flaming fawkes would join them giving them hints and encouragement fawkes seemed to be proud of what they had achieved he know had them carrying different weights and objects as they flamed to different locations he told them that they could only flame to a place they or their companion dumbledore to him had been before it soon became a game about who quickly one of them could flame to a location and be followed by the other when halloween rolled around the usual festivities were interrupted by sirius black attack on the fat lady after she refused to let him in she was replaced with a crazy knight that had quickly gotten onto harry nerves and insisted on changing passwords at least daily dumbledore surveyed the grounds from his window it was the end of november and the only news he had of sirius black was that he had been sighted in a small village not far from hogsmeade after the break in on halloween dumbledore was very worried about blacks ability to stay undetected he sighed he would have to be extra careful since it was a hogsmeade weekend again but at least the dementors had not crossed into hogwarts again after the quidditch match he hoped the foul creatures would stay away then there was harry he knew he was going to have to tell harry about sirius black role in his parents deaths before someone else did it was already apparent that young mr malfoy knew and was needling harry it would be better if harry found out from a friendly source rather than one that was not looking over toward his desk he saw fawkes preening himself there was something going on there too fawkes had been acting differently almost prideful and had been disappearing for long periods of time dumbledore knew it could not be bad but it was another mystery although harry and ginny were had fun last hogsmeade weekend they both still wanted to go harry convinced ginny to go without him and she had joined hermione and ron harry watched depressed as they left ginny was between the two of them since they were arguing about crookshanks trying to eat scabbers every chance he got just as he turned to go an arm draped over his shoulder another arm from his other side soon followed fred and george led him out of earshot from anyone who was nearby harry my boy we couldnthelp notice that you cantgo to hogsmeade fred said the grin on his face never faltered yes we have something that might help you with your predicament said george pulling out an old and battered piece of parchment an old parchment asked harry the twins looked scandalized and shook their heads with a sad expression can you believe that george an old parchment this harry is the secret to our success so it will be a pinch giving it to you but your need is greater than ours when we were back in our first year harry looked at them incredulously and listened to their story of stealing the map from filch and shook his head it was classic fred and george fred smile broadened now harry this is a map simply tap it with your wand like so and say i solemnly swear that i am up to no good to harry shock lines began to appear on the parchment along with moving dots that were labeled as people to clear it you tap it with your wand and say mischief managed we are sure you can find a good use for this and say take a look at this it looks like this tunnel leads out to honeydukes hmmm imagine that and filch doesntknow about it well harry tah tah harry did not even get a chance to thank them before the twins were gone so harry are you coming ginny had been listening yeah i going to grab my invisibility cloak and meet you there excellent hogsmeade was better than had been described the three broomsticks was fantastic and its butterbeer was even better zonko joke shop was full of interesting and sometimes potentially dangerous objects honeydukes the location of the secret tunnel was full of teeth rotting sweets and chocolates that ginny looked at longingly and that harry made a mental note to buy her for christmas ron and hermione were no where in sight they were probably still fighting about crookshanks and scabbers harry mused december had come and gone very quickly and it was the first day of the holidays harry had wanted to go to the burrow but mr weasley had reminded him that he was safest at hogwarts so while everybody else was packing up to go harry was scrounging in his trunk for some parchment he saw a folded piece at the bottom he picked it up and found that it was not a spare piece of parchment at all but the letter he had received from gringotts harry looked at and wondered if dumbledore would allow him to go to gringotts again like last year shrugging he decided to find out and made his way around the castle looking for a professor he found mcgonagall near the great hall and she led him to dumbledore office and provided the password when harry sat down dumbledore turned his on him and asked why he wanted to see him professor i got a letter from gringotts at the start of term about visiting my family vault and meeting my account manager and i was wondering if i could go over the break sometime harry gringotts sent you a letter saying you have access to your family vault dumbledore seemed more interested in that harry received a letter from gringotts than allowing harry to go err yes when i went there over the summer the goblin said he could see that i was soul bonded and that gringotts would be in touch oh i see said dumbledore harry i do not think it very wise for you to leave hogwarts without protection with sirius black on the loose there are some things that you need to know about black dumbledore related the story to harry about how sirius black was his parents secret keeper harry was stunned and was thankful he shared the bond with ginny who was now sending as much comfort as she could through the bond it okay harry stay calm but how why he was their friend i dontknow harry gradually controlled his warring emotions and looked back at dumbledore who appeared to have pity in his eyes he was about to stand and leave when he realized he had come to dumbledore office for a reason he wanted to go to gringotts i understand sir but could i go if mr or mrs weasley went with me or met me there i suppose that would be fine dumbledore said hesitantly ginny can you find out if they will hold on he could hear her questioning her parents they say they can take me tomorrow that i should meet them at the leaky cauldron at noon may i use your floo harry asked and dumbledore nodded his assent and did not question harry how he knew this apparently assuming he was indeed using his connection to ginny the rest of the day harry wondered around the empty halls of hogwarts aimlessly he could not believe it sirius black was the reasons he did not have a family harry tried to clear his head by shacking it for probably the thousandth time ginny had been reassuring him as much as possible all day but harry was too numb with shock to receive too much comfort he walked slowly back to the dormitory and stripped down to his boxers just as harry drew back his bed curtains a burst of flame appeared in the air above his bed and a red phoenix with brown spots ginny what are you doing here harry exclaimed momentarily shocked out of his stupor the phoenix transformed into ginny who was wearing one of the shirts she had nicked from harry over the summer she smiled at him sadly you ve been alone for too long today and you werent listening to me besides i sleep better when you re near harry started to protest but stopped before he even got the first word out he was glad she had come she opened her arms and without hesitation harry embraced her come on harry it time for bed she whispered into his ear as they settled into the bed spooning each other ginny sighed when harry put his arms around her and said i ve missed this harry did not answer except to tighten his grip on her harry fell asleep within ten minutes ginny however lay awake for some time gently fingering and caressing harry hand smiling she closed her eyes and snuggled closer to harry a n well here the next update i think the next chapter will go up to or through the ball after that i will either do a chapter each for the 2nd and 3rd task or combine them much of these chapters i using to setup what will happen in the summer i also am planning on having ron and hermione especially hermione playing a more substantial role from now on ootp will be similar to the book but will have major departures i have not yet decided what will happen to sirius yet nor am i sure about the department of mysteries but rest assured just because voldemort does not have the same access to harry mind does not mean he wants the prophecy any less book 6 will significantly depart from canon although i do plan on using the facts that jkr provided in it i would like to update in a week but it will probably be more like a week and a half to two weeks i still getting used to my new schedule getting up at 5 or so is rough and my job requires me to spend a large amount of time looking at a computer screen as it is i have no intention of not finishing the story i also do not have a beta i will get one if i decide to post this on another sight i want to finish the story before then though sorry for any errors there was something in this chapter that i wanted to change or add but for the life of me i cantremember what it was thanks to all those who reviewed i do read them and you re right they are old enough to snog disclaimer see chapter 1 dumbledore speech is word for word from gof chapter 6 the goblet of fire part ii oh harry did you receive a response from dumbledore or sirius yet ginny asked harry silently handed over the dumbledore letter to ginny her eyes moved left to right down the parchment and when she finished her hair seemed to be a darker shade of red dontlet this trouble you oh i cantbelieve that man wise my foot ginny continued muttering for awhile and harry wondered what she would do to dumbledore if she saw him right now she had not forgiven the headmaster for leaving harry with the dursleys before hogwarts and had already been furious for forcing harry to stay with the muggles over the summer harry would not want to be in dumbledore shoes when ginny really did blow up at him albus dumbledore was troubled the letter from harry had been disturbing and had confirmed some of his worse fears the link between the poor boy and voldemort was stronger and that meant voldemort was stronger then there was the matter of the old muggle death who took care of the riddle old house trouble was definitely brewing this time he was not sure that voldemort return could be forestalled he had hoped to give harry more time the boy was still so young staring out the window pensively for a few minutes dumbledore concerns only grew not only was voldemort stirring again but the tri wizard tournament would be taking place at hogwarts he hoped that he could use the tournament to bridge some of the divides between the three wizarding schools but the tournament brought danger with it and provided a high profile target at least harry would not be able to compete then there was young ginny dumbledore was not sure how she would react when harry had to go back to the dursleys next year too but it would be imperative that he do so with voldemort stirring harry safety was even more important smiling slightly dumbledore thought that the young lady had a temper to rival her mother s at the end of the year he had been a tad afraid that she might do accidental magic when she had been yelling at him dumbledore spread out a piece of parchment and started a letter with the salutation dear alastor ron gazed around his room it was a disaster not that the room was not clean for once in his life his room was actually spotless the problem was the decorations hermione face was everywhere and he actually had a hermione pillow on his bed fred and george were driving him mad at least ginny had stopped teasing him about hermione but then ginny seemed to disappear for most of the day now ron shrugged and returned to his present predicament harry would arrive tomorrow along with hermione so that they could all go to the world cup if harry saw this ron new that the embarrassment would be well it would be worse than any he had ever experienced then there was hermione if he would be embarrassed for harry to see this he would be mortified for hermione to see it mom ron screamed ron do not yell mrs weasley chastised entering his room she sighed as she surveyed it and realized why ron had yelled she started transfiguring the room back to its normal blinding orange she was going to have to talk to fred and george before harry and hermione arrived at the burrow that evening mrs weasley was not sure why the twins had transfigured everything in ron room to look like hermione since they were not too terribly perceptive about things like crushes except when they were terribly obvious she suspected that ginny had probably started it and decided that she would probably need to have a talk with her daughter too thinking of ginny made her wonder exactly where she had disappeared to indeed ginny had not been around for much of the month she would come down for a quick breakfast and then tear out of the burrow the clock mrs weasley said thinking aloud after finishing with ron room she quickly went down the stairs to the kitchen why didnti think of it before she wondered the twins them and their awful products i cantbelieve they think they could actually sell that ridiculous stuff she had caught them discussing it and flatly told them that founding a joke shop was not an option for them she cast a quick charm that caused the potatoes to start peeling themselves and looked up at the clock ginny hand was moving from traveling to home mrs weasley eyes narrowed where has she been the back door opened and mrs weasley saw a mane of red hair rush by ginevra weasley where have you been she demanded ginny froze at the sound of her mother voice and wondered how she was going to get out of this situation luckily she was saved by the entrance of fred and george they were so engrossed over a piece of paper that they did not even notice their mother presence mrs weasley however did notice them boys what do you have there she said with a menacing tone the twins paled as one noth nothing mom answered george unconvincingly give me that parchment was the response as mrs weasley extended her hand fred immediately put it behind his back terror in his eyes mrs weasley pulled her wand and said accio parchment which flew into her outstretched hand turning it over she read it and as she did her eyes got wide and she began turning red ginny retreated to her room and fred and george began to cower weasley wizarding weezes she roared the rest of the afternoon ended badly for the twins mrs weasley had searched their room and removed every order form ingredient and products she could find i hate floo powder harry thought as he exited the grate while leaving the dursleys was always great and seeing their living room in ruin was fantastic seeing dudley engorged tongue had been one of the best sights of harry life in harry opinion his overweight cousin had finally gotten what he deserved the fact that dudley had done it to himself by eating no less only made the episode more enjoyable slapping his sides and running his hands over his clothes to get the ash out harry smiled while his days had been pleasurable at the manor he was happy to be at the burrow where he did not have to worry about waking up early or having the dursleys yell about his abnormality harry barely looked up in time to see mrs weasley rush toward him with open arms the hug was bone crushing and harry was not quite sure what to make of it he was used to ginny hugging him but this was different he awkwardly tried to hug her back and settled for placing his hands on her sides as his arms were pinned to his sides harry dear why dontyou grab the silverware in the kitchen and help ginny and the boys set up the tables said mrs weasley harry quickly complied the twins tried to accost him in the kitchen with questions about dudley tongue but when he heard mrs weasley shout he decided to get out quickly he figured she must have heard the twins or mr weasley had broken down and told her ginny was having an intense discussion with bill and charlie about ireland chances at the world cup but she did mentally greet harry thus it was ron and hermione who greeted him first hermione actually beat ron to harry enveloping harry in a hug reminiscent of earlier hug harry stiffened at the contact this hug felt even more awkward than mrs weasley had hermione seemed to sense his discomfort and released him her smile barely faltering ron scowled hermione had not greeted him with the same enthusiasm the dinner was a raucous affair bill and charlie who harry had never personally met were eager to talk to harry considering how close he seemed to be to their baby sister harry found both of the older weasleys intriguing and exciting bill stories about egyptian tombs were fascinating and charlie stories about dragons were exciting while bill job as a curse breaker sounded interesting to harry dragon handling did not sound like a profession he was interested in percy who had been hired by the ministry was prattling off about something to do with cauldron bottom thickness harry now seriously regretted asking him about work beside him ginny was snickering at him and ron was shaking his head at harry they had both warned him not to talk to percy about work in the past five minutes harry had managed to count that percy said cauldron thirty times thickness thirty seven times and mr crouch forty one times harry was extremely relieved when the twins distracted percy by interrupting him to tell harry about some dragon dung that had somehow found its way into percy inbox the conversation at the table then moved on to quidditch bulgaria seeker is fantastic wait till you see how krum flies harry you wont believe it ron was practically yelling in his excitement fred laughed at ron krum may be good but ireland chasers are extraordinary it will take more than krum for bulgaria to win bill and charlie quickly agreed to fred assessment and percy seemed irritated that the conversation had slipped back to quidditch instead of work at the ministry well the world cup will be nothing compared to the next event that we are planning for you know dad the top secret one percy said emphasizing the last two words the twins rolled their eyes and ron turned to hermione trying to explain some of the intricacies of quidditch bill and charlie only laughed at percy attempt to redirect the conversation but shared a knowing look of anticipation harry was confused dontworry about it harry percy has been dropping hints all summer but wont answer any questions we just ignore him now oh okay after dinner was over mrs weasley announced that everyone had to go to bed early as they would be getting up very early in order to make it on time to the world cup after much protest from ron and the twins everyone retired for the night it felt like he had just closed his eyes when a hand on harry shoulder began shaking him awake wake up dear you need to wake up if you want breakfast mrs weasley voice cut through his haze and he slowly stood up breakfast was a quick affair consisting of toast and eggs ron complained that bill and charlie got to sleep in only to be reprimanded by mrs weasleys hush her gaze then drifted to the unusually silent twins stop empty your pockets fred and george stood staring transfixed at their mother for a couple seconds and then turned out their pockets which contained their wands and some money mrs weasley eyes only narrowed in suspicion she knew her sons and they were guilty of something then again the twins were usually guilty of something she frowned and then performed the accio charm to the twins disgust and terror mrs weasley voice was still echoing in everyone ears when their arrived at the portkey location and met up with the diggorys harry hermione and ginny who had learned a great deal about muggles from harry laughed much of the day at the complete failure of witches and wizards to dress like muggles helping mr weasley put up the tents and start a fire had been a hoot harry was sure that it took them at least twice longer than it should have to put the tents up with mr weasley help but his excitement had been funny and endearing ludo bagman appearance had led to the twins betting what was probably their entire life savings on ireland winning the match but krum catching the snitch ron had spent his money on a large shamrock and a small moving model of krum while hermione had bought everyone programs ginny had bought everyone snacks for the match and harry had bought four sets of omnioculars over ron objections the match had been fantastic the only negative part had been before its start when the malfoy had shown their face they had all retreated back to the tents and were sitting around the table discussing the match or at least the weasleys and harry were hermione had only said a few words and mostly to say that it was wrong for mr crouch to force winky to save him a seat he had never taken harry was falling asleep with ginny leaning against him listening to bill charlie and percy arguing over a chaser formation harry this was fun yeah it was replied harry verbally i think i might try out for the team when there a free spot ginny mumbled not aware she was switching between modes of communication what spot chaser or maybe or maybe seeker even in her exhaustion her t one was mischievous you think you could beat me harry questioned waking up slightly of course i know you better than you know yourself that true harry answered neither of them noticed that they were being observed ron had been watching his sister and harry suspiciously since harry had arrived at the burrow tonight was only confirming his worst fears up until now the idea of ginny being harry girlfriend had not really bothered him it was not until this summer and some of the dreams he had been having about girls and one girl in particular that he realized that harry might feel that way about ginny and that was not right watching ginny try and snuggle closer to harry was painful for him but he knew he could not do anything while his father was present but he was definitely going to have to put a stop to the relationship ever since harry arrival at the burrow ron had been feeling increasingly irritated and short with harry his too close relationship with ginny seemed to be coming even more serious hermione exuberant greeting also had been festering he could not understand why all the attention was always focused on harry ron was not the only one watching hermione was also watching two of her closest friends with suspicion but of a much different kind unlike ron who was not listening hermione had heard the odd conversation she was furiously searching her memory for what would explain harry and ginny relationship the relationship to her had always been a mystery but she had put aside most of her suspicions and natural curiosity last year but this conversation had sparked them with a new fury hermione smiled she vaguely recalled something about wizards and witches being able to talk with only their minds like some kind of advanced legilemancy due to bonds frustrated that she could not remember or had not read about the specific bond that could cause this type of ability she vowed to find the book that held the information she thought that she had read that sometimes a life debt could have unexpected consequences but it still did not explain the relationship harry and ginny had been unnaturally close even before the incident in the chamber of secrets then there had been how harry had reacted or perhaps the better term would be did not react to the veelas where ron had practically tried to jump from the top box and the twins had well hermione was not sure what they were about to do but she was sure it involved a lot of explosions harry had only watched the dancing with vague interest and had laughed at the other boys reactions as far as she knew very few males had a natural resistance to veela charm it was a matter of will power she had read but harry did not even seem to be aware that there was any charm at all hermione sighed and decided to owl order several books on bonds since she already knew the hogwarts library did not have the book she had already read that section mrs weasley was frantic the daily prophet front page showed the dark mark sparkling in the sky she paced across the kitchen waiting to hear word or for her husband and her children to show up the guilt about how she had yelled at the twins was driving her mad she would not be able to stand it if that was the last time she would ever see them she almost fainted in relief when she saw arthur and the heads of her two oldest appear over the ridge she ran out to meet them it had been several days since the incident at the world cup albus dumbledore was frustrated first he had received harry disturbing letter then there had been the death of an old muggle near the riddle old manor house now the world cup and the dark mark the death eaters were deficiently more active but he was not sure if the incidents were related he sighed he was glad that his old friend had agreed to teach the defense position it was becoming so very hard to fill back at the burrow mrs weasley was bustling around placing packages on the appropriate bed she had just got back from diagon alley with everyone school supplies she sadly looked at ron dress robes she had been able to find a nice set of robes for fred and george as well as robes that were not too bad for ginny but ron were awful but at least he had them when harry and ron had got back to ron room they were shocked when they looked through their school supplies especially when mrs weasley had informed them that the purple robes were not ginny robes but ron dress robes ron paled and harry anxiously pulled out his own dress robes and let out a sigh of relief they were green but otherwise looked mostly like his normal hogwarts robes harry felt bad for ron ron he started hesitantly since he knew how sensitive ron was about money and he had noticed that ron had seemed distant since the cup you know i could buy you different robes if you want turning to face harry ron eyes flared wide and his ears had turned red i dont need your charity or pity he yelled as he stormed off and stay away from my sister came ron voice from the hallway harry just stood in shock as he listened to ron angry footsteps as he descended the stairs as the shock began to wear off it was slowly replaced by anger harry was used to ron sensitivity about money and his low grade jealousy that occasionally erupted but telling him to stay away from ginny was going too far as far as harry was concerned harry and ron barely talked for the rest of the time at the burrow ginny ignored ron completely and hermione was stuck relaying messages between them unfortunately for ron this meant that he only had hermione to talk to and she was almost constantly talking about house elf rights and how their situation in life was slavery making the rest of time at the burrow even tenser was that the weasleys seemed to be on a mission not to allow harry and ginny to be alone harry supposed it had something to do with the incident in the garden it had been shortly after ron angry and loud comments that harry and ginny were in the garden fuming about ron ginny was ranting oh he makes me so mad how dare he if i want to snog you senseless then i will if he thinks he can control what we do together then he has another thing coming harry smiled at ginny and cocked an eyebrow you want to snog me senseless he meant the comment to be teasing but he could not deny that the idea was attractive ginny locked eyes with him and leaned up and toward him when their lips met they felt the now familiar intoxicating feeling of warmth spread throughout their entire bodies they clumsily began moving their lips and slowly began exploring how to deepen a kiss neither of them noticed a faint golden glow start to radiate from each other they were completely entranced with the other the glow was faint and was not noticed by ron either when he accidentally stumbled across them his angry yells could be heard throughout the burrow what do you think you re doing get your hands off her you think just because you re harry potter that you can have anything you re wrong ron fists were clenched harry had never seen him so angry ron was advancing on harry and looked like he was going to hit him harry was not sure how to react it never even occurred to him to defend himself as ron pulled his fist back ginny however was not going to let anyone touch harry ron fist slammed toward harry but ginny had stepped in front of him and the fist hit an invisible barrier from the sound ron fist made he appeared to have broken several bones in his hand but he had barely time to yelp before ginny had raised her own hand without even thinking she said stupefy a red light shot from her hand and ron was flung across the garden landing hard up against a tree bill and charlie had taught her the curse just in case some boy ever got to feisty in their words the resulting interrogation and explanation made mrs weasley furious at ron but the other weasleys with the exception of percy and mr weasley who were too busy at work had been keeping a close watch on ginny and harry after ginny birthday the scrutiny only increased harry had been right ginny absolutely loved the firebolt all the weasleys along with harry and hermione were sitting at down to breakfast on ginny birthday when three owls flew in dropping a long package on the table it was addressed to ginny she had only unwrapped a small portion of the package when she had flung herself at harry and kissed him passionately they were well on their way to a repeat of the garden when they were interrupted by several uncomfortable coughs which were followed by many similar questions along the vain of what is it and what did he get you proudly tearing the rest of the paper off of the firebolt she showed her family and a dazed harry there was a shocked silence and strangely enough it was hermione who acted first that great the firebolt is an excellent broom hermione still did not comprehend how expensive a firebolt was but knew enough from last year to know that it cost a lot and began wondering how harry could afford it ron looked at hermione in shock and then turned back to the broom with a look of disgust on his face instead of blowing up like usual he stalked off making a horrible racket all the way up to his room the rest of the family after they overcame their shock congratulated ginny on the fine broom while the remanding part of ginny birthday was a pleasant affair the weasleys especially the weasley boys seemed to be incredibly worried about why harry had bought their little sister a very expensive present by the time september 1st rolled around everyone harry and ginny were very glad to be returning to the relatively unchaperoned environment of hogwarts hermione was also visibly pleased the tension at the burrow had probably been even worse for her than the other two since she still felt compelled to talk to ron she was also excited about returning to hogwarts so she could send off her owl order she had been afraid to do so while at the burrow as she was sure that percy would not allow her to use hermes errol would probably not have survived the journey and using hedwig would have been suspicious harry had completely forgotten about the letter he had sent to sirius when an owl arrived for him just as everyone was filing out the door he quickly untied the letter and pocketed the letter planning on reading it on the train it was good thing that charlie and bill had accompanied them to kings cross as between the four of them they had a lot of luggage charlie smiled at them and said well that all of it it was nice to see all of you it has been too long but who knows we might be seeing each other soon again bill laughed at the chorus of questions and added yeah with what is happening at hogwarts i might even have to find my way there i would love to see it ron and ginny tried to get their older brothers to tell them more even screaming out questions from the windows as the train left the platform but it was futile once the platform was out of sight ron left the group with a sneer at harry harry only shook his head utterly disgusted with ron ginny and hermione had similar looks on their faces from the hallway they heard a familiar drawl well if it not the weasel so where potter the mudblood and potter toy that you call a sister harry felt the blood rush to his face as anger enveloped him out in the hallway ron felt a similar rush of feelings as he drew his wand and charged at malfoy who calmly said petrificus totalus ron fell to the floor frozen only his eyes free to move harry cut his eyes toward ginny and hermione both nodded imperceptibly agreeing to confront malfoy they all stepped out of the compartment wands drawn malfoy looked at them and the malice in his eyes was unmistakable well well well it looks like you three have come out to play he raked his eyes over ginny and then sneered at harry so potter when you re done with her make sure you send her malfoy never finished his thought ginny had cast her feared bat bogey hex malfoy was now on the floor screaming and clawing at his face trying to remove the disgusting creatures goyle and crabbe just looked on stupidly before picking up their falling leader and retreating harry performed the countercurse on ron picking himself off the floor ron hung his head in shame i sorry i was wrong harry patted him on the back and mumbled that it was alright i dontknow why you re so quick to forgive i think the prat needs to be taught a lesson easy ginny i think he just had one come on harry you dontactually think he actually accepted us or gotten over his jealousy do you i willing to give him the benefit of the doubt harry and ron being back on speaking terms was picked up immediately by hermione oh it so great i hate it when you dontspeak to each other said hermione with tears in her eyes as she hugged harry quickly and then pulled ron into a hug worthy of mrs weasley ron grinned bewilderedly and then returned the hug ginny looked at harry and rolled her eyes do you think they realize that they like each other yet harry only shrugged his shoulders and enjoyed the rest of the ride to hogwarts although the remainder of the train ride was uneventful as long as you did not count ron stuffing himself with sweets from the trolley as an event the hogwarts express arrived at hogsmeade in a downpour i would hate to have to cross the lake in this said hermione absently gazing at the small boats waiting for the first years everyone nodded in agreement with her many of the small boats were already half full of water the four of them wasted no time and quickly climbed into one of the carriages although they were only out in the weather for a few seconds they were drenched by the time they were all in the carriage ron led the way out of the carriage toward the great hall blimey if that keeps up the lake going to overflow i soak arrgh a large red water balloon exploded on ron head everyone looked up and above them floating with several brightly colored water balloons was peeves peeves had a malicious smile on his face which quickly changed into a mask of concentration as he took aim at a group of second years peeves yelled a very angry professor mcgonagall rushing out of the great hall she was glaring up at peeves ignorant of the water on the floor so she suddenly found herself sliding and slipping she grabbed out for the nearest object to steady her hermione sorry miss granger mcgonagall apologized peeves get down here now or i going to inform the headmaster peeves glared back at her and looked to be considering his options finally he stuck out his tongue and blew a loud raspberry and then zoomed out dropping all his balloons on the entering group of third years mcgonagall sighed and ushered everyone into the great hall they sat down at the gryffindor table and eagerly awaited the sorting so that they could eat ron was making impatient and hungry noises and hermione kept hitting him as she was having a conversation with nearly headless nick harry was only marginally paying attention to hermione conversation when he was interrupted by an eager colin creevey hiya harry guess what my brother is here this year his name is dennis i ve told him all about you he cantwait to meet you i just hope he in gryffindor brothers and sisters go in the same houses right ginny broke into colin gush of excited words not all the time just look at pavarti and padma their twins but they are in separate houses colin face fell but he quickly recovered himself oh well cross your fingers harry ginny cocked an amused eyebrow at harry who rolled his eyes i think he likes you harry he did not even pay me any attention she said silkily shut up besides i dontwant him to pay any attention to you replied harry with a smile ginny smirked at him and then gave him a nudge and nodded in dumbledore direction harry could not help noticing that ginny was looking upon dumbledore with a distinctly unfriendly gaze she was obviously still not pleased with the old man dumbledore stood and said two words tuck in the feast had begun the meal was quickly interrupted however by hermione loud yell of house elves there are house elves at hogwarts ron looked at hermione like she was crazy while harry and ginny only looked on in confusion as hermione railed about slave labor ginny leaned into harry side so that hermione could not see her as she snickered harry was left with trying to control his emotions so his face would not reveal his amusement when everyone was feeling comfortably full or in ron case uncomfortably full dumbledore stood again and began making his customary announcements hermione was sitting straight up but unlike usual she did not wear a face of rapt attention but one of announce obviously still made about house elf treatment dumbledore next statement though caused everyone to complete attention to him it is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter house quidditch cup will not take place this year fred and george mouths dropped open and harry fell back against ginny for support dumbledore let the commotion die down and then continued this is due to an event that will be starting in october and continuing throughout the school year taking up much of the teachers time and energy but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely i have great pleasure in announcing that this year hogwarts dumbledore was interrupted by the opening of the doors leading out of the great hall in the doorway stood a man in a large black coat he was very wet and did not pay any heed to the strange looks he was getting from the students he just walked up to the high table making a clank with each step harry could barely see a wooden claw poking out from underneath his cloak harry looked around in confusion george leaned across the table and whispered mad eye dumbledore smiled at the newcomer ah welcome may i introduce the new defense against the dark arts professor professor moody only stunned silence greeted dumbledore announcement it was not until the other professors began to clap did the students follow suit albeit subdued the clapping stopped completely when professor moody lowered his hood revealing his gnarled face ignoring the students reaction dumbledore continued with what he was saying as i was saying we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months an event that has not been held for over a century it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this year dumbledore went on to explain about the triwizard tournament and the rules that would govern it this year harry could not help but entertain the vision of him being introduced like krum at the world cup harry we are going to talk something in ginny voice told him that it was going to be a serious conversation ron was eagerly telling anyone who would listen to him that he would like to enter if he was seventeen and made fred and george promise to let him in on anything they did almost everyone walked to the house towers with images of winning the tournament running through their head disclaimer it jkr not mine obviously a n the end to this chapter is kind of rough as in the writing be warned once i finish this story however long it takes i plan on going back and editing it properly and adding stuff here and there next chapter will involve the ball and ron scheme becomes clear only ron would think it could succeed i think i will take the chapter all the way until the second task thanks for the great reviews rasberry jo good call on ron becoming more pestering you ll see it next chapter ron will eventually come to accept harry and ginny well as much as ron ever could but he will still have other issues that will strain his and harry relationship accio698 dumbledore likes to be in control and know what is going on it will become more of issue and i plan it to come to a head during the summer after gof chapter 7 goblet of fire part iii the only talk in the common room that night was about the triwizard tournament and what people would do with a thousand galleons the only person who seemed uninterested in the tournament was hermione she was telling anyone willing to listen which was only harry ginny and ron so long as willing meant willing to stay still about how she felt house elves were not receiving fair treatment and that something needed to be done about it all three of them rather than paying attention to hermione were fantasizing about the tournament ron and ginny were wondering about what they would do with a thousand galleons while harry was thinking about winning and receiving fame that he felt like he had earned himself let see i dontneed a broom but i could use some new robes i could also get some jewelry but i ve never really cared for a lot of it anyway hmmm what is there ginny thoughts reached harry who crinkled his forehead ginny you do realize that you have far more than a thousand galleons dontyou harry sent along with the mental picture of the gold in the potter vault ginny blushed err well i was just thinking what i would do with gold that was mine that gold is yours it yours too harry felt ginny preparing to argue so he pressed ahead i inherited that money i did not earn it it is just as much yours as it is mine you are my ginny my wife i am yours gold hardly seems important after that ginny felt ashamed especially considering what she wanted to discuss with harry i sorry it just takes some getting used to is all she took a deep breath and looked into harry eyes harry i dontwant you to even try to enter the tournament promise me that you wonttry to get around whatever protections dumbledore uses harry could feel how much this meant to her and answered without hesitation i promise but why i mean it would be awesome to win and dumbledore would make sure things are safe would you want me to enter the question hit harry with the force of a physical blow he would not want ginny to enter not if there was any chance that she might get hurt no when did you get so wise i not wise she answered i just know you harry chuckled which earned him a glare from hermione who was still in the middle of her tirade about house elf rights ginny do you know your measurements of course why she tried to probe his mind but harry refused to allow her to find out what he was thinking you were right you do need new robes you ve um outgrown my old ones why dont you send off for some new ones and have the shop charge it to our vault but no buts ginny mouth dropped open in silent protest but she quickly closed it she knew when harry was not going to back down unfortunately hermione also caught ginny expression of protest ginny i shocked i thought you would understand it is not right how house elves are treated they re treated like slaves and its been going on for centuries why hasntanyone done anything about it now we really should think of something to help them hermione continued on her attention now focused on ginny harry and ron shared a look their first in a long time and silently agreed they both stood up and left unnoticed by hermione harry you re going to pay for this ginny threatened in his mind harry smiled and started getting ready for bed once in bed harry had the nagging feeling he had forgotten something ginny was still being lectured to by hermione so she was not any help finally he realized what it was sirius letter harry tore it opened and frowned sirius was coming north that meant he was leaving the relative safety of wherever he was guilt overwhelmed him he quickly got out of bed and began ruffling for a piece of parchment dear sirius please dontcome back i dontwant you to get caught because of me it was probably nothing anyway maybe it was just a bad dream anyway i wrote to dumbledore too so you donthave to worry stay safe harry the next few weeks passed quickly the one topic of conversation remained the tournament but the discussion had shifted from what it was to how the younger years were going to try and enter it fred and george had decided on an aging potion and some rather foolish third years were going to try simple disguises harry was enjoying the bustle and talk of the tournament for the first time he was not the center of attention and could simply observe harry and ginny began to notice things however that they believed were due to their mastering of their panther forms during their research they had discovered that animagi often developed traits or senses of their animal forms while still in the human forms they both found their hearing greatly improved along with greatly improved night vision if they had developed other traits they had not yet noticed nor did it appear that they had developed anything from their phoenix forms they guessed that it might take much longer or not happen at all since the phoenix was a magical creature perhaps the most interesting thing to result from these developments did not happen to them but rather the reactions of mrs norris and professor mcgonagall mrs norris would not go anywhere near them all it took was a look from either harry or ginny and the cat would quickly turn the other direction professor mcgonagall had also been acting strangely she kept giving them strange looks and seemed to take heavier breaths when she passed them but she had not said anything harry and ron relationship while drastically improved from the summer was still rather strained ginny and he were careful not to show too much affection when they were in sight of ron but the effort was annoying to both of them both he and ginny had realized from ron reaction that it probably would not be wise for them to reveal that they were soul bonded much less that they were husband and wife it went without saying that they planned not to reveal that they had slept together for most of a summer things got worse when ginny new school robes arrived ginny where did you get those asked ron who was eyeing her new black robe with suspicion ginny sighed for someone who was usually thick and unobservant ron had a way of noticing things that would only serve to irritate him where did i get what she retorted ron flushed red his temper was always close to the surface now you know what i mean where did you get those robes the glare ginny sent him should have told him to back off but ron stood resolutely waiting for her answer harry bought them for me ron face turned a deeper shade of red and his hands clenched you accepted them what wrong with you he moved forward as if to grab ginny robes but was stopped by a voice behind him you so much as touch her and you will regret it harry tone was deathly calm and held a chill that clearly conveyed his seriousness hermione watched from the other side of the corridor stunned she could not believe that they were going to row over robes well she could believe it it was not the argument that shocked her though it was the fact that harry had his wand out leveled at ron there was no doubt in her mind that if ron took another step toward ginny he would be hit by some kind of curse and judging from harry face it would not be a weak one she had to do something or bad things were going to happen what are you three doing we are going to be late for class announced hermione in a falsely irritated voice she knew that it sounded stupid and that everyone knew what was happening but she had to get them out of the area since they had already drawn a crowd she cringed when she heard a familiar snide voice start to speak well well well what do we have here is the weasel finally catching on that potter and his blood traitor of a sister are a couple how pathetic are you i dontknow why you re upset it is not like your family could sink any lower at least your sister has enough sense to cozy up to potter and his wealth sneered malfoy with a malicious grin harry whirled around to face malfoy and hermione and ginny moved to stand on either side of him malfoy the weasleys are a far better and far richer family than yours will ever be just look at your parents your father is nothing but a goon hiding behind a mask and your mother holds her nose so far up in the air i cantfigure out if she cantstand your smell or she hoping not to set eyes on you harry retorted and turned back around he was in no mood to deal with draco today and it would only land him in detention a sudden flash of white light streamed past his head and harry turned drawing his wand he almost dropped it when a gravely voice yelled out donteven think about it boy professor moody was standing behind him with his normal eye fixed on harry while the other was pointing toward goyle who had bent down to pick up a pure white ferret all you all right boy moody asked he didntget you did he er no sir harry answered good moody pointed his wand at the ferret which had tried to slink its way down the corridor toward the dungeons cowardly thing to do attacking someone back have you no honor whatsoever moody flicked his wand and the ferret began bouncing with each bounce the ferret flew higher you should be ashamed of yourself i bet moody was cut off by a worried sounding mcgonagall professor what are you doing with that ferret she was eyeing the white ferret with some trepidation teaching moody responded simply teaching how can you be that not a student is it when moody nodded harry thought his head of house just might explode we do not transfigure students as punishment we speak to their head of house surely dumbledore told you this yes he may have mentioned something about it but i thought a good shock would teach the lesson better perhaps the ferret was still bouncing as moody answered and with another flick of his wand malfoy transformed back into his loathsome self and began muttering your father hah yes i would actually like to meet your father we go way back i dare say he will be extremely happy to know i watching over his son but yes your head of house would be snape good another old friend i want to have a chat with with that moody marched down the corridor that led to the dungeons and malfoy scampered harry and ginny immediately burst into giggles ron had a huge grin on his face and his eyes were glazed over hermione however had a frown and started to say that mcgonagall was right but ron interrupted her oh come on hermione you know malfoy deserved it his own words seemed to sober him up and he looked at harry look harry ginny i sorry i i know i too sensitive about money harry smile got wider it looked like ron was finally overcoming his pride and jealousy dontworry about it just dontdo it again ron half smiled at them and they all left for class defense against the dark arts had quickly become everyone favorite class professor moody may look like he had been on the receiving end of too many curses but he knew his dada his lessons were also focused on the practical he would demonstrate the spells and then have everyone do them thus when they entered the defense classroom every one was excited at least until he announced the lesson today we will be studying the unforgivable curses moody growled at them the students from wizarding families and hermione all looked shocked the muggle borns who did not read as much as hermione did were interested but worried about their classmates reaction the unforgivable curses what are they they are illegal and carry a life sentence to azkaban ginny answered moody quickly moved on wipe those looks off your faces i know it harsh but you have to be aware you have to know what is out there dumbledore agrees that you are all old enough and mature enough to witness these curses you have to have constant vigilance moody yelled the last words but the class had been expecting it it was a constant refrain of moody and its shock value had worn off after the first few classes harry and ginny watched in silent horror while the rest of the class laughed at the antics moody made one of his demonstration spiders perform under the imperious curse they were both forcibly reminded of ginny experience in the chamber the next demonstration was even worse as they watched one of the spiders thrash under the cruciatus curse thankfully hermione interrupted that demonstration avada kedavra a green light shot from moody wand and impacted the spider it stopped moving a lifeless shell harry hung his head and wondered if that was how his parents had looked after voldemort had killed them ginny reached out and took his hand and gently squeezed it giving him silent support the next defense class moody managed to stun them all again by announcing that he would be performing the imperious curse on all of them most people watched in amusement as their classmates performed tricks or did things that they would normally never do hermione had been forced to act like a chipmunk much to her disgust and malfoy elation ron had skipped around the classroom three times and even now his right foot would occasionally move involuntarily harry and ginny had not been cursed ginny weasley moody called out you re next ginny stood and moved to the front with a frown on her face but determined never to be controlled imperio hop on one foot a voice said ginny found that she did not even have to fight for control this was nothing compared to the diary no the class and professor moody gaped in astonishment she had not simply fought the curse but thrown in completely very good miss weasley very good indeed you may return to your seat now how about your partner in crime eh mr potter harry trudged up to the front not eager to be cursed harry felt an odd sensation come over him it would have been pleasant had it not also interfered with his connection to ginny he heard a small quiet voice telling him to jump up on a desk but ignored it by now he was familiar with voices in his head or rather one voice in particular and this was not it no may i go back to my desk now sir harry asked something about the experience put him on edge moody praised him and sent him back to his desk before moving on to the rest of the class the professor did not seem to care for malfoy as he made him sing i a little teapot three times before lifting the curse hermione was no longer paying attention at this point though she was looking intently at harry and ginny backs their ability to throw the curse was another clue she was sure of it she glanced at ron and wondered how he did not think there was something strange going on other than harry liking ginny she sighed ron could be thick she was still a little worried that ron had not yet accepted harry and ginny although his behavior had improved dramatically looking away from ron hermione wondered when the books she had ordered would arrive unfortunately although the books were not terribly expensive they were difficult to locate and the book seller had informed her that it might be christmas before he could obtain copies of what she wanted oh well she thought maybe i ll just check the library again maybe i missed something everyone was lined up outside of hogwarts main doors waiting for the arrival of durmstrang and beauxbatons harry was excited like everyone else and was eagerly looking around for the schools delegations look over the forest squealed a young ravenclaw all eyes turned toward the direction the girl was pointing immediately the assembled students began murmuring what is it dragons no it a flying house yelled an excited but slightly disappointed colin creevey who had not been allowed to take his camera several students made fun of colin guess but he was not far off it was a large very large carriage led by four humongous horses professor dumbledore greeted the hagrid sized woman who had emerged from the carriage welcome madam maxime would you like to wait here for karkaroff or go inside and perhaps warm up dumbledore eyes twinkled at the newly arrived and shivering students harry watched with interest as the entourage headed up the steps and through the large doors and into the great hall they were made up of an equal number of boys and girls someone moaned behind him and harry turned he was surprised to see ron was the one who made the sound ron eyes were firmly locked on one of the female newcomers harry followed ron gaze and frowned looking around again he noticed that ron was not the only person staring at the girl er what going on ginny responded with the equivalent of a mental shrug ooooh look at hermione though ginny sent hermione was glaring daggers at the girl and then would throw a look of disgust at ron harry rolled his eyes harry and ginny were so caught up in the silent conflict that hermione was going through that they did not even notice drumstrang arrival until ron almost yelled out look it krum ron was right krum was one of the students with the delegation ginny glanced back at hermione and saw a look of relief was now on the older girl face she was obviously happy ron was back to his normal quidditch obsessive self the feast soon ruined hermione mood as ron was completely distracted by the new girl hermione only made snide comments about her which harry felt were mostly on the mark the girl had refused to remove her muffler until half way through the feast and complained about hogwarts for most of the meal harry snickered when ron fell all over himself to give the girl some strange french dish she a veela ron said almost to himself harry only cocked an eyebrow the girl or he supposed young lady was very pretty but not so pretty that she should be receiving the amount of attention she was receiving from the rest of the male population you know scary as it sounds ron might have a point she is receiving a lot of looks harry said hermione turned toward him with a stern look on her face please she not a veela besides its not like you are falling over yourself or goggling her harry wasnt affected by the veela at the world cup though inserted ginny who was enjoying hermione consternation are you saying that you didntfeel anything at the world cup i thought you just had good self control asked hermione she was now more interested in what harry was going to say than ron glazed eyes what do you mean feel anything why would i feel anything harry responded confused the look of suspicion that passed over hermione face made him think he had said something wrong that because you did ginny sent veela drive most men crazy only those who have very good self control or i suppose who are distracted can ignore veela the fact that you were able to ignore the group of veela in the forest probably wontcause any suspicion but all those veela in one place and on display on the field should have caused some reaction and hermione would know that you think it is because of our bond probably you know we might have to tell hermione soon she bound to figure it out soon later harry answered i dontknow what to say hermione i was more anxious for the match to start than to see the mascots perform i suppose i was just distracted said harry hoping to throw hermione off the scent the quick look that had been passed between harry and ginny did not go unnoticed by hermione but it was clear to her that they were not going to say anything so she decided to play along well i suppose so she was about to say something else when ron elbow knocked over a bowl but that does not explain ron and her harry and ginny got the impression that hermione wanted to call the new arrival something distinctly unfriendly as they exited the great hall harry looked back and saw the goblet of fire with the line dumbledore had drawn around it he sighed he would have like to have won the tournament and actually be known for something that was not related to voldemort ginny prodded him bringing him back to reality and he moved toward the doors only to be stopped by drumstrang headmaster karkaroff karkaroff looked like he was about to yell at harry for bumping into him when his eyes saw the lightening bolt scar he stared that right karkaroff that harry potter now move along sneered moody you re blocking the doors karkaroff eyes widened in what harry supposed was fear you you re here moody smile made his face look even more mangled me good to see that you remember now move along unless of course you want to extend this conversation karkaroff left quickly the common room was abuzz with people guessing about who would enter and become the hogwarts champion harry went to bed early but did not fall asleep he tossed and turned until well after he heard ron come up and add his snores to neville s harry meet me down in the common room ginny tone was tired but insistent harry followed her request without question and met her coming down the stairs sorry i didnt mean to keep you up to i dontknow what wrong harry apology was cut off by ginny hush harry just sit here on the couch with me as was so often the case just having ginny near him calmed him down ginny did not try to talk to him or figure out what was keeping him awake she already had a suspicion but knew that harry really did not understand what was bothering him curling up against his side she kissed him before placing her head on his chest and closing her eyes ginny was asleep within five minutes leaving harry awake but becoming sleepy himself he tightened his grip on ginny before he maneuvered himself and her into a more comfortable position harry soon joined her asleep neither of them considering the consequences of what might happen in the morning ron and hermione stared at the sleeping couple hermione glanced fearfully at ron awaiting his response instead of the expected rage ron face showed a far different expression it was close to the one he wore when playing chess he only frowned and left for breakfast hermione did not know whether to be impressed or worried harry and ginny were walking down the corridor to the great hall in surprise i cantbelieve ron didntsay anything said harry ginny nodded mutely he had to have seen us i mean ron is usually quick to breakfast but he couldnthave missed their surprise when ron did not mention anything to them at breakfast or indeed for the rest of the day he was a little quieter than was usual for ron but he was not hostile the tension in the great hall was incredibly thick as everyone waited for dumbledore to announce the tri wizard tournament champions the doors opened admitting the drumstrang and beauxbaton students karkaroff was already at the head table but madam maxime entered with hagrid i think he likes her hermione said ron stared at them and then said wow can you imagine if they had children they would be like hermione had elbowed him in the stomach silencing him he gave her a dirty look but did not say anymore harry and ginny snickered everyone seemed to be eating as fast as ron usually ate in the hope that if they finished early dumbledore would announce the champions sooner but dumbledore waited until the usual ending time of the feast before standing harry got the distinct impression that dumbledore enjoyed keeping the students in suspense there were several snickers and outright laughing when filch in his best coat came out carrying a coffin like box he carefully removed the goblet of fire setting it on top of the box before he left ah thank you mr filch said dumbledore the goblet changed colors and spat out a piece of paper dumbledore reached out and grabbed the parchment the first champion is from beauxbatons congratulations fleur delecore would you please stand and exit to the door on my left fluer stood and harry could not resist needling ron a little about who it was only a few seconds after fleur had left the hall the goblet sent out another piece of paper the next champion is from drumstrang we all congratulate victor krum and his selection now mr krum if you would said dumbledore waving his arm toward the door the silence in the great hall somehow become even quieter as the students awaited the announcement of the hogwarts champion dumbledore smiled down at the students and unfolded the last piece of parchment and our very own hogwarts champion from hufflepuff is cedric diggory the hufflepuff table exploded and the other three tables soon joined the ruckus with slightly less enthusiasm cedric had just left the great hall and dumbledore turned to follow when the goblet began sending off sparks and changing colors again everyone stared a piece of parchment issued from the goblet and dumbledore caught it absently and then with what looked like trepidation unfolded the parchment harry potter there was no applause indeed no noise at all as mouths dropped open and heads twirled to face harry who was just as shocked as everyone else mr potter if you would join the others dumbledore said without the usual twinkle in his eyes harry stood and numbly walked out of the hall ginny i promise i i know harry like you could keep something like this from me anyway besides you were with me all last night the internal discussion was stopped when karkaroff and madam maxime began angrily demanding explanations i demand that potter be removed or you allow us all to have two champions or or we will leave demanded karkaroff dumbledore sighed but was cut off by moody empty threat krum cantleave and potter has to compete binding magical contract remember convienet isntit potter is the only one here who should be complaining it would take a powerful dark wizard to confound the goblet but then i would not expect someone like you to understand that after all death alastor dumbledore voice intervened professor moody is right i afraid now he turned to harry mr potter did you enter the tournament or ask another older student to do so no sir i didnt enter and i have no intention of competing there was no way he was going to break his promise to ginny and moody supposition only reaffirmed his decision something was not right here i sorry harry but professor moody is correct you have to compete now if everyone is agreed on this point i think it is best that we all retire krum and fleur exited with their headmaster and mistress both of whom were in a huff dumbledore smiled at cedric and harry if i am not much mistaken you both should return to your towers as i believe there are many who wish to congratulate you they left together and reached a fork where harry had to go up the stairs and cedric down harry how did you enter asked cedric with obvious curiosity the story of the weasley twins beards had already spread like wildfire i didn t responded harry forcefully okay said cedric as he walked down the flight of stairs in obvious disbelief back in the gryffindor common room ginny had ron backed into a corner you can get out whatever jealous fantasy you have in your head harry did not enter i would know if he did besides she added in a lower voice i was with him all last night ron slumped against the wall and nodded mutely at his sister i didntthink that oh dontgive me that rubbish i saw your face so you had better not even think it harry did not enter ron nodded again and ginny now satisfied that ron would not make a fool of himself sat down and awaited harry return on his way back to the tower harry walk was interrupted by the arrival of an owl he quickly untied the letter from the owl leg and opened it dear harry nice try your scar hurting is only one thing in a series of events that have caught my attention i ve heard moody is teaching this year if he is then dumbledore is reading the signs too i want you to keep me updated if anything strange happens especially if your scar hurts again also make sure you tell dumbledore if it happens stay out of trouble mostly sirius harry smiled for the first time since his name was announced stay out of trouble mostly ha i bet that doesntinclude pranks and malfoy does have a little payback coming perhaps something white and ferret looking interjected ginny harry smiled that why i love you so long as i never get on your bad side what the amusement was evident in her tone you can be down right evil sometimes evil i not sure i like that much er well i mean a good kind of evil harry realized she was teasing and decided to do a little of his own but then i suppose the baby of the family would have to be a little evil to keep up with all those older brothers he knew she hated being called a baby especially when in reference to her brothers baby hmmm you had better be careful or i might prank you mr potter why prank me when we could prank malfoy together mrs potter i ll let you win this time harry smiled broadly and hurried back to the tower he was greeted by a loud cheer and clapping it seemed all of gryffindor was celebrating him being chosen as a champion even if he was not harry escaped as soon as he could practically running up the stairs to the dormitory have fun down there mate asked ron in a bemused voice harry turned toward ron surprised he knew that ginny had yelled at him but he still had not expected him to take her words to heart although happy ron did not believe he had entered the tournament ron calculating expression worried him ginny should i be worried not yet he just probably trying to figure out a way to break us up the next couple of weeks were rather miserable for harry the only positive thing that he felt like he had accomplished was the letter to sirius informing him of being entered into the tournament he eagerly awaited the reply the weighing of the wands ceremony had not gone well he had been corned by a rather repulsive reporter by the name of rita skeeter the resulting article cast him as the tragic hero and even said he cried himself to sleep at night he sighed and supposed it would not have been overly bad if people like malfoy had never read it besides now being called a cry baby by the slytherins the ferret had had produced badges with the legend support cedric diggory the real hogwarts champion malfoy had not stopped there but had added another message potter stinks the second message did not bother harry all that much and he was rather amused that malfoy could not come up with anything more creative malfoy had been quite putout when harry had mentioned this lack of creativity it was hogsmeade weekend and they were all eating breakfast hurriedly harry planned on using the invisibility cloak to go with the others he was very tired of being the brunt of jokes and rude gestures from the other houses harry decided to make sure that he did not repeat the mistakes he made last year when sneaking out he said goodbye to ron hermione and ginny and then went back to the dormitory making sure that snape saw him once he made sure he was alone he transformed and flamed to into the underground tunnel leading to honeydukes he quickly exited the tunnel after making sure the invisibility cloak covered his entire body they eventually found their way to the three broomsticks when they sat down hermione pulled out what looked to be a large shoebox she beamed at all three of them or rather ron and ginny and then the empty space that was harry i think it is time we took action to help the oppressed house elves ginny moaned in harry mind so i ve decided to found s p e w spew asked a fearful wrong no not spew s p e w it stands for the society for the protection of elvish welfare now as the founding members we will all hold a position founding members ron ejaculated his fearful expression during to abject panic yes ron founding members i will be the president you will be vice president since you ve shown the most enthusiasm ron face clearly showed that he was wondering how hermione had somehow switched horror for enthusiasm ginny you can be secretary as you have the best handwriting next to mine harry she began whispering you are treasurer ron had just slipped harry a butterbeer under his cloak and muttered something about them all needing a stiff drink when hagrid and moody walked in hermione eyes lit up when she saw them hagrid professor moody the two professors turned and walked to the table how would you like to join s p e w we are fighting for elf rights hagrid looked at her in undisguised shock but moody leaned near harry ear and muttered nice cloak potter harry nearly fell out of his seat moody must have motioned or said something to hagrid that harry did not hear as he righted himself because hagrid soon leaned down supposedly looking at a pamphlet hermione had seemingly made appear out of the thin air harry meet me at eleven i ve got somin interesting to show you hermione continued pressing her case but both professors refused to join s p e w to her annoyance after the professors left harry made his way back to the honeydukes tunnel and then walked his way back to hogwarts as he was afraid that he might flame in front of someone harry was a little worried as he made his way to hagrid hut something about the way hagrid said interesting worried him it also worried ginny ginny had used it as an excuse to keep a close watch on harry from above she was currently circling high above him in her phoenix form knocking on hagrid door harry was surprised to find that hagrid was dressed for what seemed like a date just stay under the cloak and keep close arry he said when madam maxime joined him the mystery was solved it was a date harry wondered why hagrid wanted him to tag along but followed them into the forest nevertheless from above ginny surveyed the area when she began scouting the forbidden forrest she could not believe it dragons no they wouldn t wouldntwhat harry asked a little worried that hagrid had somehow managed to acquire another dragon egg there are dragons here and hagrid is heading right toward them harry cautiously followed hagrid and gasped when he peeked over the ridge i ve got a bad feeling about this ginny just then one of the dragon roared and several dragon handlers harry had not seen shot stunners at them one of them he was shocked to see was charlie weasley harry shock and trepidation grew as charlie explained what the dragons were for his worst fears confirmed in charlie distraction he did not notice that the hungarian hornatail was waking back up ginny however was paying attention and quickly dived down just as the horntail opened is jaws and lunged for her older brother the red phoenix hurled itself past the front of the dragon distracting it the dragon however did not go after the phoenix but cocked its head and stared at the phoenix it seemed to be puzzled at the phoenix arrival when ginny began to trill the dragon sat back down on its haunches and made no further moves to go after any of the dragon handlers harry looked around the hallway in front of the fat lady before announcing the all clear to ginny she flamed into existence next to him and quickly transformed and they made their way into the common room the first thing harry did was right to sirius again the idea of facing dragons was nerve racking and he wanted help they briefly discussed the idea of using a phoenix either harry or ginny but decided that revealing their forms would probably cause more problems than it was worth however it was the backup plan what about cedric ginny asked i think i should tell him madam maxime will tell fleur and you said that you thought you saw karkaraoff lurking in the forest too so krum will know it only fair ron and hermione were stunned and quickly agreed to help research ways to get passed a dragon unfortunately they had not been able to find anything even the letter from sirius had not helped that much only saying that he would be in contact again soon a few days harry saw cedric passing through the hallway and judging from his direction probably going to herbology harry turned toward the others and said i ll catch up ron and hermione look puzzled but ginny nodded and led the other two away by the elbows taking careful aim at cedric bag harry muttered relashio causing a split to form on the bag and several books and ink bottles to fall out cedric gave a great sigh and then told his companions to go on that he would meet up with them hey cedric harry said rushing up to him and ignoring cedric attempt to say he did not need help with his stuff the first task it dragons they ve got one for each of us and we have to get past them cedric stopped putting stuff into his bag and paled slightly why are you telling me maxime and karkaroff saw them so fleur and krum will know it fair this way cedric nodded said thanks and left quickly when he saw professor moody come around the corner potter moody growled come with me they silently walked other than the sound of moody wooden leg to moody office sit said moody and indicated a chair with his hand professor i harry began dontworry about it cheating is a tradition of the tournament and always will be no matter what dumbledore would like to believe what you did however was a very noble thing why did you do it moody seemed to be genuinely interested in harry motives and seemed to be measuring him up with his one good eye harry shifted uncomfortably it was only fair professor he really did not know what else to say moody seemed to consider this and nodded yes i suppose it is do you have any idea how to get past the dragon harry shook his head no well i not going to tell you how but i will give you a bit of advice play to your strengths harry frowned and wondered why moody had emphasized the word play i dontreally have any strengths other than quidditch wait once harry had said quidditch his thoughts had immediately gone to his firebolt it was so simple moody smiled his gruesome smile you are a quick one well you better go here a note excusing you for being late the remaining weeks that led up to the first task were far more pleasant than the previous harry suspected cedric had told the hufflepuffs and ravenclaws to back off because they were no longer sporting the support cedric diggory badges the slytherins continued to be awful but then they were always that way currently harry was pacing in front of the common room fire waiting for sirius head to appear in the fire sirius had written a cryptic note saying to wait by the fire at 1 00 ginny eyes followed harry back and forth as he paced finally she stood and grabbed his arm harry sit she commanded you are going to drive me crazy if you keep do that dontworry i sure sirius is fine she pulled harry down with her as she sat and forced him to stay sitting by placing her head in his lap she knew harry would not disturb her by moving and they still had fifteen minutes until one sighing at the situation harry had no choice but to accept it with the position ginny had taken instead of fidgeting harry began playing with ginny hair he could never figure out why but playing with ginny hair always seemed to relax him ginny smiled as she felt both harry body and his mind relax and allowed herself to enjoy harry manipulation of her hair while harry found playing with ginny hair relaxing ginny found it arousing after a few minutes she could not stand it any longer and gently grabbed harry wrist and brought it toward her mouth and kissed the back of his palm shivers of pleasure seemed to spread from where ginny had kissed his hand and harry moved his other hand under her head moving his head down and bringing up ginny unresisting head with his hand he kissed her neither of them noticed when the fire changed to green and sirius head appeared sirius opened his mouth and then shut it smirking he had heard from harry letters and dumbledore that his godson and ginny were an item reading between the lines he had begun to suspect that there was more to it than boyfriend and girlfriend now watching the two enthusiastically snogging his suspicions were confirmed he decided to interrupt when harry moved from ginny lips to her neck ginny had moaned and moved her bent her neck to give him better access yes if he did not interrupt he was a little worried he might see something he did not want to see my my what do we have here sirius called out softly it had the desired effect both harry and ginny sprung to sitting positions narrowly missing each others heads by centimeters sirius let out a barking laugh and then said all right play time is over both and harry and ginny blushed i want to talk to you i ve been hearing some disturbing things too many strange things have been happening ginny began listing them almost without thinking we know first harry scar hurts then the death eaters at the world cup the incident at moody does that qualify as strange and of course harry been entered into the tri wizard tournament oh and hermione has been harping on us about spew spew asked sirius momentarily distracted with her best hermione voice ginny said not spew s p e w it a society she formed for advancing house elf rights she been nuts about it since crouch fired winky crouch barty crouch harry and ginny nodded that is strange i not sure it connected though tell me more harry and ginny related the story to sirius who seemed to grow even more concerned as the story ended you say crouch is now there for the tournament well keep an eye on him he not one to be a death eater but it is a strange coincidence for nearly an hour they talked with sirius he liked the idea of using the firebolt to get past the dragon harry could not help thinking that it was a good thing that they had just learned the accio charm in charms he did suggest that harry could use the conjuctivitus curse if the firebolt did not work harry joined cedric fleur and krum inside a tent where bagman had just had them choose which dragon they were going to face harry shook his head as he looked at the miniature dragon just my luck that i would get the horntail focus on your firebolt and dontpanic ginny tone was calming but he could still hear the underlying panic at his situation listening to the others go before him was absolutely nerve racking if he had been scared before listening had only increased his worries by at least ten times he heard bagman call his name and took a deep breath it was time he stepped out through the fold in the canvas and found himself face to face with an obviously irritated dragon raising his wand he called out accio firebolt and feverously hoped it would come at first he thought the charm had failed then he heard several surprised yells and screams and his firebolt zoomed over to him and stopped by his side smiling in triumph and momentarily forgetting that he had to face a dragon harry mounted the broom and kicked off leaning forward he dove for the golden egg only to have to pull up and perform a sloth grip roll to avoid the dragon fire and then its tail again he tried this time he fainted in one direction and went the other the dragon however was not fooled and he narrowly avoided being burned not willing to give up harry soared just above the dragon reach and began circling the horntail head followed his every movement harry smiled when he figured it out he would have to be careful but he thought he might be able to lure her away from her eggs harry was just about to fly slightly hire and force her to unfold her wings when the dragon looked directly into his eyes if harry did not know better he would have said the dragon looked surprised and then ashamed the horntail refolded her wings and sat back on her haunches all aggressiveness gone harry flew down to the floor and dismounted somehow knowing the dragon would not attack when he began to walk toward the eggs however the dragon shifted uneasily harry stopped when he sensed her unease not knowing what to do harry pointed at the golden egg trying to tell the very protective dragon that he wanted that one the horntail cocked its head at harry and then looked at the egg and narrowed its eyes harry again move toward the egg but stopped when the dragon snout descended instead of roasting harry which he had momentarily feared the dragon nudged the fake egg from her nest towards harry very cautiously harry lifted the egg and looked back at the dragon feeling like he should say something er thank you with that he left through another tent fold to total silence except for one small snicker coming from ginny dumbledore watched transfixed as harry walked out with the egg without so much as a scratch on him he had never seen anything like what had just happened dragons did not surrender their eggs the only creatures dragons ever showed respect for with phoenixes most scholars assumed it was because the phoenix was a creature of fire one of the few natural forces dragons respected dumbledore shook his head trying to figure it out harry had called fawkes to him in the chamber of secrets dumbledore mused perhaps there was a larger connection there than he thought maybe it was not the fire that dragons respected maybe it was something more innate looking behind him at ginny dumbledore wished not for the first time legilimancy worked on her and harry it was frustrating he was not used to not knowing what his students were thinking without legilemancy it made keeping them out of trouble much more difficult deciding it would be best to pretend that nothing was amiss he raised his wand and drew a large number ten in the air
