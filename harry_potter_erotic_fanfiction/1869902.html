 temporal flux chapter one a familiar stranger taking a deep breath a young man of sixteen years old was preparing to go to platform 9 with his false documents in hand he was gazing at himself in front of the mirror wondering if he was going to be able to get away with it his brown eyes were too much like hers his hair was the exact same shade as hers but with a different consistence clearing his throat he said with a well rehearsed american accent good morning where might i find platform 9 he shook his head cleared his throat and repeated his words again with some modification morning where platform 9 he wished he didnthave to use the accent at all because it sounded dreadful he had little choice he was told on more than one occasion that his voice sounded just like his father s here goes nothing he muttered that the spirit dear the mirror told him sarcastically i ve heard americans talk and you re not going to get away with it shut it he ordered the mirror with annoyance he pulled at a chain around his neck and stuffed the pendant under his shirt he picked up the handle of his trunk it had wheels to make it easy to transport giving him more of a muggle born appearance with some trouble he got his trunk to the bottom of the staircase to the pub area of the leaky cauldron he paid for his room and went off to find a floo network to get to the station i wonder if harry all right said hermione worriedly to her red haired companions he hasntwritten us all summer ron sighed as he adjusted his prefect pin which was upside down it flipped back over he took it off all together and stuffed it into his pocket you cantblame him if he didntwant to write to us i wish we knew something if i knew anything i d tell him this time i even wrote that i d tell him anything i knew over the summer but he never wrote back professor dumbledore said that he was fine said ginny i mean that he was staying at his aunt house harry blaming himself for what happened to sirius hermione bit her lip as she saw someone unfamiliar coming along pulling a trunk on wheels he looked about their age he was tall just as tall as ron with a similar body structure he looked a little confused excuse me are you all right she asked the boy blinked at her with surprise he opened his mouth and he attempted to say something but couldn t he seemed transfixed on her face what the matter mate you look lost said ron just behind hermione the boy head whipped to look at ron and he gulped um yes i mean i think i lost he stammered nervously i looking for the train to my school he saw the prefect pin on hermione collar you re american arentyou asked hermione how old are you i sixteen replied the boy and yes i american i on a special exchange program with a school in england by any chance would you be going to that school most of this was just an act he knew perfectly well who the people he was speaking with his skin was tingling from the air i didntknow that there was an exchange program said ron thoughtfully what your name jared blake replied the boy it nice to meet you and you are ron weasley this is hermione granger and my sister ginny answered ron introducing the two girls i guess we ll help you thanks said jared with some relief as he followed them feeling his excitement build he would have never gotten away with that before he had to remind himself that they didntknow him at least not yet the platform is between platforms nine and ten all you need to do is to go through the divider run a little first if you re not sure instructed hermione and you should be fine we have to go back to our parents good luck she gave him a smile as all three of them walked off jared smiled back at her ginny glanced back at a little as her brother and hermione continued walking there was something strangely familiar with that boy she shook her head as she turned and noticed they were way ahead of her hey wait for me she exclaimed jared continued onward until he was through the divider he knew where it was the whole time but his conversation with ron hermione and ginny gave him a chance to assess the situation it was disconcerting seeing them as peers rather than authority figures he had one pressing question in his mind where was harry potter he got his answer as soon as he went through the divider harry was by himself apparently he had arrived early jared was a little taken because harry wasntlike himself harry was loading his trunk without any assistance and looked like he was unwilling to speak with anyone jared remembered that it wasnta good time for harry sighing jared walked up to him because it was the section to load his trunk in excuse me said jared quietly harry moved out of his way and allowed him to put his trunk in place he was just about to leave when he heard harry voice i ve never seen you before you look too old to be a first year i not i an exchange student from america my name is jared blake harry potter harry held his breath waiting for the usual sweep for his scar when jared eyes didntweaver he was a little surprised are you by yourself yes my parents are very busy well i ll see you on the train jared walked onto get the train he wanted to go early because there was a specific compartment that he liked he also wanted to avoid running into other people for a while it was a mind trip seeing ron harry hermione and ginny he needed to settle himself for a while finding his favorite compartment jared took a seat and was smiling with great satisfaction that it wasntoccupied he stared out the window and watched as ron and hermione caught up with harry there is tension between the best friends as they try to catch up in a few words about harry summer they got on the train as ginny had a brief conversation with her mother jared could almost tell what mrs weasley is saying take care and dontget into any trouble make sure that your brother and his friends are all right you ll write me and tell me otherwise right yes that was exactly what she was telling her and jared was positive of it he continued to stare out the window as someone knocked on the compartment jared turned his head in a daze hullo i was wondering if you mind me sitting here the other compartments are filling up fast jared knew who it was but he looked a bit different than what he remembered sure no problem said jared after realizing that neville longbottom wanted an answer from him thanks i neville longbottom jared blake i the exchange student from america it nice to see a friendly face so you re just starting hogwarts this year it a year long exchange what that asked jared referring to the plant that neville was carrying in the leaves a toad was sitting held down by what looked like vines oh this is my mimbulus mimbletonia and my toad trevor replied neville dontget too close though it will squirt you it does it with strangers oh said jared lightly remembering neville love of plants it very nice i donteven have a familiar i was thinking of getting an owl when i got there my parents gave me money for one but i not sure what i want to get neville there you are said luna lovegood as she peered into the compartment do you mind if i sit here she had her wand tucked into her ear as she stared at jared oh i didntknow you were talking to someone that was rude of me i luna lovegood nice to meet you said jared jared blake the american exchange student he said the last part almost wryly he was going to get tired of introducing himself after a while perhaps he should have had some business cards printed up it would have made things a lot easier if not less annoying have a seat he offered luna took the seat next to him you look awfully familiar though i cantplace you she said as she gazed at him maybe it the doppelganger theory i dontthink i have a twin anywhere else in the world said jared with a nervous laugh he didntlike the fact that she was able to look like she could see right through him much to his relief harry showed up carrying two cages with his owl hedwig and another containing ron owl pig ginny had a carrier with crookshanks in it jared nearly laughed at the poor half kneazle crookshanks had his face pressed up against the wired door of the carrier squashing his already squashed face even more come on in he said very thankful for their intrusion thanks jared i guess you got acquainted with other people already said ginny cheerfully does anyone mind if i let crookshanks out he not very happy how will you get him back inside asked neville gazing at feline we ll stuff him back in later said harry as he put the owls in the open overhead compartment pig was being his usual hyperactive self twittering from bar to bar of his cage hedwig was turning her head away from the irritating owl and pretending like she didntknow him harry gently stroked her feathers and she hooted i sorry about this we ll be there soon hedwig she hooted at him softly crookshanks was padding around the compartment floor he seemed very interested in jared rubbing up against the boy shins jared without thinking picked up crookshanks who didnteven hiss at him jared gently rubbed the feline ears causing crookshanks to purr like a motor engine wow i ve never seen hermione cat take such a liking to someone so quickly complimented ginny with some amazement jared looked a little startled but his expression softened my mother had a cat like this one he died when i was little he explained he was my buddy when we d go exploring the house where are the other two oh you mean ron and hermione they re at the prefect compartment they should be coming here as soon as they re done with business answered ginny harry had taken his place by the window which neville offered him without saying a word he was gazing out the window luna was no longer interested in jared but in harry jared wasntoverly concerned with harry knowing that it would be sorted out later so he continued rubbing crookshanks ears he knew that his presence there would prevent the others from prying and asking harry about how he was doing somehow jared knew that harry would be grateful for it ginny who jared knew was never comfortable with long silences broke it after a few minutes so how was your summer luna you wrote me about going to sweden did you find anything not really answered luna it was mildly disappointing but my father and i looked at the old evidence from before the girls filled the silence with talk about luna strange creatures jared was grinning as he remembered the repeated warnings that his mother used to tell him when he was small it was a wonder why his mother and luna were friends some pretty bad things out there murmured jared getting harry attention i read all about it my parents didntwant me to come at all but i really had no choice harry stared at him for a moment did you want to ask me anything there was a definite mark of hostility in his voice come on what did you want to ask me harry calm down said ginny there no need to get angry no it all right said jared he has every right to be angry this is one screwed up world some just get hit more than others i sorry if i sounded too forward i didntmean anything by it harry features softened at his words he swallowed what anger he had towards him i sorry it just that i know that people are going to ask like they did last year we ll be with you neville reassured him i mean ron and i will be in the dorms ron and hermione can give people detention for pestering you i dontthink hermione would said jared ron might but not her how do you know that you only met them for less than five minutes scoffed ginny jared shrugged his shoulders he was a quick thinker and said because when i met with you three he wasntwearing his badge i didnteven know he was a prefect until you and harry came in he really wanted to say that he knew them pretty well intimately actually but he couldntif he wanted to keep his cover harry had more of an appreciation of jared at that point i dontthink hermione and ron should be assigning detention on my behalf i tired of people doing stuff on my behalf i sick of it the others were quiet again for nearly fifteen minutes before neville decided to take a stab at some conversation almost an hour past before ron and hermione showed up hello oh i see everyone met jared greeted hermione hermione move so i can get a seat ordered ron as he gave her a little push he was so much bigger than her she was only around five and half feet tall while ron towered over her at just over six feet tall jared watched with mild amusement not knowing if he should shake his head at them or laugh out loud you could say excuse me retorted hermione you re just mad because malfoy is still a prefect arentyou he called you a mudblood during the meeting and you just let him now move countered ron angrily hermione obligingly moved out of his way and he took a seat next to neville while hermione took hers next to ginny besides there no point in fighting malfoy he just saying it to get a rise out of me why should i make him think he winning by reacting that your problem ron he d leave us all alone much more if you wouldntreact to every single thing he does or says jared was experiencing a moment of d j vu as he remembered getting an almost similar speech when he was younger he fought the compulsion to recite it along with hermione ron averted the would be argument by waving his hand dismissively he turned his attention to a more pressing matter so how are you doing harry neville and ginny seized up fine replied harry automatically jared shifted a little as he continued to look out the window ignoring the tension all together he wasntworried at all because he simply knew better he also didntwant to interfere with what was happening if the three of them wanted to fight they were going to fight right said ron with a nod are you sure harry pressed hermione jared almost predicted that she never knew when to leave well enough alone but it was one of the things that he loved about her he said he fine hermione insisted ron that was also a response that jared expected it was almost like a patterned script that jared was used to this was just the normal way ron and hermione communicated but jared knew better they were more than capable of just bickering back and forth like an old married couple hermione looked like she wanted to say something else but decided to leave it be there was no doubt in jared mind that ron and hermione were going to be discussing it later on so jared where in america are you from jared turned his head huh oh i from los angeles in california all the way in the west coast this must be quite a change of climate for you said hermione i ve never been to california before it pretty hot during the summer agreed jason and it doesntsnow there you have to go elsewhere but there are lots of different cultures in one place you donthave to go far to get tastes of mexico china and lots of other countries so who needs snow he wasntlying he knew a lot of different places in the world because his parents and he went on vacations to various places they spent two weeks in california before so jared had experience to draw from it was all part of his persona as an american what kind of schools do they have in america asked ginny picking up on the topic well we dontreally have much in the way of boarding schools because it very expensive for most people so most of our schools are just during the day at the end of the day we go home to our families my parents were a little worried about sending me to hogwarts but i convinced them that it worth the experience i hope to broaden my horizons so that why i here didntyour parents know about you know who coming back asked neville we were in the ministry of magic just before school let out last year less than a year he wasntbragging he was warning jared i know replied jared as he continued to rub crookshanks ears hermione stared at her cat who was purring like mad he noticed that she was staring oh i sorry this is your cat you want him back no that all right whispered hermione as she glanced at ginny who shrugged i cantbelieve that stupid cat likes him muttered ron he not stupid ron exclaimed hermione defensively that cat looks like he ran into a wall hermione he retorted he not a normal cat i think he out to get me actually he at least half kneazle remarked jared he smarter than the average cat but i dontthink he out to get anyone kneazles are very loyal animals they are at least loyal to their owners and they protect their owners especially their personal space ron looked flabbergasted at the last part of jared explanation you really think crookshanks is half kneazle asked hermione great two know it alls in one place how did i end up here muttered ron as he threw his hands into the air nearly knocking neville plant and toad off his lap i sorry neville or maybe crookshanks doesntlike you because you dontlike him pointed out jared ginny and luna started giggling if you made an effort you two could get along ron face turned red as he glared at jared now hermione was giggling along with the other two girls who the bloody hell do you think you are demanded ron jared looked a little taken back by ron reaction he knew that he had probably gone too far you need to learn how to take a joke he said placating him i have a problem with my impulse control i get it from my father at least that what my mother tells me i also have his temper it seemed kind of odd that anyone would share that kind of information with near strangers it was a lapse on jared part they didntknow him yet so what does a prefect do exactly hermione glanced at ron as he slumped into his grumpy mode you see we re in charge of the other students and we help them our school is on a point system there are four houses gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff and slytherin you dontwant to get into slytherin put in ginny hermione continued each house has certain characteristics and depending on your personality and what the sorting hat says that where you ll go i ron ginny neville and harry are in gryffindor while luna is in ravenclaw each house acts as your family while you are at hogwarts i see said jared he stopped rubbing crookshanks ears which the half kneazle didntreally appreciate he hissed at jared oh i sorry crookshanks that all right crookshanks you ve gotten enough attention from him already come here said hermione gently crookshanks jumped off jared lap and went over to hermione but stayed at her feet harry quietly announced we re almost there why dontwe get our robes on jared was the only one who wasntscrambling to get them on ron fumbled with his prefect pin again exasperating hermione thoroughly she grabbed it from him and pinned it on his chest for him jared had seen a scene like that so many times there just leave it alone ron ordered hermione that pin is like your head hermione has to straighten both of them out quipped ginny jared chuckled what is this pick on ron day stop it before i give you detention snapped ron as he glared at ginny detention i your little sister how could you even consider giving me detention asked ginny with mock shock fine i could give you detention you dontneed to be in gryffindor for that said ron as he threw a glare jared way you re the one who started the whole thing jared opened his mouth to defend himself but he realized that he couldntsay it if ron knew who he was he wouldntbe able to bring himself to even give jared detention he shut his mouth instead instead he decided to put on his robes it was only a matter of time before he had to really get to work time was relative though but jared knew that he had taken a big gamble coming the train came to a stop hermione and ron were the first ones out of their compartment he stared at them wondering which one of them would be the target an it not that hard to figure out who jared is he smart as his mother but he got a lot of his father in him he certainly making a good impression there will be ron and hermione moments but not right away i going back to my ron and hermione roots there is a lot of background history to go over along with some questions to answer things are being seen from jared perspective as for the title it sucks but i ve never been good with titles also for those of you who are following veritas it has been put on hold because of the new canon material that j k rowling

cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter ten the raven jared packed up his school bag with some supplies for the campout he wasnttoo worried about being outdoors rather he was more concerned about being in close quarters with ron and harry who were watching him carefully after they had returned from quidditch practice hermione was doing the same thing jared was being as quiet as possible and trying to draw as little attention as possible it wasntworking are you done asked harry as he watched crookshanks pad his way into the dorm room he been coming over a lot i guess he likes me said jared with a shrug as crookshanks rubbed up against his shins he didntreally have it in him to tell crookshanks to go away ron strolled in drying his hair he took one look at crookshanks and jared and shook his head jared didntbother to ask what was wrong it was a good idea that he didnt tell ron that he was his son at this point in time jared somehow doubted that ron was thinking about having any children jared decided it was best to stay out of ron way we should get down soon said harry hermione waiting for us come on ron give me a sec said ron as he buttoned up the front of his shirt for a fleeting moment jared remembered sitting on top of a hamper watching his father getting ready for the day ron always buttoned up his shirt last he didntwear ties that often for work the only thing really missing was ron aftershave that hermione would eventually get for him jared shook his head and picked up his bag crookshanks followed him out ron and harry quickly joined jared on the stairs hermione was patiently waiting for them on one of the soft cushiony chairs she glanced down to see crookshanks practically refusing to leave jared side why are you always with him crookshanks asked hermione mildly crookshanks meowed at her but really couldntgive an answer and why do you let him she directed to jared like i said i had a part kneazle when i was growing up he died when i was five but we had a lot of fun together we spent one afternoon hiding my father chess pieces answered jared he must have not been too happy when he got back said hermione as she got to her feet no he wasntparticularly thrilled agreed jared he couldntreally yell at me or our part kneazle i was two and he was just old my mother wouldntlet him let go down for breakfast i starving they all trooped down to the great hall almost everyone was a touch nervous about going off and camping out one could have easily predicted that the house that was going to have the most trouble would be slytherin and this would have been a very correct assumption they spent the most time grumbling about it because professor de luca simply didntgive anyone enough time to prepare for the outdoor conditions pansy was the first of the slytherins girls to voice her complaints now most of the girls from the other houses agreed with her at least mildly but she was such a horrible person that no one was about to support her or her whining draco moaned over having to sleep on the ground but really had nothing to threaten with the house that was handling the campout best was gryffindor harry was used to not sleeping in the best of conditions after living with the dursleys for years he had developed the highest tolerance to discomfort out of all of the gryffindors ron was used to sharing his living space with more than one person dean seamus and neville had about the same amount of tolerance besides the boys had spent six years living together in one room so they didntseem much of a difference hermione was all right with the campout it was lavender and parvati who had problems neither girl ever had to sleep on the ground before because they had come from wizarding families hermione father had taken her out camping on more than one occasion and argued that the campout would be an excellent learning experience for everyone meanwhile jared kept to himself except for giving some looks towards ginny she knew what she was going to have to do as soon as the sixth years left she had kept the picture in a safe place as well as keeping a visual memory of it in her mind jared and ginny couldntlook at each other for very long because of ron suspicious glances professor de luca walked into the great hall with a huge grin on his face that made all the sixth years very uncertain good morning everyone he greeted jovially what so good about it said ron out loud which was followed by many murmurs of agreement he said exactly what jared was thinking it a beautiful day and there not a cloud in the sky that something to be happy about replied de luca without dropping his grin jared shrugged his shoulders harry had an odd feeling of d j vu as he glanced at jared because he was wearing the same expression as ron in fact jared was unconsciously leaning the same way harry was sitting next to ron but across from jared he glanced at ron for a moment then at jared wearing an expression of utmost confusion he turned his head and saw that ginny was staring straight at him she had the expression of a cat that had swallowed a very large canary and didnthave any trouble getting it down her look was reminiscent of either fred or george if that didntmake harry suspicious jared also sat next to hermione harry blinked to refresh his eyes as he glanced at ron then hermione and finally jared once again he stole a glance at ginny who gave him a smirk and harry probably just imagined her nod of confirmation harry are you all right asked hermione noticing the look on his face i fine just fine replied harry automatically jared stared at him too ron wasntpaying much attention leave him alone hermione he told her jared was more in tuned than ron and knew that there was something wrong ginny cleared her throat at that moment to get everyone attention professor de luca went over the rules of the campout before they could get their gear outside the school was providing tents that each of the houses had to put up the rules were as followed the houses would compete for both house points as well as grades any sabotage would not be tolerated and the boys and girls were to not to mix in each others tents these rules left too much room for other things to happen jared was the first one to the section marked off for the gryffindor boys followed by the others the boys stared awkwardly at each other for a moment but then eyes fell on ron simply because he was a prefect ron grabbed a bucket i going to go and get some water for everyone he volunteered i ll go with you offered neville what about the rest of us asked jared ron studied the rest of the boys and asked dean and seamus you guys went to the world cup before and so you do know how to pitch a tent sure we do answered seamus as dean nodded with him we ll pitch the tent we should go out and get some firewood pointed out harry as he glanced at jared who nodded slowly meet back here as soon as possible said ron as everyone depart in their respective directions hermione and the other gryffindor girls met up with him and after a brief chat hermione went with ron and neville to get water lavender and parvati choose to assemble the tents with seamus and dean harry took the initiative and led the way purposefully leading jared as far away from the others as possible jared followed him silently for five minutes before he noticed that harry wasnt picking up any wood he stopped and noticed that they were just entering the forbidden forest of course jared had been in there before but was feeling more nervous because harry was deliberately walking in he was the one who had warned jared numerous times about going into the forest where are we going arentwe supposed to be picking up fire wood asked jared in a whisper harry didntrespond he merely continued with jared slowing down behind him as soon as they could no longer hear any voices harry stopped and pivoted suddenly causing jared to stumble back his heels tripped a root as he fell back however harry hand grabbed his wrist just in time i asked you before about hermione by the tree said harry in a deadly calm voice without releasing jared wrist in fact he tightened his hold jared visibly winched you said that you were in loved her i want to know exactly who you are right now let me go hissed jared through his teeth i didntdo anything wrong and you re wrong i said i loved her i didntsay that i was in love with her ron is not me i love her and so do you we just dontlove her the same way there was a puzzling look on harry face as he reluctantly released jared from his grasp i have a feeling i ve met you before admitted harry slowly everything about you seems so familiar but it different all mixed up jared sighed harry was so much calmer than ginny but how was he supposed to explain himself what is it about me whispered jared maybe harry wasntnoticing as much you look so familiar but it impossible answered harry as he focused his eyes on jared his eyes were taking in all of him but it your eyes they look a lot like hermione s that because they are hers i got them from her the hair and skin coloring too jared held his breath waiting for harry reaction his green eyes because as large as saucers as he started walking around jared oh my god exclaimed harry after a minute and on the second time he walked around how now it was harry turn to stumble back but jared stopped him jared decided to put all the cards on the table without ginny there he needed someone to cover for him and only harry could do it jared had no choice but to break up the trio he started to speak in his natural voice complete with his accent his voice didntvary much from his father s listen to me very carefully and stop yelling like that you re going to draw attention to us they ll think i attacking you or something harry mouth opened a bit as he stared at jared you sound exactly like ron it had never occurred to harry that he sounded like his own father too most of the time a person voice sounded different in their heads compared to how everyone else hears them but you re something that hermione would say my parents are the last people who should be coming here right now said jared calmly now are you willing to listen to me you ve got my attention completely there too much to explain right now and they ll be expecting us to come back with the wood at any moment so i ll make this as quickly as possible why dontwe collect the wood while you explain yourself fine as they collected the wood jared summed up almost everything that had happened he mentioned that ginny knew but was very curious as to how harry figured it out how did you know i didn t admitted harry as he stooped down to get a piece of wood i was wondering about what you said at the tree dontworry i didnttell ron or hermione i dontknow how hermione would have handled it but i pretty sure that ron would have been angry thanks i dontknow why i say the things that i do i very impulsive and a smart mouth my mother says that i get it from her well that explains why you called ron a freak but if he your father that doesntmake much sense he was accusing me of stuff i got defensive and it was just so easy to antagonize him i didntknow that they d start fighting like that but he was being stupid jared sounded very petulant and stubborn harry sighed because he could see a glimmer in jared eyes that was nearly identical to hermione whenever she was insistent about being right about something how do your parents stand you in the future muttered harry picking up another piece of wood and handing it to jared i have no idea my dad wonders how he does it too answered jared with a clever grin i dontthink they realize how annoying their little quirks were until i started exhibiting them my dad was so annoyed with my commentary until my mum pointed out that i got it from him among other things i sure agreed harry you ll have to switch back to that accent you re using jared gave him a long look before he spoke are you going to keep my secret for the time being answer me one question about the future said harry and jared nodded now it something i just going to take a guess at but i was wondering where i fit in all of this what in the store for me you ll live answered jared with a smile you have to we ll need you later on to protect me why would you need protection asked harry let just say that some events will take place that will force my family into hiding you wontbe with us you ll be our secret keeper because you re my parents best friends and you re also my godfather jared gave harry a wider grin i become your secret keeper asked harry with alarm what happens i cantsay anymore than that let head back there are more important things we have to deal with right now aunt ginny taken over researching magnus identity right now but there no telling if she ll find anything you re right but if this man after ron or hermione wouldntbe easier to tell them asked harry you wouldnthave to say that you were their son just that you re from the future they wouldntknow enough to help us ron not trained yet to handle it hermione diary is already helping us they re not going to handle it very well i know those people i come from them hermione has a diary asked harry with genuine surprise i didntknow that let head back now suggested jared as he turned back i dontlike being here longer than necessary someone warned me about this place who asked harry jared smirked at him and replied you did a raven watched from above with its beady little eyes he saw the young couple to be walking together from the water source the red head was still growing his body was lanky and skinny compared to the muscle he would eventually build the brown haired girl walking next to him was blossoming into womanhood quite beautifully the raven had never really seen her up close before so where did harry go asked hermione as she pulled a lock of her hair behind her ear he and jared went to go gather the wood answered ron hermione gave him a worried look you mean you let harry go alone with him you re the one who kept saying that you didntthink that jared would hurt harry are you saying that you ve changed your mind asked ron hermione threw her hands up in the air never mind she muttered now what asked ron exasperatedly it just that you dontlike jared what do you have against him ron asked hermione why do you like him so much demanded ron if you like him so much then maybe you should be around here hermione felt frantic at that moment what gives you the right to be jealous she said in a harsh whisper and i asked you before why do you come after me the moment you think someone remotely interested in me ron face was red why would i be jealous you re right do whatever the hell you want he responded angrily what going on with you two asked jared as he and harry came up to them they had dropped off the wood already where neville asked harry he took one of the buckets back already replied hermione as she ran her fingers through her hair jared looked at his parents then at harry he didntsee the raven that was watching him the raven took off at that moment the black bird flew high into the air until it was up to the mountains they were the same mountains that sirius black used before as shelter when harry was in the triwizard tournament the raven changed into a man that did not match the picture that jared had sketched looks like his mudblood whelp has shown up what to do next he said to himself as he paced back and forth in order to stop the brat the only way to go is to kill the mudblood bitch yes that would be best but not before he realizes what he is about to lose i cantkill him i want to feel it i need him to feel it i wonder what happened whispered jared to harry as they watched the tension between ron and hermione is it something i did i think so answered harry in an equally soft whisper you ever think that you re the reason why ron going crazy do you know what it looks like when you spend so much time with his sister and hermione jared gave him a brief quizzical look before a dawning realization hit him sometimes he was just as oblivious to his actions as ron oh i didntknow he was mad at me for that but he doesnthave to be i mean she s well you know what she is to me that just sick they dontknow that retorted harry and i thought you were supposed to be really smart he doesntreally change much he doesntlike it when any man looks at her a certain way she kind of learning how to ignore it well they re going to be at each other throats if you continue to do what you re doing fine i ll stay out of the way just stuck with me for now jared gave harry an appreciative look you should have told me sooner went on harry i pretty sure that i would have sworn to protect you long before you ever came thanks harry but what about them i ll take care of it harry assured him just stay out of the way for now jared nodded and went into the tent as harry approached them are you ever going to finish bring those buckets he asked with a smile he was having a hard time not smiling at them it was exactly the same grin that ginny had been wearing earlier yeah we were just coming called ron as he carried two buckets he had taken the one from hermione despite her resistance are you all right mate fine replied harry why are you asking me that you went off with jared by yourself answered ron hermione was worried hermione cheeks were bright red as she exclaimed indignantly i was not nothing happened jared and i gathered the wood and brought it back we d all better get back and make sure everything ready tomorrow going to be a hard day professor de luca will be inspecting the work we ve done so we should get moving urged harry harry was absolutely right something was about to happen that would change the course of events already in motion the raven was already waiting for the next day which was going to be a very hard one for everyone especially ron and hermione an the raven references to hermione and jared are less than kind harry now knows but the next part going to be hard jared maybe in more trouble than he realizes we have yet to see what ginny yields in her research we are getting pretty close to one of jared parents figuring out who he is but not before he annoys them even more with the assistance of his favorite aunt and godfather disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twelve a stroll ron and hermione entered the maze without any hesitation but after a minute they realized how quiet it was she gave him a glance as they walked onward in silence it didnttake long for them to realize that they hadntseen anyone come in or run into the others inside ron where everyone asked hermione feeling the air around go cold with each second harry is right behind us there nothing to worry about ron hurriedly reassured her but he didntsound so sure of himself let keep moving we re bound to run into someone sooner or later hermione merely nodded and followed him closely they continued for another ten minutes in silence until they stopped again ron we haventseen anyone for a while now we arentin the maze anymore look around whispered hermione ron didntanswer her he knew where they were headed this isntpart of the maze at all how did we get here i have no idea replied ron but we re in the forbidden forest i ve been wondering how long before we d have to go in here what is that supposed to mean snapped hermione ron gave her a grin as he explained well almost every year one way or another one of us ends up going in here with harry one way or another it was you last year with the centaurs and hagrid brother we really didntgo in the year before that corrected hermione we did that our third year i went in with harry on the second we had to go looking for the spiders said ron as he glanced around nervously didntjared say that there were spiders in this thing i think he meant the maze ron i dontthink we re supposed to be here i not sure what if everyone went out in different directions ron even professor de luca with his eccentrics wouldntput any student through the forbidden forest every year professor dumbledore warns us so the faculty has to listen too ron heard something snapping like footsteps on twigs he stopped drew his wand and shield hermione with his arm stopping her from walking ahead of him she drew a long breath and looked around her she gripped his hand tightly when something came out of the darkness a hooded figure came at them harry neville and jared had walked in together with their wands drawn they immediately ran into seamus and dean who had stopped for a little bit after the former had tripped and hurt his knee are you guys all right asked jared as he came to their assistance do you want to turn back no we have to finish this insisted seamus as he grimace when jared pressed a piece of his outer robes to stop the bleeding you know hermione can do a better job at this than any of us i sure of it pointed out jared without looking at anyone in particular we didntsee them come in dean informed them jared stopped and looked up at him so he repeated ron and hermione never came in that impossible muttered harry they were right ahead of us we re supposed to be right behind them what about lavender and parvati they went up ahead of us we told them to at least we have a chance of they can figure their way through the maze answered seamus as jared secured a bandage harry looked around and finally his eyes settled on jared i sure they re all right are you all right jared neville spoke up we should keep moving professor de luca said that there were different ways to get through the maze we just have to find it maybe ron and hermione took a different way they might get through the maze before anyone else in gryffindor jared got to his feet and stepped forward without glancing at the others they followed him after one glance back we have to get moving the sooner we get through this the sooner we ll see everyone at the end ron had his wand ready for anything and hermione was right behind her they ducked their heads when they saw it was only a swarm of bats it daytime how can they be out observed hermione how can you bloody tell it daytime when the trees are so tall they cover the sky retorted ron rather annoyed ron we should go back in the opposite direction we came from we re obviously just getting deeper and deeper into the forest we have no idea where we are when we walked in we thought were walking into the maze just because we go back in the opposite direction doesntmean we go back to where we started if there anything more obvious than the fact that we re going deeper and deeper into the forest it the fact that it looks like we walked into a trap why would anyone want us to walk into a trap who would have the power to do that especially in front of professor de luca someone who wanted us to separate from the others and i thinking someone who knows more than he seems hermione immediately knew who ron was talking about you mean jared blake did this that insane ron is it he was the one who tested the damn obstacle course in the first place hermione he could have done something to it while he was in it argued ron why is it so hard for you to accept the fact that he not what he seems because you said so yourself he seems familiar somehow i canthelp but think that he not out to get anyone especially harry they re getting along right now are you telling me that you re jealous because harry and him started spending a lot of time together since yesterday no that not why answered ron after some hesitation okay maybe last year he was so mad at us i mean harry he wouldntconfide in us i mean we lied to him because dumbledore told us not to tell him anything that still a lie even before yesterday jared and harry get along it was right away and i was spending my time with him too added hermione why dontyou get to know jared too maybe if you didntyou wouldntfeel left out and another thing about harry last year he wasntthe easiest person for anyone to get along with i mean he was fighting more than just voldemort last year or any of his followers he was fighting wizarding society it easy for you ron you were born and raised into this world harry spent most of his childhood feeling unaccepted in the muggle world and then last year he experienced it in this one ron paused for a moment and took a long look at hermione is it hard for you hermione i mean going back and forth i feel more comfortable in the wizarding world i never understood why i felt so different until that letter but yeah it hard i cantreally explain to my parents and i canttell the rest of my family anything but this isntabout me right now we re talking about harry he got a temper worse than yours when he mad ron gave her a lopsided grin the same as the one that jared had given ginny earlier you forget something his mother had red hair are you implying that harry has a bad temper because his mother had red hair i mean that just a stereotype ron you just have a bad temper because you have a bad disposition insisted hermione with a laugh look it not just a stereotype look at harry getting black hair from his father was just a good way for him to cover up his temper said ron as he chuckled hermione started really laughing i cantbelieve you we re lost and you re making jokes but if what you say about red hair is true then one of jared parents has to have red hair because he got a bad temper too look what happened to malfoy she stopped laughing as she looked at ron side profile for a moment what is it asked ron nothing answered hermione she pulled the lock of her hair behind her ear as she changed the subject ron i worried what if we re really in trouble here do you honestly think i would let anything hurt you asked ron hermione shook her head as she replied i trust you jared strode ahead of the others neville and dean were supporting seamus and they were having the most difficulty keeping up harry was right behind jared saying slow down jared seamus hurt we need to get out of here we ve wasted enough time muttered jared under his breath he was very worried about his parents we re not going to hurt seamus more by forcing him to go faster argued harry he sighed as he glanced at the neville you re part of our team neville what do you want to do i think you should go up ahead answered neville i ll stay here and help dean and seamus i dontneed help said seamus as he winced we can handle this insisted dean neville shook his head i ll stay he said firmly as he glanced at harry and jared jared didntbother to turn around you d better get moving i dontknow where the rest of the class it but we dontwant the slytherin to win do we harry nodded in agreement as he glanced at jared again let go jared we ll see you at the finishing line we ll leave you a trail to follow all right see you later said neville giving them a grin as they walked away hermione studied the bottom of a tree she sighed as she looked at ron i dontknow what direction the moss is growing i never thought i d have to figure out what direction the castle was in we re not trying to go to the castle we re trying to go in the opposite direction muttered ron impatiently that why i trying to figure out what the direction the castle is in said hermione irritably what do you suggest we do do you have any idea where we are other than lost you donthave to bite my head off retorted ron like i told you before i wouldntlet anything happen to you i thought you trusted me hermione nodded as she ran her fingers through her hair i just frustrated she muttered everyone got to be through that maze by now a crow was lurking in the highest tree branches it black eyes focused on the pair as the continued to find their way through the forest the crow eyes fell upon hermione and it let out a loud caw of disapproval mudblood bitch ron glanced up at the crow something came over him a very bad feeling hermione felt ron clamp his hands over her shoulders what is it she asked in alarm ron hushed her she stared at him so intently with wide eyes that she didntnotice him lower his hand to flick his wrist to make sure he was armed with his wand it was just a crow ron put your wand away you re going to hurt someone whispered hermione harshly it turned out that ron had the good idea an orb of light came from the treetops just barely missing them ron pulled hermione behind him who there demanded ron as he brandished his wand towards the trees where the spell had come from expelliarmus he shouted but no wand came to him a crow cawed and dove for their heads hermione screamed in surprised as she drew her wand avis she shouted conjuring birds to deflect the attacking crow the birds surrounded and protected ron and hermione temporarily what is going on i dontknow but i dontthink this was part of professor de luca campout answered ron i think we should get moving before something else comes after us now do you believe when i said this was a trap yes agreed hermione without hesitation but i still dontthink that jared responsible for this ron stared at her for a moment marveling at her stubbornness he shook his head to stop himself from starting another argument especially another one about jared thus he said i think we should get out of here first before we decide who started this whole thing we should just go back to the castle i ve never been this far into the woods before said hermione neither have i admitted ron i hope we run into someone friendly to us or to the school me too agreed hermione what are we going to do if we cantget out of here ron gave a smile as he jokingly replied what so wrong with being just with me the look on his face was so reminiscent of jared that hermione blinked at him why are looking at me like that are you okay i fine it just that i ve been getting this weird feeling of d j vu lately answered hermione so do i said ron as he looked at her he was leaning in close towards her face he lowered his head closing in on her face their lips were mere inches away from each other suddenly ron pulled back away from hermione his ears were reddening he cleared his throat and ran his fingers through his hair as he turned his head away from her ron i think there something out here to get us said hermione as she looked around anxiously and you re worried that since harry isnthere we re in trouble supplied ron with a sigh every time you get into trouble he almost always the first person you call on hermione placed her hands on her hips as she said i dontalways rely on him ron it just that he has more experience with this kind of thing than we do ron shook his head he got more than i do hermione you re talking about money harry doesnthave what you have you have a family that loves you and how do you know that you wontmake something of yourself someday i think you ve got a great chance of becoming an auror is that what you want to be still i wouldntbe in snape class if i didntwant to be one you know what i ve never heard what you wanted to be to tell you the truth i really dontknow admitted hermione she laughed at the look on ron face yeah pretty hard to believe isntit i always the one with a goal or a plan but things changed for me both my parents are dentists so i thought that i would be one too but when i found out that i was a witch a whole different world of possibilities opened up for me i have a feeling that i may just end up falling into my career is there anything you ve got planned for the future getting married and having a family of my own what about you i dontknow if i ll have a family as big as mine i dontknow who would want to have me i really donthave much to offer not yet but any girl would be a fool not to notice your potential pointed out hermione confidently as she gazed at him and some of what you ve got isntjust potential i wouldntpay any attention to what that girl from ravenclaw said so ginny told you didntshe said ron sheepishly i guess it better that she told you than me no one had to tell me anything said hermione oh mouthed ron without actually saying anything they continued to walk on but they stopped when they saw the tops of a familiar sight ron smiled as he told hermione look it the quidditch field i d know that anywhere i fly there every week almost everyday thank goodness sighed hermione with relief yeah thank goodness agreed ron yet both of them didntexpress any of the feelings they had towards each other the entire time they didntgive any indication of the affections they had for one another that was the reason why their would be attacker decided to delay his attack what do you mean you didntsee them come through here fumed jared at professor de luca the dada professor regarded him calm as he continued are they only ones who didntget out of that maze that impossible i ll use the shortcuts that i put in the maze and search for them professor de luca assured jared as he drew out his wand everyone stay where you are if anyone moves from here you will have detention not even the slytherins could say anything because of the professor tone he walked up to the maze and uttered the spell to unlock the secret passages all at once it shouldnttake that long with the passages opened they shouldnthave much trouble getting out jared paced a little bit appearing so much more worried than anyone else harry cleared his throat and when jared didntacknowledge him he said stop that people are starting to look what so wrong blake drawled draco with his arms folded over his chest without looking at jared you re worried that weasley got his hands on granger if i didntthink that i would get into any trouble or that there was any hope for you i would make it so that you would see tomorrow retorted jared as he glared at him he would have said more but harry threw jared a look that stopped him come on jared urged harry as he veered him away from draco and the others they walked a little bit before he started whispering to jared what was that all about he my professor answered jared under his breath he almost relished seeing harry eyes widened before you guess potions he my transfiguration professor unbelievable breathed harry in utter surprise i thought he bought his grades headmistress mcgonagall appointed him after she became head of the school which wasnttoo long before dumbledore passed away revealed jared so malfoy was there before i started at the school i sorry my tense is all wrong everything is in past tense for me while i should be saying in future tense now for you it one of the annoying things about time travel harry couldnthelp but grin as he pointed out you sound like your mother pointing out grammar at a time like this is so much like her i dontthink anything happened to them you wouldntbe here still if something had that true agreed jared i have a vested interest in what happens to them after all if anything happens to them nothing is going to happen to them interrupted harry in a reassuring tone ron and hermione both gave sighs of relief when they saw the high turrets of the quidditch field neither thought of the strange goings on that they had encountered in the forbidden forest because they were too relieve to be out of it just once i would like it very much if neither you harry nor me end up there muttered hermione we re out now that all that matters said ron as he glanced around him we should get back to the camp site i dontwant to even think of what they re probably saying about us hermione glanced at him and started to grin at him what do you think they re going to say about us that you and i ran off together ron turned bright red at her comment as he sputtered n no that not it what you dontthink i have a chance asked hermione appearing quite harmless at the moment she was enjoying seeing him getting all flustered on her account he was cute when he got like that however she soon realized how uncomfortable he was so she said come on ron we ve been friends for years now i dontthink they re going to say anything about us they ll probably say we just got lost yeah that it responded ron he hadntanswered her question the truth was he didntwant to say that he didnthave a chance with her he didnthave the personality or the social skills he wasntas smart nor as rich as her it wasntall that hard for him to conclude that he didnthave a chance there you are said professor de luca immediately getting their attention i ve been looking for you how did you end up here it was hermione who answered for them we have no idea but we just got out of the end of the forbidden forest the professor looked a bit startled at hermione explanation he looked around him and felt a chill go through him he was definitely sensing something out there let head back to camp we ll take the long way you ve been through the forest enough to day they nodded it didnttake very long to get back to camp and on the way they talked about what had happened in the forest when they reached the camp the first person to greet them was jared are you all right what happen he asked anxiously hermione glanced at ron briefly wondering if he was going to confront jared neither of them told professor de luca that they thought jared had something to do with what happened to them in the forest however this time ron eyes locked with jared s he found himself startled by them they were alight with concern we got lost replied ron an this chapter features some of the best dialogue yet at least i think so this is the time where ron and hermione have a chance to compare notes on their little boy and there is another example of why harry and jared get along so well they have so much in common seeing jared grow up gives harry the chance to see what it would have been like for him to be raised by his parents disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter thirteen temporal flux theory the rest of the weekend was pretty uneventful harry had to spend that time as a buffer between jared and his parents of course he was starting to come to the conclusion that when two stubborn people reproduce the end result would be an extremely obstinate offspring harry wondered how he didntnotice before just how much jared resembled his parents and why he hadntmade the connection then jared sensed the tension between himself and ron and hermione he was sure they were suspicious of him so he kept his distance from them part of him was glad that they seemed closer together than they did before but another part of him didntlike the fact that they only bonded against him his own conclusion was the one that most children had in regards to their parents they re strange people there was also ginny to think of jared wondered how far along she had gotten in her investigation of magus did she get anywhere truth be told he had almost completely forgotten about her all together he told harry that ginny was looking for magus and harry agreed to help them out as soon as the weekend was over the best thing harry could do was keep ron and hermione distracted for jared which he was more than willing to oblige after all he was going to be jared godfather he was sure that ron and hermione would forgive him soon afterwards if they ever figure out what was really happening above all harry didntwant anything happening to them when the weekend was over jared and harry decided to meet with ginny together so that ron wouldntget suspicious of jared meeting with ginny alone they would have to compare notes because harry got almost the fully story of what happened in the forest from ron unfortunately there wasntmuch news you mean you couldntfind anything on him asked jared ginny nodded solemnly i tried but i just couldntfind anything on him i feel like we re running out of time or something and after what happened during the campout we know that he getting closer and closer they re obviously not safe on the school grounds agreed harry the best thing we can do is make sure that they dontget into a trap do you have any other clues i have my mum journal replied jared she kept one throughout her time in hogwarts during her first few months her she considered it the only friend she had until that hollow eve you fought that troll harry smiled ruefully ron called hermione a nightmare and said that was the reason why she didnthave any friends he said fondly he said that after he got partnered with her in charms when we were learning how to do levitation spell hermione was able to do it before everyone else in the class and she didntcome from a wizarding family i was able to do it first too said jared almost cheerfully a grin never made it to his face instead he looked almost sad we ll find out how he getting so close and we ll find a way to stop him before he does anything if we don t you wontbe born said ginny as she placed her hand on top of his i wontget to see how cute you ll be actually you can said jared as he pulled out his mother journal he must have slipped it in here it his favorite baby picture of me he normally has it on his desk in his office at the aurors jared opened the journal to where the picture was he handed it to ginny to look at he not even in it ginny smiled a little as she looked at the little baby with his mother ron took this picture didnthe jared nodded you look so cute and your mum looks like she positively glowing how old are you in this picture i think i a week old answered jared as ginny passed it to harry he looked at it for a while too that in front of the house that we live in my dad bought it before he and my mum got married he was currently speaking in his natural voice because it was easier on him and it gave him break from doing his american accent he said it was a wedding present ron gave hermione a house as a wedding present asked ginny with utter surprise i didntknow aurors made that much money actually when they start they don t you never got the feeling that the ministry pays its employees enough money i mean granddad had to make the money stretch among the lot of you there was seven of you after all pointed out jared i a rarity in the family for more than one reason well you re already so unique said ginny what do you mean asked harry with genuine curiosity i an only child and the only half blood in the family replied jared of course i have tons of cousins so it never very hard to find a playmate that is weird snorted ginny i would have thought at least more than one of us would have married out or mated out if that would be the case who do i end up with she leaned forward at jared who pulled back from her never mind i dont think i want to know yeah anyway i an only child because my mum couldnthave more than one she almost died having me my dad was dead set against having any kids if it meant my mum risking her life so he was so against it that he said he didntwant any kids at all mum wanted to have a baby of her own she wasnt happy watching everyone else and just being an aunt of course she wanted to have a baby with my dad so she had to gain his cooperation ginny laughed ron can be pretty stubborn if he wants to be how d hermione pull it off i not sure to tell you the truth but i believe that my dad was tricked into it replied jared with a shrug my dad was pissed off after he found out to put it mildly but he gave in before i was born i think my papa straightened him out papa echoed harry with a raised eyebrow oh my mum dad i call my maternal grandparents papa and nana i call my paternal grandparents granddad and grandmum revealed jared as he continued explaining papa and dad get along great especially after they decided to get along against my great grandmother they dontlike her but she does tend to be a bit overwhelming she doesntlike anyone who marries into the family no one good enough for her daughter or granddaughter muggles arentthat different from wizards after all does she know about the magic asked harry he sort of laughed does she like you nope they decided not to tell her papa said that she d probably blame him for her granddaughter being a witch she happens to adore me i her blood relative after all she calls me her little prince ginny shook her head if you ask me you re a little spoiled i mean look at you you re wearing much newer clothes than most of us weasleys my clothes are my mum doing she drags me off to go clothes shopping before school every year we wouldnthave to do it every bloody year if it wasntfor the damn growth spurts that i got from my dad did you know he still growing everyone keeps telling me that i going to be as big as him aw poor baby having to go clothes shopping teased ginny it embarrassing and the worst part is dad lets her drag me shopping exclaimed jared while harry spent that part of the conversation laughing he says i should be happy to have new clothes i just want to go shopping without her stop laughing harry i sorry let go back to the business at hand shall we asked harry jared was just as sensitive as ron when it came to teasing so harry decided to give his godson a break they were currently meeting in the room of requirements because it had everything that they needed jared got up and started looking around until he found something that he needed what is it i need a sugar quill answered jared as he smiled at the box he found i have a sweet tooth he opened it and took out a quill what are we going to do next we need to find magus before he tries again said ginny switching back to a serious mode we cantjust wait around for the next move to happen maybe we should tell your parents that way they could help us no absolutely not said jared firmly as he shook his head i dontthink it a good idea and they probably dontknow anymore than we do anyway how do you know that asked harry as he flipped through hermione diary he wasntreally reading it but he was paying attention to the dates to figure out which part to read how is this diary supposed to help us temporal flux theory harry stated jared in an almost bored tone it becomes one of the pioneering fields of study in the wizarding world the ideal that time is in a constant state of flux or movement if this happened before that means that i ve been back in the past because i from the future okay that makes sense said ginny sarcastically i think i understand you re already here and this is the past for you that means that any odd things would be somewhere in this journal said harry as he looked through it here something about you jared said i already read that i a little uncomfortable reading it it my mum journal after all i really dontwant to read this either agreed harry as he skimmed it i feel like i invading her privacy or something oh for the love of merlin give me that exclaimed ginny as she grabbed the book out of harry hands he was staring at his once occupied for moment as she started reading it i donthave any problem reading this thing i dontwant to read anything personal about my mum muttered jared defensively he shifted uncomfortably you dontwant to know your mum a woman said ginny knowingly you re just as bad as your dad it took ron four years to realize that hermione was a girl jared retorted she not a woman she my mother um isntthat one of the reasons why your father married her asked harry jokingly it not that he didnt notice she was a girl he just noticed when it was convenient i not even going to ask how long it took to sort it all out what we need now is a plan i ll keep reading this journal for right now and i ll keep it out of sight from other people said ginny halloween is coming up so we ll have some time during the celebrations to come up with something else another weekend at hogsmeade is coming up during that weekend maybe you can take a trip to london i could go with you offered harry i can travel back and forth between both the muggles and wizards there are some advantages to being half bloods agreed jared but i think they re going to notice that we re gone not if i have something to do with it said ginny confidently you two worry about how you re going to get through and find out how are you going to do it so what we have here is a half plan concluded jared i guess half a plan is better than no plan at all that optimistic of you observed harry okay now let get our stories straight for when we go back there ginny what are you going to tell your brother i was in the library studying for the o replied ginny and what were you two doing she asked this question as she put hermione journal into her notebook i ll be coming back from the pitch said harry he was dressed in his practice clothes and had his broomstick jared was out near the lake you do like to hang out there jared nodded who should get back there first um i think i should go back first and get their attention that way you can come in we ll keep them both distracted then jared can slip in unnoticed answered ginny i never you had such a sneaky streak ginny complemented harry i probably shouldntbe surprised you are a weasley after all which makes me wonder what happened to ron he the honest one said jared i not saying that i more weasley than he is but remember i ve inherited the ability to be a smart alec from my mum they do make a beautiful couple said ginny with a sigh as she wore a dreamy expression she shook it off immediately when she looked at jared who was giving her a blank look anyway let head back now the next few days were quieter as ginny read hermione journal most of the entries werentthat exciting at first but ginny carefully read them she was reading all the way back to the beginning of the school year they got interesting as ginny read along one of the entries was about hermione reaction to ron date with that ravenclaw that was what piqued ginny interest soon ginny found that she was reading the passages about hermione still developing feelings there was a lot of self denial going on and from ginny perspective it wasntjust going on with just hermione ginny didntknow that ron had gotten hermione a birthday present unlike harry ginny held no reservations of spying on her brother love life and she already knew that hermione was going to become her sister anyway the passages about the forbidden forest were almost exactly as harry had told jared and ginny but hermione and ron had left out what was happening between the two of them as hermione wrote i tired of ron putting himself down he does it all the time he always thinking about how having no money will keep him from getting anything i would like him to see him just as i see him this is so stupid he stupid i not that shallow and i not that much into having things there is only a few things i want but he cantsee that there no hope for him ginny wanted to laugh at that last part obviously hermione didntmean it if anyone out there had faith in ron it was her she was just frustrated with him the hardest part of the whole thing for ginny was keeping such a juicy secret she wanted to tell ron just to see his reaction to it but ron wasntgoing to find out if jared could help it he was avoiding ron but it wasntthat easy to do they were sleeping in the same dorm and they inevitable ran into each other regular it came to a head at the stairs the following evening i sorry said jared on his way down the stairs running to ron who was going up them yeah said ron they both shifted aside to let the other pass but they had shifted in the same direction do you mind getting out of my way ron voice sounded a bit angry at that point as far as he knew jared was monopolizing harry time i was coming down first pointed out jared no i was going up argued ron jared rolled his eyes as he normally did when his father said something infuriatingly stupid he responded stubbornly by putting his arms outwards blocking ron way almost entirely we re halfway on the stairs and i was going down them so i have the right of way you donthave the bloody right of way growled ron jared being well acquainted with ron temper looked unfazed let me through you let me through first muttered jared for the love of merlin exclaimed ginny as she stalked up to the bottom of the stairs this is stupid one of you should be nice and let the other through she looked at them at that moment they were remarkably similar she sighed as she said jared let ron up now jared glared at her because he felt like he was winning but he moved aside anyway ron went up the stairs stomping all the way i knew you were going to take his side said jared in a low voice as he went down the rest of the steps that was pointless jared said ginny you re as bad as he is why didntyou just let him through he should have let me through argued jared argh exclaimed ginny as she threw her hands in the air and walked back to her books you re impossible which one asked jared truly perplexed ginny shouted back both of you she continued to mutter under her breath it sounded something like just what i need two of you harry and hermione looked up from their books harry was snickering while hermione was shaking her head at the situation she was starting to get the feeling that she was being left out of a really good joke or something meanwhile ron was up in the dorm to get something he was also muttering under his breath about how much of a prick jared was he had to dig through his trunk for an extra quill because he had broken the tip off his jared spent most of his time up in the dorm studying away from everyone else he only came down every once in a while to stretch his legs ron noticed that jared had left some of his homework on his bed ron walked up to the bed not knowing why he was doing it exactly jared handwriting was neat and looked as easy to read as hermione s his spelling was excellent but there was something off about it ron knew that americans had a tendency to spell certain words differently from british english he noticed that jared had spelled the words in the british style and his grammar was the same way for someone born and raised in america ron thought that was a bit unusually or perhaps jared had adapted quickly to england the thing that jumped out at ron was the some of jared notes were the abbreviations they were identical to hermione s after years of borrowing her notes ron recognized them right away jared abbreviations were exactly the same and ron hadntseen him borrow anything from hermione not once ron shook his head at his paranoia he was looking into things too much ron grabbed his quill and went back down jared was sitting by the fire when he came back down ron went back to hermione and harry hermione did you lend any notes to jared ron asked in a low voice so that no one else could really hear him no he never asks replied hermione as she shook her head why nothing answered ron as he went back to his essay harry almost stole a glance at jared but kept his head to his work he had a feeling that ron was closer to figuring out who jared really was than anyone would have expected ron wasntsomeone that should be underestimated true his grades didnt reflect it all the time but ron was better at school that harry was harry always had other things on his mind though and harry was starting to think that ron was just playing dumb to get hermione help on things and to spend time with her it wasntuntil recently did harry notice that ron was constantly doing things to get hermione reaction and attention whether it was on purpose or not could be debated knowing about jared gave harry more insight on his best friends he wasntout of the loop by no means in fact he was always going to be in the loop he was going to be the first person that they were going announce their engagement to and he would be the first person to know about hermione pregnancy he would be the first person alerted for almost any family crisis they would have and he would be jared godfather all these things kept harry reassured and secure in his role as their best friend harry wasntgoing to be on the sidelines looking in he was going to always be a key player in their lives in fact he was closer to them than any brother could be they were his family and he was going to do everything in his power to protect them even if they were never going to hear about it some time later when everyone else had gone to bed there was another meeting okay did you decide how you were going to get out on halloween asked ginny i think i know how we re going to get out of here replied jared lucky for us halloween just falls before the hogsmeade weekend then you can leave hogsmeade from there but it going to be tricky to do it any possible information on magus would be in the ministry and that in london pointed out ginny or we could try something that wontget us expelled from hogwarts argued harry i not saying that i willing to take the risk but i thought you didntwant us to draw that much attention jared jared raised his eyebrow at him and asked then what do you suggest we know people on the outside replied harry people we can trust who remus lupin he might be willing to help us out jared shook his head moony cool but i dont know about telling him things moony asked ginny with a raised eyebrow i couldntsay remus when i was younger explained jared harry interrupted before the conversation could veer off into another topic again i think it would be safer for us and if we leave they might catch us for sure the only time that we can move around is when the holidays come up but that a long ways off and there something else that bothering me what asked ginny and jared in unison i think that ron getting more and more suspicious i think he might figure it answered harry ginny laughed and scoffed at the very idea please ron wouldntbe able to figure it out in a million years harry shrugged as jared didntsay anything however this would be one time that ginny would be totally wrong an most children have one parent that they have a harder time getting along with over the other in jared case ron is the parent that he doesntget along with so well because they are far too much alike this chapter is just a tension building one between ron and jared i think it sad that only one person thought that ron would be the one to find out next but the fun here is how and when he gets disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter fourteen weasley wizarding wheezes today there a huge feast that we have every year explained ginny on the weekend we re set to go to hogsmeade we normally get to go before this weekend but with all the trouble we can t because of you know who asked jared using the more commonly used moniker for voldemort after a stern explanation from ginny they were having their current conversation at the gryffindor table in the dining hall i ve never really seen hogsmeade as jared finished his sentence the owls began flying in with the mail hermione received her copy of the daily prophet as harry got the piece of mail of that he ginny and jared were waiting for he didnteven open it neither ron nor hermione asked about it because they were pouring over the newspaper ginny however had a note that made her exclaim in utter delight ron guess what what asked ron fred and george are going to be in hogsemeade this weekend they ll be doing a demonstration of some of their new products replied ginny with a huge grin jared perked up at the news of course he had all of the exclusive products from the weasleys wizarding wheezes it was one of the most successful businesses in the wizarding world and jared as a child was spoiled by his uncles who babysat him from time to time when he was younger the rest of the weasleys really overindulged jared because he was the child that everyone was expecting why are you so happy demanded ron as he stared straight at jared you dontknow fred and george and once you do may not like them as much they re legendary around here after the way they left said harry you haventheard about that yet have you no said jared of course he had it was a story he had heard many many times his grandmother was always trying to stop the story from being repeated in the hearing of the grandchildren why did they write asked ron why didntthey write me i dontknow but fred said you must be busy with your prefect duties because you didntwrite them answered ginny but they want to see us during the weekend ron ron snorted it wasntthat he wasnt happy with his brothers success but he had to deal with it the whole summer he got more than his fill of it they were helping out the family and they were partly the reason why ron had some new things for the school year even though their parents gave the reason of having less children to put through school would you like to meet them jared asked ginny knowing full well what the answer was going to be he nodded good i ll introduce you wait exclaimed ron you shouldnt be introducing him to anyone what is going on between you two his eyes darted a little bit at harry who just looked back at him i dontsee the harm ron said hermione as she folded up the newspaper if anything shouldntyou be more worried about jared than fred and george jared knew better than to just take anything that his uncles handed him after so many tears and screams and his father getting angry with them for attempting to traumatize him the twins always knew better than to antagonize jared it his funeral said ron as he shrugged jared had to admit that did make him a little nervous then it settled said ginny happily it not said hermione as she looked at ron professor dumbledore has asked the prefects have a meeting that day too we ll be able to go as soon as the meeting done ron ron sighed and asked why didntyou tell me sooner i just found out this morning and i wanted to put off the news as long as possible great harry said i guess i ll go ahead with you and jared ginny i ll meet you in hogsemeade that is if you dontmind ron was deciding what was worse letting jared go off with ginny alone to meet fred and george or forcing harry to wait for him and hermione ron decided that it was best to have harry go along with jared and ginny as a chaperone that fine i sure that the meeting shouldnttake that long but why did dumbledore wait until the weekend to have the meeting hermione it has something to do with what was in the paper this morning said hermione as she offered it up for everyone to see she had folded it to a story there were attacks on muggles in the surrounding areas why would anyone attack muggles like that asked ron as he skimmed the article hate crimes answered jared in a soft voice that what he wasnteven looking at the article he seemed to stare off into space for a moment must be the death eaters summarized ron as he glanced at hermione who seemed rather tense at the moment we re perfectly safe as long as we re in hogwarts and even hogsmeade is safe if it wasntdumbledore wouldntbe sending us out there this weekend he tempted to reassure her malfoy was walking towards class at that moment and choose to say something looks like all the mudbloods half bloods and muggle lovers better watch themselves he glanced at them weasel what are you going to do when they go after your friends huh you should really consider doing the smart thing the pureblood thing ron was on his feet before hermione could say anything or stop him jared saw the look on his face any anger that jared had immediately paled in comparison the first time that jared had ever seen that look on ron face was when he was just five years old it was the first time that jared had learned that he was different from other members of the weasley family he had learned the word mudblood for the first time when he was attending a very exclusive preschool for magically children the weasleys couldntafford it before but jared was sent there because ron and hermione could they wanted him to meet other magical children outside of the weasley family and to also learn about wizarding society he had proven to be the brightest child in his class but during playtime none of the other children would play with him mummy says you re a mudblood that means you re dirty your daddy a blood traitor daddy says that people like you shouldntexist it not right mudblood jared was unconsciously clutching his hands into fists he had thrown the worst tantrum that his mother had ever seen when she asked him how his first day was he kicked screamed and said he wouldntgo back he refused to tell her what was wrong it wasntuntil his father came home that jared asked him what a blood traitor was jared clutched his jaw as his whole body went rigid harry was sitting next to him and noticed how stiff jared was harry told to malfoy in a bored tone you know if purebloods were so superior you d be doing better than hermione in class almost right away harry had a reaction from malfoy potter people like you shouldnt really be talking much you may have the name of a pureblood but everyone knows that you ve got muggle blood in you retorted malfoy it been than being inbreed that your eyes are so close together quipped jared who bloody cares what someone like you thinks anyway he got to his feet rising to his full height he seemed more impressive at the moment i can break your arms off this time malfoy it wouldntbe that hard they ll just pop right off come on crabbe goyle said malfoy as he stalked off his eyes did flicker for a moment it wasntlike before when he could make the threat that he d tell his father things were slowly going to change for malfoy it was going to take ten years to do it jared sat back down this was the first time since the incident in the hall did he mention anything about twisiting malfoy wrist hermione sucked in a breath through her teeth which made jared feel some guilt she always did that when she was disappointed in him so he cast his eyes downward his cheeks felt hot that some temper you ve got there pointed out ginny as she gave jared a meaningful look i have my father temper he admitted without looking at anyone else i ve been dealing with people like malfoy for years look i going to the library today i ve got to catch up on some work i ll talk to you later ron was the first one to break the silence when he left he got some issues doesnthe ginny rolled her eyes at him and said imagine being a small kid and having other kids tell you that you dontdeserve to exist because your father a blood traitor that horrible exclaimed hermione horrified no wonder he so sensitive about it his father comes from one of the best known pureblood families around said harry his father isntjust any law enforcement officer he an auror so jared made of pretty stuff his mother a healer like he said before but she just started working again when he started at magical school his dad an auror repeated ron as his eyes lit up a bit he was really considering being one but he didntreally know anyone whose father was one he had talked a lot to kingsley and tonks over the summer about the training however in two years time he didntknow that he would have to choose between being an auror or a quidditch player ultimately ron choose to be an auror because two years in snape advance n e w t classes would have been wasted but that wasnthis real reason he found out that he would have to travel extensively and by that time he was pretty much in love with hermione although there were days that hermione would have preferred ron as a quidditch player than as an auror between the two auror was the more dangerous occupation yeah ron confirmed ginny and from what he said a good one too she gave brother a slight smile i wonder why he didntjust come right out and say it said hermione dontyou think that rather strange maybe he just didntwant to said harry hermione wasntletting it drop as she said you know it interesting because he so much of a free spirit most of them but he must have grown up with some strict parents or maybe not argued ron he cantbe that disciplined if he goes off from time to time i ve never seen anyone with that kind of temper before ginny almost snickered but managed to stop herself harry shook his head it seemed that hermione still not knowing jared true identity agreed with them as she quipped you are one to talk your temperament isntexactly what i would always call pleasant ron gave her a confused look i have no idea what you re talking about hermione i happen to have a very pleasant disposition hermione rolled her eyes at him and got to her feet enough let go and do some of our prefect duties i tired of you not doing your share of the work i not always going to cover for you aw come on hermione isntit bad enough we have to go out at night and have meetings with malfoy whined ron as he followed after her you know it no wonder why jared is so weird muttered ginny as she glanced at harry he so much like ron it scary harry nodded yeah i ve noticed i ll go and check up on him and make sure he fine i ll talk to you later by the weekend everything had settled down the feast was planned for the evening and jared went off with harry and ginny after breakfast to go meet with fred and george neither of the twins knew that they were about to meet their future nephew in fact ginny didntsay that harry and jared were coming fred george said ginny as she walked into the already busy shop the twins decided to open the new shop on hollow eve and they were banking on making a tidy profit in hogsmeade it hadntbeen decided yet which twin would be in charge of the store and ginny had a feeling that they were going to flip a coin to figure it out ginny greeted fred exuberantly are you here to buy something cause you know we could use the business he was mildly gesturing at the amount of people in the store otherwise you could help out your big brothers by waiting on customers i am not here to work for you i did that during the summer said ginny with little humor anyway i brought harry and jared here george greeted them first hey harry i george weasley and this is my brother fred so you re jared jared blake responded jared with a slightly smile nice shop you ve got here what do you have an american observed fred this is the first time we ve ever had a foreigner in this shop ginny rolled her eyes you ve only been open for two hours for crying out loud and you leave him alone she sounded very defensive which the twins caught on to quickly the twins eyed jared with deep interest as he looked around the store it wasnthis first time in the store when he was younger he used to go to the one in diagon alley often when he was going to hogwarts he went to the one he was currently standing in the layout of the store wasntmuch different than what he remembered some things werentin the same place and there were products that he didntremember so what are you looking for asked fred as he followed jared george told harry you re free to get whatever you want harry neither ginny nor jared knew that harry was the silent partner of weasleys wizarding wheezes harry made hermione and ron promise not to say anything to anyone and that promise still held even in the future i ll let you know if i need anything harry said to george as he browsed fred was right behind jared who turned suddenly and almost fell back in the process you break it you buy it said fred with a smile i ll remember that muttered jared with a smirk there were times that he hated being so tall he was still growing and at times he was clumsy and tripping over his feet when he was little he would just fall and be horribly embarrassed his father would reassure him it was because he was going to be a big boy and that the same thing used to happen to him too however jared had yet to see ron really clumsy which led jared to believe that he was really clumsy i can look around here by myself if you dontmind fred studied him for a moment before he concluded there something familiar about you i dont know why but i cantseem to place you yeah i get that said jared as he looked above fred head to ginny his eyes were pleading for a rescue ginny wasntcoming stop looking at me like that he told fred with some annoyance his cheeks were red along with his ears this didnthelp him yes you definitely look like someone i know insisted fred as he walked around jared but where i dontknow fred sort of got his answer when hermione and ron walked right in they were doing what they did best arguing all i saying ron is that i want you to take more responsibility you re suppose to what wrong with you i dontsee the point hermione countered ron loudly you re there to take care of it anyway hermione fumed as she went toe to toe with him with her hands on her hips i tired of taking up all the slack you ve got to do some of it too ron you re always making a big deal out of everything retorted ron fred and george went up to them and said in unison you re driving customers away ron and hermione faced them and pointedly ignore them as they turned to each other and continued with the squabbling i just want you to do more that all like what like some of the things that professor dumbledore said during the meeting just for once could you just do the schedule for our rounds i always the one who gets stuck with that jared had heard arguments similar to the one that they were having as a baby he had slept through most of it and everyone was amazed at that of course he could be just as loud if he wanted to after all he had inherited a good set of lungs judging by the sound of them arguing in the store will you two just stop pleaded george as he looked around at all the people who were starting to stare you sound like an old married couple jared snickered as he made his way to harry he and ginny were trying to hold back their laughter as jared got to them did you find anything you like asked harry to him quietly i ll just say i getting it or me offered ginny i sure you re used to not paying for this stuff i am but i dontneed anything right now said jared usually my mother tries to keep me out of the stores she always says that they re a bad influence on me she not wrong muttered ginny as the twins and jared parents continued to talk why dontwe wait at the three broomsticks yeah agreed jared hey we ll be waiting at the three broomsticks see all of you there said harry as they walked out that stopped them from talking pretty fast when harry ginny and jared were out the door fred said once again isntthere something familiar about him an jared is the weasley golden child by this time molly has it set that she wants ron and hermione together too and so everyone pretty much waits for jared to come along jared does have his own issues his parents are a tough act to follow and he not even a prefect in the future he doesntrealize how cool he is nor does he realize that he has a lot of stuff going for disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter fifteen hollow eve jared and ginny waited as harry brought them some butterbeer they settled themselves comfortably in their seats and watched as some of the professors from the school walked in jared didntseem to mind at all as they continued to wait for the twins ron and hermione you hardly ever seem to be bothered by the arguing commented ginny nah i used to it said jared i slept through most of them when i was a baby i guess you would have to be immune to it said harry as he looked at the door i think they re starting to get suspicious i guess it a good think that you donthave the same coloring at him ginny said if he did he d be the spitting image of his father i mean he d look exactly like him he already sounds like him when he drops the accent thanks for talking about me like i not here said jared with a smirk did i mention you re my favorite aunt really but i think i like my other aunts better right now you re so lucky that i not a violent person ginny tone was threatening as she formed one of her hands into a fist harry interrupted in a quiet voice stop they re here ron and hermione walked up to the table i ll go and get some butterbeer be right back said jared immediately as he got to his feet before they could even sit down let alone say a word ron and hermione glanced at each other before taking their seats well he eager observed ron will you two stop snipping at each other requested ginny before taking a sip of her butterbeer i tired of hearing you two fight all the time if your brother would be more responsible we wouldnthave this problem said hermione ron countered if hermione could relax more she wouldntget so upset over the smallest thing harry was starting to wonder how they were able to raise a child like jared together he seemed perfectly normal then again as harry had said earlier perhaps jared was immune to it because he was their offspring jared came back and set the bottles down in front of them before taking his seat thanks you should ve waited for fred and george they ll be along soon enough said hermione and we could have gotten our drinks ourselves yeah thanks besides we could have paid for the drinks ourselves added ron he was starting to notice that jared did have a lot of money with him not that he had seen it himself but he had seen all the new things that jared had with the exception of his trunk it appeared that jared parents made a lot of money it okay said jared with a casual shrug that bothered ron immensely as he said it must be nice to have money to throw around so easily jared gave him a startled look unlike his father he never had to wear hand me downs and have to worry about money he never wondered why his father indulged him with toys jared was an only child and a tad spoiled by his father and that irritated his mother from time to time unlike harry who also had money jared had both his parents alive and well my dad gives me an allowance jared explained feeling somewhat embarrassed you give me my allowance he thought as he stared into ron eyes ron stop picking on him said hermione you can just pay him back for the butterbeer if it bothers you that much ron didntsay anything but dug into his pocket and placed the coins in front of jared not knowing what to do exactly jared just picked them up the money and put it in his pocket he was thinking that the whole thing was utterly ridiculous and that ron had ended up giving him more money jared shook his head as he heard ginny snicker what are you laughing about demanded ron ginny shook her head nothing nothing at all she knew where jared had gotten his money from in the first place i just think that i d take advantage of getting a free drink every once in a while say harry would you like me and jared to pay you back since you got our drinks harry grinned and shook his head it fine see ron i think you just didntwant the butterbeer because it was jared who paid for it said ginny as she smiled at her older brother what do i have to do get you to be quiet asked ron ginny gave a mock look of shock as she said me all you have to do is ask then shut up hermione shook her head and rolled her eyes jared is it true that your dad an auror she asked changing the subject yeah responded jared slowly wondering how they found out he an auror he been one for about twenty years must be exciting ron wants to be an auror said hermione ron snapped at her why are you telling him that jared blinked ron normally avoided looking straight into his eyes because they bothered him with their startling familiarity however he had accidentally looked into those bewildered brown eyes he was startled as he turned his head immediate and his eyes settled on hermione s what wrong ron asked hermione her eyes were filled with concern brown eyes are common arent they asked ron out loud hermione nodded yes they are they re the most common color the rarest color happens to be either blue or green i dontknow exactly which one though why nothing muttered ron lucky for him he was saved because fred and george finally came into the three broomsticks oi over here he called the twins nodded as one of them came up to them while the other went to go get their drinks fred should be here in a minute said george as he pulled up a chair so what are you talking about nothing much said ginny although ron gone weird he asking if brown eyes are common it maybe common but they re not all the same pointed out harry i mean for example the eye shapes can be different he almost pointed out how hermione eye shape was different from the ginny and the twins jared had hermione eyes exactly much like how harry had his mother eyes as well harry was starting to notice that ron was getting more perceptive here you go said fred as he handed his twin one of the bottles you should have waited for us we wanted to treat you guys ron said you ve been doing that all summer hermione glanced at her watch and interrupted it oops i forgot i was supposed to send a letter to my parents they were planning something for the holidays isntchristmas a bit further off hermione asked ginny hermione shook her head it some big deal with my grandmother on my mother side it can never be too early for her she planning some sort of big ball or something i dontknow i really dontwant to go but i promised my mum that i would tell her my measurements so that she could pick out something for me while i away i guess i ll have to go to the dress shop here to make sure i ll meet you back at the castle for the feast i dontwant to be late just in case they re closing up early for tonight she said this all in a very big hurry as she put on her cloak and put her cloak on i really sorry the rest of you can enjoy your afternoon there been so much to do today as soon as she was gone ron said does she look more anxious about it jared couldnthelp it but mutter under his breath you dontknow her dontknow who asked ginny hearing him perfectly jared cleared his throat i mean hermione grandmother not that i know maybe she one of those types that mean well but really dontunderstand at all you know i just remembered that i have to get some more quills i ll see you later he was having a difficult time with the way the other weasleys were staring at him are you sure you want to go alone asked harry trying to be helpful because i could with you i ll be fine jared assured him with a smile ron looked a little put off by it i think he can take care of himself harry after all his father an auror jared paused for a moment before saying of course i can handle myself when he was gone ron had his arms folded over his chest now he knew for sure that something was going on it had something to do with the concern that harry and ginny had for jared they were being too friendly but at the same time overly protective of him what happened was the last straw ginny glanced at harry as her brother glowered at her the twins were looking back and forth between them why are looking at us like that ron asked ginny ron raised an eyebrow at them and asked what the hell is going on when did you two become such good friends with jared i dont understand what going on one day you re telling me he could be a threat harry the next day you re out defending him and offering to go shopping for quills with him and ginny i dontknow what going on but you ve been looking very smug about it ginny sucked in air through her teeth it was a good thing that it was very noisy inside the three broomsticks no one was paying attention to what they were saying in particular i canttake it anymore she exclaimed out loud but we canttalk about it here ginny started harry fred interrupted now this sounds intriguing why dontwe go to the backroom of the shop and discuss it yes agreed george we donthave to go anywhere because ginny not going to say anything you promised jared you wouldn t said harry through his teeth ginny shook her head harry he didntexactly say that he wanted me to promise him not to say anything then let go announced ron angrily we re going harry you can come with us or run off and warn jared if you re so concerned i you re best friend what he to you he was on his feet and leaned forward his shadow casting over harry either way i going to figure out what going on we re kind of interested in knowing ourselves said fred and ron does look like he fit to kill right now we re just lucky that george and i are innocent bystanders harry was the one to scoff you maybe bystanders but you re anything but innocent ginny said harry let face it we re in trouble either way i mean ron mad now jared will get mad later either way think about it she was point out the temperaments of the two as being identical good point said harry i still think this is a bad idea he looked at ron when he said this come on harry this is too good a secret to keep exclaimed ginny anxiously i dontwanna keep it anymore i want to see how ron reacts she had her hands clasped in front of her i dontreally like where this is going said ron george pulled on ron arm to get him up as he got to his feet fred did the same to harry who was harder to get up because he was stubbornly clinging to the chair ginny got up under her own and lead the way out of the three broomsticks they trudged back to the store with one of the twins on either side of harry if he wanted to leave there was a little they could do he craned his head around to look for jared but he was no where to be found damn he muttered under his breath when they got into the backroom of the store after shooing one of the employees away fred locked the door and they all turned their attention on ginny she looked at each of her brothers and settled on ron who was looking at her intently there isntany easy way to say this i didntbelieve it myself what is it ginny demanded ron impatiently he turned to harry what the hell is going on harry jared your son erupted ginny it was so quiet one could hear a quill drop ron stood in stunned shock while fred and george had identical looks of wide eyes and wide mouths harry looked at them with a raised eyebrow wondering why they werentsaying anything the silence was broken by the sound of ginny relieved sigh oh i feel so much better now that i said it she announced happily ginny you ve got some power said harry as he waved his hand in front of them you stunned really well without a wand that not funny exclaimed ron making harry jolt back ron was seething as he was making wild gestures with his arms come on ginny who is jared really this has got to be the worst joke i ve ever seen he cantbe my son he as old as me for crying out loud harry his head whipped around to his best friend his real name is jared ronald weasley confirmed harry he came from the future with a really good spell ron was still shaking his head he not my son that impossible george quipped well he does look like you now that i think of it that why he seemed so familiar actually fred added he got brown hair and eyes though not as much freckles the brown eyes look familiar where have i seen those before they re obviously from his mum the twins looked at each other as they concluded hermione granger is mum if ron wasnthaving a heart attack then he was now he was shaking his head and blushing furiously now that is impossible he sputtered ron calm down said harry as he placed his hands on ron shoulders and shook him gently we re not lying he your son in case you haventnoticed he been using the american accent because his voice is identical to yours take a deep breath and think about it you know we re not lying to you ron stopped shaking his head but retain a color that resembled a tomato fred broke the silence with one quip at least we know that you dont die a virgin ron jared was picking through the quills and testing them out he was only happy when he found one that refilled it with ink he paid for his quill along with more rolls of parchment when he got outside he ran into hermione oh there you are he muttered as a way of greeting hermione looked up at him and smiled he always thought that she was pretty and when he was younger he would do anything it took to make her smile and he could do it so easily too are you on your way back to the castle i separated from the others cause i needed some new supplies i go through a lot of parchment ink and quills he told her i can see why jared said hermione yes i on my way back to the castle are you i just need to drop by honeydukes to refill my other supplies then i heading back he replied hermione shook her head and said you know too much sweets cantbe good for you especially your teeth jared knew that she was going to say something like that come on we re wizards and witches they have spells to prevent tooth decay even you took advantage of wizarding dental care despite your parents being dentists hermione hermione blinked in surprise yes she had her teeth shrunk down by madame pomfrey after a stray spell made them even larger than they normally were she didntremember telling him about it how did you know that she asked cautiously for a moment a look came over him that looked almost like a look that ron would have when he was caught doing something but jared covered up nicely ginny told me oh said hermione do mind if i come along to honeydukes with you no you always make good company hermione said jared besides i wanted to talk to you about what happened at the three broomsticks with ron hermione shook her head oh that you shouldntpay attention to much to that ron just a little upset whenever he reminded that his family doesnthave a lot of money it did change a lot last year after the twins business starting booming she explained as they walked along he just feels like he gets overshadowed by his older brothers there are five of them above him after all so he finds it hard sometimes to distinguish himself and having harry as a best friend also doesnthelp his self confidence jared didntknow what to say to that so he kept quiet they finished going through honeydukes quickly and returned to the castle soon after that jared put his things in his trunk while hermione had little choice but to get some work done hermione was plenty annoyed at ron for choosing quidditch over his prefect duties they spent more time arguing than getting work done leaving hermione very stressed out most of her fellow gryffindors steered clear of her whenever she was doing prefect business in the common room it took another good hour before ron ginny and harry returned they had spent most of the time calming ron down he wasntgetting over the shock but it was a good thing because he was forgetting to stay mad at harry and ginny for keeping it a secret in the first place i cantbelieve muttered ron again what am i supposed to do when i get there how am i supposed to face him now harry shrugged and said to ginny well you re the one who had to tell him so why dontyou help him out jared going to be mad at us too you know he got your temper ron dontremind me said ginny before her brother could say anything but you ve improved from earlier you ll be fine tonight the night of the feast so we donthave to worry too much about it until tomorrow yeah agreed harry we ll settle in for the feast and then everything will be settled later i also sure that hermione back at the castle by now she was in a bit of rush how am i supposed to face her exclaimed ron suddenly i mean this is all too much calm down ron urged harry dontmake me splash you with water again you know i always wondered what happens when two neurotic people get together and reproduce now the answer is simple you get jared teased ginny harry turned his attention to ginny and snapped you re not helping ron listen to me just act natural for merlin sake dontact any different ron responded i just wondering why she d marry me in the first place i ve got nothing to offer ginny rolled her eyes and was about to say something if harry hadntheld up his hand to silence her i know that you ve had a crush on her for some time now said harry ron shook his head quickly no yes you do you re just too dense right now to know any better i think you ve liked her since our first year you mean that he was too stupid to realize it put in ginny thank goodness jared got his mother brains he d be in a lot of trouble otherwise although i suspect you ve got a brain underneath that skull of yours somewhere ginny be quiet you re not helping harry ordered her you can keep all your smart comments to yourself i canthelp it shut it i did start to notice that jared was a lot like her admitted ron then i noticed that he had the same trunk as me i didntwant to say anything because i thought i d look mad or something he really my son in the future i have a son harry breathed a sigh of relief finally you re getting it let get there faster i dontwant to miss the start of the feast hey wait up exclaimed ginny as she hurried to catch up because harry had picked up his pace ron followed them reluctantly he wished he could deny what harry said about him having a crush on hermione harry was wrong it wasnta crush he didntknow when but he had fallen in love with hermione some time ago and now this jared presence didntreassure him it just made him more nervous when they got to the common room hermione was writing quickly and was in deep concentration ron followed behind harry and ginny the latter took a seat in two of the comfy chairs while the former made his way over to hermione he cleared his throat to get hermione attention when she didntlook up he said do you want some help hermione looked up a bit startled no i can take care of it ron she replied no i want to help just give me half of it he insisted her eyes searched his for sincerity while he was hoping that he wasntblushing or anything he was sure his ears were on fire she smiled a little as she gave him part of the stack are you sure she asked again yea i sure he replied i sorry about leaving all the work to you i ll try to help out more hermione tucked a lock of her hair behind her ear thanks ron there might be hope for you yet she said as she turned her attention back to her work ron settled down next to her and took one of the quills on the table at first he went straight to work to avoid looking at her a little later he found himself looking at her from time to time he could see it now he could see some of jared qualities as her brown eyes looked over the parchments if he didntbelieve before he believed now she was the most beautiful perfect person he had ever seen harry said jared as he came down interrupting ron thought he turned to see automatically i could use some help would you help me please it startled ron he stared at jared with his mouth agape jared noticed and turned his attention to ron are you all right ron he asked simply hermione looked up from her work what wrong what did i do now jared raised his eyebrow ron recognized it as one of his own gestures it was almost like starting into a mirror but different it was starting straight into his future i fine everything fine an somehow you ve got to figure that ginny cantkeep the secret for that long it too good to keep this is by far the funniest chapter i ve written in a while now ron knows he was starting to figure it out but he thought he was crazy if he said anything i love ginny in this chapter while harry remains as the calm one hermione still in the dark i have no idea when she going to find out as for background jared isntthe oldest weasley grandchild but he the one that people expected because it was clear to his grandparents that his parents would eventually get together jared is actually the sixth grandchild out of the weasleys just like ron is the sixth son and the only grandchild for the grangers the whole family did know that hermione would have problems with her pregnancy because ron was very vocal about not wanting to risk hermione life to have jared of course ron found out about hermione pregnancy after she told harry who was there to help soften the blow ron was a little freaked with over concern about hermione during the pregnancy and with impending fatherhood staring him in the face perhaps i should write about it also since the next book has been announced for release on july 16 2005 i ll have to speed up to get my next fic out in time before the next book or website information does something to my plot this means that temporal flux might be coming out faster i ll have to buckle down and keep messing around disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter sixteen hollow eve continued the feast was as wonderful as it was every year since almost everyone thought that it was jared first halloween in hogwarts they were trying to asking him how they did things in america it was good thing that his mother always bought him lots of books about different cultures i hear that the children go out in costume said seamus to jared jared nodded only the muggles do that though the covens are careful to keep their practices under wraps it not like here where there a large governing body that regulates things so you re a member of a coven asked dean jared answered the covens can be very large depending on where you re from the larger covens are in the older cities but that can be different it depends on the history of the area l a has lots of different covens because of the different cultures in the area america the world melting pot after all believe or not l a may be the shortest acronym but it the city with the longest name in the u s what the full name of the city asked lavender el pueblo del la reina de los angeles replied jared it means something like the town of the our lady of the angels the spaniards named it when they claimed it the nickname merely says the angels parvati said with somewhat dreamy eyes then you must be an angel yourself jared kind of choked back ron wasntsaying much because he was marveling at what a fantastic liar his child was while hermione was talking to ginny about something else harry kicked ron shin under the table ow what you do that for demanded ron as he ducked under the table for a bit to rub his shin now ron didntexactly ask why jared was there at this point he was getting over the shock that he was going to exist in the first place if ron knew why jared was really there he would be more alarmed what are you staring off into space for asked harry jared was sitting next to harry and looking at ron with some concern just like hermione would if she wasntdistracted at the moment with ginny jared shift uncomfortably as he picked up some more food for his plate but he couldnt quiet reach the pumpkin pasties ron pushed it to him and saw that his hands were just like his for that brief moment that their hands were on the plate thanks ron said jared politely for jared that was the first really kind gesture that he had seen ron do to him you re welcome muttered ron as he looked away are you all right tonight ron asked hermione teasingly you must be under some kind of spell or something ron gave her a confused look i mean you ve all of a sudden gotten more helpful and polite in one night what made you change so drastically and where did you put the ron that i know normally ron would have said something snappy to her but he didn t you know ron you ve been kind of quiet tonight observed neville is there something wrong nothing wrong sputtered ron quickly nothing wrong his whole face felt like it was on fire he was almost ready to blame jared for the whole thing for making him feel uncomfortable but ron quickly reminded himself that he was supposed to act like everything was fine ron you look very red commented hermione with concern are you sure you re not sick or anything ron stammered because she noticed what she was hoping she wouldn t i i f fine to make matters worse she pressed her fingertips against his forehead he pulled back as if her fingertips were on fire just leave me alone hermione he exclaimed defensively hermione was startled by his reaction and withdrew from him instantly sorry i just worried what the hell is wrong with you asked jared angrily ron was about to get angry at him but taking one look at his face made him feel bad it was hermione who came to his defense it all right jared it okay she said softly ron felt the guilt crawl up his neck at her tone she still stood up for him even after he had gotten mad at her sorry he muttered under his breath this didntseem to appease jared at all but he wasntlooking at ron anymore rather he was looking at ginny who looked at him briefly before looking away jared gave harry a sidelong glance and figured out what was going on his mother didntrise a fool after all sometime later jared waited in the common room for everyone to go to sleep he knew that ginny and harry were coming down to explain what was happening the longer he waited the anger he got when he heard them come down he started talking before he saw them okay what happened he demanded with his arms crossed over his chest what wrong with ron what did you tell him his eyes were directed at ginny who kept looking away from him i told him she admitted you couldntkeep your bloody trap shut could you as jared said this losing his fake accent altogether you ve really got ron temper observed harry jared glared at him i tried to stop her but she wanted to say something i said it was a bad idea but ron was starting to figure it out anyway i ll have you know if there one thing i ve inherited from my father it my temper shouted jared among other things said a quieter calmer voice from the stairs that led to the boys dorm it was now jared turn to be stunned into silence as he looked at ron who was coming down slowly so when were you going to properly introduce yourself not if i could have avoided it muttered jared as he glared at ginny who was concentrating on the ceiling now now let try to get along now after all you re family said harry and we shouldnt be so loud hermione might come down or something are you going to keep this from your mum asked ginny to jared jared sighed and buried his face in his hands he mumbled something but no one could hear him ron stepped forward and leaned in more he gently tapped his finger against jared hands why are you even here he asked that what i want to know and if you re really my son i would like to see some proof oh come on ron exclaimed ginny look at him the nose the ears the lips the hands look at how he built too and all unwelcomed sarcastic commentary he got a mischievous streak a mile wide if that doesntscream weasley then i dontknow what does how many other people know asked jared harry answered just fred and george we made them promise not to tell anyone great uncle fred and uncle george muttered jared as he raised his hands to the air and no i not telling my mum about me look at him he a mess he gestured at ron how did you come from me asked ron jared put his hands on his hips which was like his mother and replied we had this talk when i was fourteen i really dontwant to relive it it was uncomfortable enough for both of us the first time we had it ginny giggled at this harry didntsay anything as jared went on i guess i should probably tell you about why i here getting you up to speed might help us and by us i mean us as a family well being the only non weasley here i feel a little odd said harry finally they looked at him and he shrug i thought it was my turn to say something no you stay said jared you re my godfather why dontwe all get comfortable this is going to take a while to ron that was one of the few things that made sense they all settled in the chairs and jared began his long complicated story when he was done it took ron a little bit longer to process it so someone out there wants to kill me he said slowly did harry tell you what happened in the forest yes said jared with a nod magus is psychopath his crimes are hate crimes he kills muggles as well as those who support them it took years for you to track him and eventually bring him down azkaban isntthe same place it used to be the dementors arentthere any longer in fact i ve never even seen one that should make you feel better harry said ron because none of this is making me feel any better i ve read as much of the journal announced ginny there isntmuch going on other than what happened in the forest hermione doesntknow what going on she pointing out that you two have so much in common and should get along better she gave pointed looks at her brother and nephew whatever muttered jared if anyone had a problem it was him i didntdo anything he paranoid ron who was still in a bit of shocking about jared didntglare at him like he normally would have of course the mystery of where jared had learned the ability to be so obnoxious was now obvious so for the time being ron let it slide i didntknow she kept one he said yes she does said ginny she waved her hand towards harry and jared these two were too squeamish to read it i ve been reading it you probably shouldntread it ron no i want to see that said ron loudly as he got to his feet to get to his sister i want to see what she wrote about me ginny shook her head isntobvious that she didntwrite anything bad about you ron let it go she had the book closed in her hands and she was using it as a shield which was a bad idea because ron knocked it of her hands the book landed on the pages but the picture came out face up ron picked it up and gazed at it just when he didntthink hermione could look prettier she managed to do it in the picture the little baby in her arms was dozing as she waved his little fist in the air ahem jared interrupted his thoughts that would be me i know that said ron you look almost cute hey i was a cute baby exclaimed jared defensively ron went up to him and put the picture side by side with jared face he looked at the baby in the picture and at jared he did it twice if i look bad it really your fault muttered jared you have your mother eyes concluded ron i took this picture didnti rather i ll be taking this picture you ll keep it on your desk at the aurors office confirmed jared it your favorite family picture it was taken my first day out of st mungo and that our front door i ve lived in london most of my life so i a success asked ron disbelieving again he never would have thought he would amount to anything but looking at his young family for the first time it seemed that it was true he suddenly occurred to him that he wouldnthave even thought he had a chance with hermione unless he made something of himself first yes said jared with a nod it kind of hard to follow after you as your son everyone expecting something great from me it hasnthappened yet you were a prefect your fifth and sixth year next year you ll be head boy you ll also get offers to become a professional quidditch player as well as the chance to be an auror so will you uncle harry one the last parts for you uncle harry it no contest you re already tired of all the attention so you turn down the offers immediately but for you dad it different you want to make some of yourself but when you find out about the traveling schedule you decided not to take them up on their offer you go on to be an auror instead which was probably the better decision although it more dangerous than playing quidditch which really worries mum a lot jared hadntnotice that he had completely lapsed on what he was calling them earlier in fact this was the first time that ron had heard himself referred to as dad ginny broke the silence see you go on to be like bill and percy after all ron it not completely unique but you divert and go on to be something you really wanted to be i cantbelieve it i dontreally want to be like percy muttered ron what happens to everyone else in the family now that would be telling replied jared well almost everyone gets married and has kids of their own i guess grandmum is still waiting for uncle fred and uncle george to settle down but neither of them are willing to give up being bachelors uncle bill is the first to get married then uncle charlie all their kids are boys too aunt ginny got married too and has her own family with the only girl out of all of you i an only child you re an only child asked ron not that he was eager to have as many children as his parents but it did seem odd to him that he would only have one child mum had some scarring from one of the attacks before answered jared you consulted both muggle doctors and wizarding healers both of them said that it would be difficult and dangerous for mum you werenttoo keen on having children after that but mum managed to convince you to have me so here i am she almost died when i was born there was a lot of bleeding so after that you said no more and that i was perfect already oh ginny raised her hand to get some attention you mentioned that most of us get married but you didntsay anything about percy her voice was quiet because she and ron were still rather sore about percy behavior in the previous year jared didntlook at either of them for a moment and looked down at his hands i wouldntknow anything about uncle percy he whispered he died before i was born it was like ginny and ron were looking at a reflecting pool and someone had dropped a stone distorting what they were staring harry looked at each of them and saw that ginny had a breath caught in her throat ron shook his head from the shock when did he die i mean when he is going to die he demanded in a whisper i dontknow answered jared by the time i was born no one wasnttalking about him much all i remember are the pictures over the mantel in the burrow grandmum would put them up while granddad couldntlook at them at all the rest of the family went on with their lives but i think that there was always a void whenever there a family get together at the burrow there always a chair that remains empty at the table i would have liked to know him ginny got up abruptly and left without a word she didnteven bother to pick up the diary from ron on her way out she had gone upstairs as quickly as possible they heard her slam the door to the fifth year girls dorm ron ran his fingers through his hair but you re not here to stop that are you you re here to keep me alive he whispered jared nodded and glanced at harry we should find out how and where we know the why and the who said harry i got word for remus about it he said that there isntanyone known as magus according to the ministry records he said that he was able to get your father to help but your dad was wondering why i d ask ron we need to focus we need to find out what will happen it not just you whose in danger so is hermione and jared there a chance that magus already knows that jared is here he was desperate to get ron to focus on something else i know whispered ron he got to his feet i feeling tired i think it time we all go to bed come on jared jared looked at harry briefly before he got to his feet and followed his father harry followed reluctantly after them jared got into bed half expecting ron to tuck him in but fell asleep before he could draw the curtains closed ron shook his head again and got up to close them for him an does jared have a girlfriend no he actually single and he kind of a free spirit he does have two best friends like his father did but he isntinterested in his close female friend it funny as the story goes along that i developing more of a world where jared is from and what kind of people he knows anyway this is a very short chapter and it supposed to be if anyone else has a pressing question please dontask for when the next update will be i say in the journal i ll post the answer in the notes as disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter seventeen the morning after the following morning ron was the first one up and got ready early he had finished the work that hermione had given him and tacked on his prefect badge with pride before going down it was still the weekend but that didnt mean he was going to take a break by any means first he had to make sure that ginny was all right she was more upset than he was the previous night however ron knew he could never make it up the stairs also as much as he didntwant to he had to tell ginny not to write home and tell them about percy ron paced back and forth waiting hermione came down first ron stared at her as she came down from the girls staircase she seemed surprised to see him he felt his breath caught in his throat when she looked at him before there was someone else in the room but now they were alone in the common room in the early morning hours ron good morning arentyou up a little early asked hermione as she continued down the stairs the hazy morning glow from the window framed her form as she seemed to glide down the stairs she gave him a quizzical look as she asked ron are you even wake you re not answering me ron blinked to get his brain working again i awake he managed to look away from her for a moment before adding i ve never been more awake in my whole life did you sleep well she asked as she walked up to him you look a little tired ron felt exposed in front of her he was wondering if she could read his thoughts or not there were times that hermione could do that were her lips always so dewy or was that his head he cleared his throat ahem i finished the work that we had for the prefect i even took care of next week s here hermione accepted the bundle of parchments she blinked in surprise you did she asked she smiled as she shook her head i starting to think i losing my touch ron why you re doing all of your work without me telling you all of a sudden and jared giving me a challenge in class it like he threw down a gauntlet or something i have to keep pushing myself to beat him yesterday he stocked up on supplies of parchments and quills he went to honeydukes and bought a supply of sugar quills even hermione you donthave to beat him said ron calmly he couldntreally explain to her that jared was just that way because of her he was starting to think that they had created a monster that consumed lots of sugar and studied too hard so he has a stock of sugar quills yes he a bad as you when it comes to sweets she confirmed with a nod maybe that why i like him so much he reminds me of you except he a little easier to get along with she added with a laugh as along as academics arentinvolved you do everything so well hermione said ron as he looked at her again nothing really looks that hard for you it all comes so naturally which is amazing considering that you dontcome from a wizarding family he paused as he looked away from her feeling somewhat embarrassed as he added you re perfect hermione laughed no one is perfect ron please i not perfect if i was things would be a lot easier i a control freak i admit to that when it comes to things i also driven to prove that i have a right to be witch because i not from a wizarding family i drive people mad because of it sometimes all right most of the time for you and harry anyway the three of us make interesting friends dontwe commented ron harry has this grand destiny and you re already a great witch me i just in my potential stage he thought of what his future held his future was sitting next to him while the extension of her was sleeping up in the boys dorm you ll turn out all right hermione assured him she wasntso sure why she was so positive of it but she went on you shouldntcompare yourself to anyone else be who you are not what you think you should be ron nodded as they both sat down she was so close to him that she could smell her shampoo part of him wondered how she would react if he put his arm around her shoulders that would have been too forward so he stopped himself he cast a sidelong glance at her and saw that jared indeed inherited her eyes including the long thick eyelashes that went along with them he recalled the picture in his mind of her and their son jared definitely took more after her in his earlier years it wasntuntil he started to grow and develop did he begin to look more like ron are you really going to spend christmas with your family this year he asked it was too early to be asking that question it was more than a month away yes i donthave much of a choice my grandmother is throwing this big dance said hermione i sixteen so it kind of a big tradition in her family that they throw one of these even though one is only an adult at the age of eighteen it been ongoing in my family for generations this was the first time that ron had ever heard of hermione family let alone hearing about muggles that way her grandmother sounded like one of those pureblood wizards like malfoy my grandmother almost had a heart attack when she found out that my mum wanted to marry my dad they met while they were in school my dad comes from a working class family so she didntthink he d amount to anything even though they were already in graduate school to become dentists ron shook his head and sighed she glanced at him as he began his explanation it funny how things run so much the same between the wizarding world and the muggle one as you know being a pureblood is a big deal coming from a long line gives you a distinction having money can elevate your status even more you may have money hermione but you re below me and harry if harry wasnt famous he would be below me in status as well his mum was a muggle born witch as well his father considered a blood traitor in certain circles i a pureblood and my family known throughout england when bill and charlie were abroad they found out that they were known by their names ron eyes widened as his own works sank in oh merlin what asked hermione startled by the look on his face what wrong ron leaned over as he realized that was why jared was so upset about being asked about his lineage of course ron name and blood gave him the status as coming from a distinguished line but hermione lineage would make things more difficult for jared it wasnther fault of course it was the wizarding world bigotry jared and even harry as well as others like them represented to the purebloods a threat people who could walk around coming from distinguish lines and not being purebloods at all ron parents especially his father always taught him to be tolerant of muggles his father had spent a whole career devoting himself to ensuring that muggles were treated properly ron was always extremely defensive whenever malfoy called hermione a mudblood ron remembered the time that jared almost broke malfoy arm and now the anger raged in him if it had been up ron malfoy wouldnthave been walk at all it just not fair he said finally as he faced hermione you jared and harry shouldntbe persecuted just for being something they canthelp it so stupid now there no reason for you to get angry right now said hermione gently there nothing you can do about it ron took one look at her face and allowed himself to calm down he could feel her warmth and for a moment he was able to not think of anything else but her until they were interrupted by someone coming down good morning they turned to see and jared greeted them again good morning you guys are up early he grinned at them he was dressed in clothes that ron knew he paid for and that hermione had picked out for him jared clothes fitted him perfectly and were newer than anything ron ever had growing up his shoes made him a little bit taller than ron but he glided over hermione stared at his feet do you have skates in your shoes yep he responded jared went on it was a bribe from my mum it was the only way she was going to get me into harrod this year they werentcheap he grinned a smile worthy of the cheshire cat ron gave him a look that made jared wipe the grin right off of his face it makes it easier to go to class without magic and the other kids use them in america jared sounded sheepishly why dontwe go and get breakfast as soon as harry up asked hermione ginny normally went to go for breakfast with luna during most weekends ron couldnthelp but continue the conversation that jared had started so your mother dresses you no she doesn t said jared she just picks out the clothes at the store and tells me to wear them it either that or go naked she dresses you insisted ron jared opened his mouth than closed it and sighed as his shoulders slacked yes my mother dresses me ron stop picking on him scolded hermione your mother buys your clothes nope not really corrected ron i wear hand me downs so technically she dressed my brothers not me hermione rolled her eyes like that any better ron i happen to like how jared dresses jared shrugged the nice earth tones bring your eyes they were her eyes figures you d like his clothes muttered ron under his breath hermione whirled on him and before she could demand that he repeated himself he said i was just muttering to myself i didntsay anything you want to hear hermione would have said something but jared laughter stopped her all together hermione started at him and looked perplexed for a moment as she turned to look at ron who was having a hard time keeping a straight face she couldnthelp but think that the two were up to something but that was impossible they didntlike each other or did they when did that happen finally jared had calmed himself down you two sure like to argue dontyou he asked i dont even know why i asking i should be used to it by now ron head wrinkled in wonder part of him was glad that jared didntseem all that traumatize but another part of him was thinking that there was something warped about him being so calm when his parents were arguing however the way he reacted before to that other argument helped ron to understand that jared knew the difference between playful arguments and hurtful ones jared offered ron you want to try the shoes i sure they ll fit you ron looked at them dubiously and shook his head you re going to hurt yourself on those are you sure they re safe jared rolled his eyes at him i mean you could really hurt yourself on those ron i didntknow you cared said hermione playfully you sound like your mother that made ron ears turn red jared shrugged and sat down in an armchair next to them i dontsound like my mum muttered ron yes you do insisted hermione she turned to explain to jared you haventmet ron mum she a very nice woman but a bit of a worrier ron exclaimed he knows that hermione turned to him and asked how would he know that he hasntmet her jared quickly said ginny and harry were telling me things i gathered that no they didn t he already knew that his grandmum had a tendency to hover over her grandkids when they were little she wouldntlet him do anything fun like jump off the furniture at the burrow for fear that he might break something on his body i also heard about mr weasley very interesting man i met the twins still i d say ron is the strangest one out of all of them said hermione her eyes glowing with good humor jared nodded in agreement to which ron exclaimed i am not and if you haventnoticed i still here harry had come down during that time stretching his arms and yawning he saw the three of them together and blinked good morning he greeted why are all of you here just talking said jared as he got to his feet he turned to ron and hermione does this mean we can go to breakfast now ron nodded as hermione got to her feet he didntget up just yet actually you two go on ahead i need to talk to ginny but she not up yet i ll join you after i talk to her hermione could tell that something was wrong so she reluctantly agreed fine we ll see you later ron try not to take too long okay ron nodded let go i hungry ron continued to wait for ginny to get up he ended up waiting for a good half hour before ginny came down the stairs quietly she was dressed as if she was going to go outside ron could see an envelope in her pocket sticking out she didnt seem to notice him as she made her way towards the door it wasntuntil ron stood up and called her did she bother to turn and notice ginny ginny pivoted around somewhat startled by him ron what are you doing here arentyou supposed to be down for breakfast already she barely looked into his eyes as he folded his arms over his chest look i fine ron you didnthave to wait up for me i ll handle it my own way ginny whispered ron as he placed his hands over her shoulders listen to me what i about to tell you you re not going to like it going to be hard but you cantsay anything to anyone about what going to happen to percy because that the way things are going to be ginny i thought about it too i thought long and hard about it i woke up early to think about it some more it going to happen there isntanything we can do to stop it not even writing a letter to mum dad or any of our brothers is going to change the outcome jared already explained why he here and we give any warning we might end up doing some damage that we cantallow for jared meant to be here to save himself along with me and hermione he not here to change what going to happen to percy ginny looked up at him trembling her eyes were filled with tears as she whispered it not a letter to any of them it a letter to him it not to warn him because i know that he wontbelieve me i just want to make sure that i square things with him or at least try even if he meets up with jared and gets told everything he wontbelieve it because i know him it not fair ron i supposed to have six older brothers not five it not fair it not fair she sobbed and started to pound her hands against ron chest he did the only thing he could he placed his arms around her and pulled her close letting her cry as much as she wanted to ron murmured things that he didntbelieve himself most of it ginny couldnthear all he could really do to comfort himself and her was hold her maybe that was good enough jared harry and hermione were having breakfast together and were almost done waiting for ron it wasntthat jared was insensitive about percy being dead but in his time percy had been dead for years he cursed himself for making such a careless slip he was getting far too comfortable for his own tastes hermione was sitting next to harry while jared sat across from harry they didntrealize how long they were waiting until luna came up to the table after greeting them she asked where is ginny she hasntcome down for breakfast yet has she not as far as we know replied hermione looking up at her luna gave a glance towards jared who looked her square in the eye what about ronald didnthe come down with you no he wanted to talk to ginny about something answered harry then he offered why dontyou join us i dontknow how long they re going to take he didntreally look hermione in the eye for most of the morning sure agreed luna as she took the seat next to jared what do you suppose is keeping them her question was more directed to harry than anyone else jared shifted uncomfortably it wasntthat he didntlike luna in fact he adored her from the time he was little she was one of the people who babysat him and she told him the best stories however she had the uncanny ability to read people very well she could spot liars easily harry answered i not sure he took a sip of pumpkin juice from his goblet i sure it not anything important they re family sometimes it stuff between family members you know luna nodded as she started to put some food on her plate she was about to eat but she said you know jared i was just thinking that you reminded me of someone jared gave her a puzzled look you remind me of someone i not sure who she stared at him with her large blue eyes that seemed to bore into him she broke the stare to turn and look at hermione briefly you have hermione eyes she concluded that almost made harry choke on a piece of toast he immediately reached for his goblet and jugged some pumpkin juice quickly jared just stared at her with wide eyes hermione shook her head luna what are you talking about we re not related we just have brown eyes that it yeah agreed jared with a nervous laugh he knew that his mother was far too logically to listen to luna even if luna was right besides i american are you of english descent asked luna obviously unfazed by hermione previous reaction jared nodded both sides hmm what that supposed to mean harry broke in good morning ginny and you finally made it ron where did you go he was more than relieved that they had arrived what took you so long good morning ginny ronald greeted luna ron gave her a wry look before taking the seat next to hermione ginny took her place next to luna we were at the owlery we had to send a letter to our brother answered ron as he started pile some of the toast onto his plate at the same time jared picked up a piece of toast it was the last one on the plate hermione looked at ron and jared half expecting them to fight over a single piece of toast it was a bit of a surprised when ron withdrew his hand and said it yours ron said hermione jared had some already it okay said ron he can have it he stopped himself from saying that jared was a growing boy jared shrugged and took a bit out of the toast jared exclaimed hermione jared gave her a look as he sighed and offered the already bitten toast back to ron you already took a bite out of it what wrong with you oh said jared as he took back his toast and ate the rest of it ron was shaking his head grinning from ear to ear what are you smiling about demanded hermione as she glared at him harry started laughing what so funny i like toast said jared randomly have the rest said ron as he gave back what he had on his plate to jared which he accepted readily i ll have something else ginny eat something ron gave her a worried look please i not hungry ginny said as she looked at her brother i going to take a walk she announced as she got to her feet he gave a nod but didntsay anything to stop her she walked out of the great hall luna got to her feet soon afterwards and grabbed some of the food on the table placing it in a napkin i ll talk you all later see you luna left hermione broke the silence is everything all right ron i mean not just with ginny but with you are you all right i fine replied ron after this why dontwe go out for a walk too i mean all of four of us hermione agreed with a smile as the rest of breakfast went on as usual an the slip that jared made when he was explaining the shoes was on purpose he getting a little to comfortable what happens to percy runs in the following story runs at the same time as this part in temporal flux linking the stories together i wouldntsay they were part of a series the next chapter will take place some time after this back to the question of jared love life he wontbe getting any further assistance from the future other than the tools he has brought with him and the knowledge that he has as the story progresses jared will realize that he knows more about magus than he disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter eighteen unforeseen complications weeks began to pass without anything coming to light jared was getting more and more frustrated while ron ginny and harry were getting more and anxious about not knowing what was going to happen next it took a while before ginny could refocus again on things but she forced herself to because three people lives were in danger the only reason why jared left her alone during that time was because ron told him to it been weeks and there nothing on magus said jared it like he just waiting harry had a sudden realization that came to him the first attack was at the forbidden forest right i not so sure myself said ron as he nodded but why are we going over that again suddenly ron had an epiphany when he realized what harry was getting at every year dumbledore gives us the warning to stay out of there there are a lot of things in the forest that could harm us but it isntjust that the protection that available on the campus doesntextend to the forest jared got up that right i mean every year mcgonagall gives us the same warning mcgonagall becomes headmistress asked ron jared nodded after dumbledore retires i met him once when i was very little i kept calling him bumblebee you just laughed but mum was horrified when i did it in front of everyone but dumbledore didntmind at all he just laughed ron laughed too i figured that hermione would get upset over something like that it just funny she your mum she your wife you married her i mean you will marry her he made gesture that was completely unique to him ron noticed something that he didntnotice before because before he didntwant to look at him directly there was a faint scar along jared neck close enough to the jugular ron impulsively grabbed jared wrist alarming him what that on your neck asked ron roughly it nothing mumbled jared without pulling his wrist away i dontknow where i got it let me go dad he sounded frightened it was the last part calling ron dad that got ron to release jared wrist jared ran his thumb against it he looked away from harry and ron as he said it was there when i was eleven i dontknow how it happened either ari and alex seem to know but i never really wanted to know how it happened ari and alex pressed harry oh aristotle and alexandria my friends in hogwarts answered jared ari family is all muggles and he was sorted into gryffindor alex is in slytherin but she doesntreally fit in there she a sneaky one though you have a friend in slytherin asked ron utterly surprised jared nodded her father was a ravenclaw and her mother was a gryffindor she hates being called alexandria she okay with lexy or alex she prefers alex she a bit of a tomboy and she the slytherin seeker after professor malfoy pushed for her to be the seeker on a second year it made it so that they won the cup for three years in a row now ron was going into sheer shock malfoy becomes a professor well someone had to replace mcgonagall when she becomes head of the school there also professor longbottom he teaches herbology and of course harry you re the defense against the dark arts teacher along with being head of gryffindor it limits my trouble making immensely although i have found ways around you harry jared had a smile that could only be a weasley trademark for mischief making great muttered harry i cant believe malfoy becomes the transfiguration professor he fair but he always telling you that your students arentstudying enough actually on our first week he took two points off for each student who didntdo the reading i was the only one who did the reading said jared then again i did the reading during the summer i always do the reading during the summer it boring otherwise ron rolled his eyes you really are your mother son he shook his head you re also just as stubborn as her and you re really good at changing the subject arentyou i want to know how you got cut on your neck he sounded angry i told you i dontknow exclaimed jared just as angrily i dontremember what happened does it tingle asked harry quietly no answered jared it doesn t it just a normal scar i dontthink there anything magical about it i dontknow why mum insisted on not getting rid of it i sorry ron i didntmean to get mad about it it just that you dontreally say much about it you got really mad when i insisted on carrying out this plan and tried to stop me it looks like something that could bleed a lot murmured ron are you sure it nothing i mean why cantyou remember how it happened jared shook his head i wish i could tell you but i honestly dontremember most people dontnotice it until they get close enough to he looked at harry i mean you didntnotice and ginny didnt notice either he turned to look at ron figures you d notice you ve been looking closely at me for a while now mostly at my face though and i try to not draw any attention to it sometimes i forget that i have it ron couldnthelp but be alarmed at the scar on jared neck harry knew it too besides it was you who asked about mcgonagall being headmistress you changed the subject first now what were you two saying about the forest oh yeah said ron you see the forest only neighbor the grounds of the school the protection that over the school doesntextend as far as into the forest the maze that professor de luca set up was still on the grounds but magus must have tampered with the maze to get me and hermione into the forest harry continued the maze itself was built too close to the grounds he wontkill you jared because it all he has to really do is kill ron or hermione and you re out you ll never exist that why he hasntgone straight for you i wontlet anything happen to you or hermione said ron solemnly jared nodded because he knew that he was serious i can take care of myself you and mum taught me how said jared of course you re the most overprotective father alive you never let me do anything i surprised you let me go for the quidditch team last year you and mum agreed not to let me go for my third or fourth year on my second year there werentany open positions on the team what position did you make asked harry jared grinned as he replied keeper just like my dad ron was sort of confused about him being such a strict parent he was sure that he would have told his child to go out for the team as soon as there were open slots but to force jared to wait until fifth year to go out ron was sure that hermione wouldnthold jared back that much especially if jared liked playing quidditch as much as ron did ron didntlike that he sounded so much like his own mother she was the strict one so you can play quidditch you took me to my first game when i was ten days old said jared mum got plenty mad about that according to grandmum it was you and harry who took me mum made you promised her that you wouldnttake me to another game until i was old enough to sit up on my own i a born and breed chaudley canons fan grandmum which one would that be you ve got four grandparents said ron well your parents are called grandmum and granddad while my other grandparents the ones that i donthave to share with anyone else are called nana and papa clarified jared i sometimes help granddad with his tinkering in the shed i the only helper he got i dontmind fiddling with all of those muggle contraptions oh said ron i guess we just keep veering off topic said jared with a sigh anyway i guess what you two are trying to say as long as we stay on the grounds we should be plenty safe the three of us i mean harry nodded and sighed i guess we ll just have to stay close to the castle and the rest of the grounds i mean it not just jared or hermione ron it you he really after i mean we dontknow how you ll catch him even maybe we should just tell hermione said ron quietly jared shook his head furiously as harry gestured for him to be quiet i mean she might be able to figure something out we cantjust rely on her diary it obvious she doesntknow what really going on and she not stupid she probably thinking it unlikely that you re her son anyway because she got too much common sense to think otherwise jared nodded as harry spoke isntall of this somewhat illegal i mean i remember hermione warning me about the punishment for tampering with time jared shrugged you cantbe the son of an auror without learning how to avoid the law ron shook his head i ve created a monster as he gazed at jared who could only grin sticking close to the grounds was something that was relatively easy to do while school was in session as the holidays rolled around it became apparent that it wasntgoing to be possible when christmas break came along and the list was being past around to be signed hermione made the announcement that both jared and ron seemed to have forgotten over time you re not going to be here for the holiday asked ron as hermione nodded he was looking at her as if her head had popped off suddenly where are you going ron i ve been talking about this for weeks my grandmother is planning a huge ball i expected to attend there no way out of it even my dad tried but he couldntreason with my mum or nana she replied saying it slowly as if ron had lost most of his facilities ron sputtered b but you ve spent every holiday break with me and harry since our second year and i haventbeen with my parents for that long ron countered hermione jared and harry were playing chess nearby or at least they appeared to be playing chess ginny was sitting in an armchair curled up with her textbook they werentthe only ones listening to ron and hermione conversation hermione put her arms over her chest ron i ve spent more time with your family than my own i feel like i haventseen my parents in ages it was the first time that she ever really mentioned anything like that leaving ron a bit put off the other gryffindors were listening closely with their attention absolutely rapt almost everyone was doing the same thing because ron and hermione sounded so much like a couple and a married one at that but the silence from everyone else didnt last that long it was ginny who broke it you know ron she right hermione does spend a lot of time with our family it different with harry he doesnthave a decent family to go home too sorry about that harry she didnteven glance up from her textbook no problem muttered harry ginny continued not looking at the look on ron face and it not like we wonthave extra company anyway right jared you re not going back to america for the holiday so you wonthave anywhere to go would you i was going to sign up to stay over admitted jared hermione turned and looked at him why arentyou going home i mean i sure that your parents miss you dontthey she was trying desperately to get someone on her side jared looked at her and sighed i not going to get in the middle of this but no i dontthink my parents really miss me my mother hardly knows i here hermione brows furrowed as she said that a terrible thing to say i sure she worried about you being in england so you re going off into the muggle world to attend a party interrupted ron she was unwittingly making things difficult for him he did everything he could to make himself as friendly as possibly he even kept up with the boring prefect work for her he was about to say think of jared but hermione didntknow that he was her son great why are you so mad asked hermione i very rarely get to see them as it is i sorry maybe we should go home for the holiday ron suggested ginny as she closed her book ron gave her a wide eyed look he knew that ginny knew what the plan was and she was purposely messing it up what about jared he ll be here by himself for the holiday pointed out ron leave me out of this pleaded jared as harry piece destroyed one of his hey harry said you should pay better attention hey jared would you like to come along with us for the holiday invited ginny the more the merrier jared froze and looked at ginny well he cleared his throat that would be nice i suppose he took a hasty look at ron who was shaking his head if that okay with ron concluded jared hermione demanded why are you shaking your head like that ron you were the one who said he d be alone and you donteven want to invite him yourself that horrible she sounded utterly appalled that does it what does it what are you going to do demanded ron not liking the tone that she was using hermione turned her head toward jared who couldntignore what was happening how would you like to join me and my family for the holiday you said you ve spent some time in the muggle world jared now was trapped he could go with his father family or his mother family that wasntan easy decision to make he wanted someone anyone to intervene at this point he glanced at his father who looked a mad while his mother gave an expectant look he knew that fred and george knew who he really was and he could only imagine who else they told i ll do whatever harry is doing concluded jared passing off the responsibility to someone else all eyes were now on harry he could simply just say that he was staying at the school jared could see the quick thinking going on inside harry head he sighed and asked ginny does your invitation extend to me yes answered ginny promptly harry nodded then i ll join you and ron i guess i ll go too agreed jared what about you ron do i have to invite you to come home asked ginny sharply ron was backed into a corner he could tell that now everyone else was looking at him but it was the look in hermione eyes that made him decided quickly and impulsively we ll go together he looked at hermione again she seemed a little hurt perhaps she felt left out at the moment ron just didntcare he was furious at harry at the moment when everyone else had dispersed for the night jared was still forcing harry to play another game of chess with him he didnttake to losing very well something that he obviously got from his mother ron watched them for a few minutes before getting on his feet and walking over to them why did you just agree to not being on the grounds i thought we decided that this was the safest place demanded ron to harry harry looked up at him hermione very stubborn ron she was going to go whether you liked it or not at least if we re not on the grounds we can still go into the muggle world and check up on her i was wondering what was going on in that head of yours muttered jared he glanced at ron you re mad arentyou what was your first clue that vein in your head what vein you two are so much alike said harry ron jared a pain in the arse because you re a pain in the arse and it wasntfair to force him to choose between both sides of his family i dontknow the grangers that well so it wasntthat hard for me to decide you can go into the muggle world with two guides rather than one i mean i not much for the city but jared was raised in london i know the city but it might be different than what i remember i mean it got to be different said jared you do know where your grandparents house is there right asked ron jared nodded then this could work assuming that my parents will let us go into the muggle world dontworry about it i an expert at that sort of thing said jared almost proudly but the look ron face wiped the look off his face you ll be a handful wontyou asked ron as he got to his feet he continued yet i canthelp but blame myself for it i should go home if not to apologize to my parents for all the stuff i put them through you d better be one cute baby when you come along i think should be insulted by that retorted jared as he followed ron towards the staircase harry shook his head and followed the weasleys up the stairs neither jared nor harry knew why ron was really upset about not seeing hermione during the holidays one would think that ron would tire out after spending so much extra time with hermione his prefect duties allowed him close proximity to her he spent more time with her than anyone else yet never found away to get away from her nor did she the thought of not spending the holidays or even seeing her bothered him more than anything ron got into bed with that thought running through his mind he had been very good for the past few weeks about not thinking of hermione other than just his friend that he needed to protect every once in a while jared did an excellent job of reminding that she was so much more at those times ron would just think of hermione as the mother of his child he stared up at the canopy in a few days time he wouldntbe seeing her for a while not until the next year there was no denying that he was in love with her he wanted to be with her all the time with her everything was always fascinating and never boring at first he assumed it was because they were allowed to spend more time together because of harry crazy relatives he was uncomfortable with just being with her alone but soon he didntmind it so much hermione had a way of getting and keeping ron attention he wondered if she ever thought that way about him ginny had decided not to tell anyone about hermione thoughts on ron that she discovered in the diary ron sat up and saw that jared was sleeping soundly he had managed to kick off most of his blankets it gave something for ron to do at least he got to his feet and quietly padded over to jared bed slowly he put the blankets back on him ron got back into bed and thought about when how and why he didntnotice it before why didnthe realize that he was in love with her he must have been pretty dense because it took jared presence to get him to notice he was about to go to sleep but suddenly jared turned fretfully as if he was having a nightmare ron sat up again and watched as jared seemed to shake like he was cold ignoring everyone else in the room ron got up again and gently shook jared awake ron shook him until his brown eyes shot open you re having a nightmare jared he whispered loudly jared was gasping for air it okay you re fine it all right i fine said jared it just a reoccurring dream that all i fine i dontwant to talk about it dad ron saw the scar on his neck as clear as day under the moonlight he remembered over the last couple of weeks hearing jared thrashing about in his sleep but not doing anything about it ron reached out to touch the scar on his neck but decided against it ron sat on jared bed rubbing his back it was enough to comfort jared and induce him to go to back to sleep it was only then that ron was able to go to sleep an the conversation at the beginning has a couple of hints about what happened to jared the reason why the scar on jared neck wasntbrought up until now was because he had forgotten about it the scar is there but somewhat faded there is a reason why jared was kept from playing quidditch until his fifth year and there a bit time leap here especially for the next chapter the perspective kind of changed to ron end of things disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter nineteen across worlds when the holidays rolled around jared found himself traveling to the headquarters of the order of the phoenix at 12 grimmauld place the place was legendary during the time that jared came from it reminded as an important meeting place for the people that had followed dumbledore during the time of war it was jared first visit ever rather than packing his whole trunk along jared had packed his things in a backpack in order to be invited harry had to arrange it with the headmaster who gave permission and gave jared a piece of paper with the address of the place jared hadntseen what had happened between his parents but he did see ron and harry bide hermione a safe holiday she hugged them both but jared could see that she seemed to hold ron a bit longer it was also ron who lingered a bit longer after she had left we d better get a move on said ginny she turned and said to jared brace yourself i used to it said jared as he smiled although it going to be strange not getting a weasley sweater this year he glanced back at ron and harry who were walking behind them the door opened before they had a chance to even knock we saw you coming greeted fred as he looked at jared it always nice to have family over for the holidays and harry added george come on inside wait paused jared standing his ground does anyone else know about me fred and george just looked at him i knew it who did you tell what are you doing at the door fred george let them inside called molly from the background she pushed her way past her twin sons and came face to face with jared oh you must be jared blake from america welcome come on inside the rest of you it seemed like she had pulled them all inside in single instant before their coats and things were taken upstairs she was already fussing over them harry how are you all right mrs weasley said harry with a slight smile it a shame that hermione couldntmake it said mrs weasley as she seemed to take a sidelong glance at ron fred picked up on that and said why couldntshe make it family event replied ron as he took jared coat and put it away for him he didntdo that with anyone else s molly nodded and turned her attention to the new person in the room so your parents are in america where exactly what do they do mum you shouldntgrill him like that muttered ron los angeles my father is an auror and my mother is a healer replied jared smoothly enough they re busy and going all the way back there is way too stressful i see but that doesntmean that we cantmake you feel at home said molly with a smile she turned her attention back to ron and ginny bill and charlie should be back soon your father is busy at the ministry what about percy asked ginny impulsively there were identical scowls on fred and george face have you heard from him lately molly shook her head pressed her lips together ginny looked at ron for some help and he swallowed jared looked at each one of the members of his family in the room i think i ll have to out and do some christmas shopping he announced i have to pick up something for my parents i ll go into muggle london for it go where the muggles are asked molly startled at the boldness of jared statements but they re wizards arent they yes they are answered jared my mother is muggle born my father a pureblood from a long well known line it really more for her than him my dad never really asks for anything it makes it kind of hard to shop for him isntit your father money anyway asked ron i mean you said you got your pocket money from him anyway so i did said jared with a blink are you telling me not to get anything for my father for christmas ron nodded okay ron stop meddling in other families affairs scolded molly if he wants to get something for his father he should let take you things upstairs said george he picked up jared pack you didntbring a trunk i didntfeel like it said jared before he followed everyone else upstairs he turned and said thank you for extending your hospitality mrs weasley molly seemed a little surprised but smiled what wonderful manners you have you parents must have done a good job raising you good manners are always a good indication of that so far agreed jared as he glanced at ron who was the last person waiting for him at the top of the stairs who was smirking at him a little he followed him up the stairs and into one of the rooms there was an extra cot that looked a bit uncomfortable with two other beds the twins had set their things down while ginny went off to the other room you take the bed i ll take the cot said ron gruffly it doesntlook very comfortably but it ll do it okay i can sleep on the cot argued jared you donthave to give it up on my account fred interrupted you know fatherhood suits you ron normally you d get all whiney about having to sleep on something like that ron cheeks got red so how long before you tell mum and dad about their grandson we re not telling them hissed jared and keep your voices down or at least shut the bloody door you look so much like your dad i surprise our mum didntnotice said george i guess hermione coloring makes for good cover i suppose you re just as smart as her too arentyou you two are sadistic you just like watching people squirm muttered jared he crossed his arms over his chest and scowled at fred and george harry was having a hard time keeping a straight face in fact he was snickering and you never answered me who else did you tell about me neither fred nor george had to give an answer because ginny opened the door following behind her were bill and charlie bill firmly closed the door behind them and jared pulled away from the twins with a wave of his hand i was born into a family of big mouths he muttered in defeat no one here can keep a secret he glanced at ron who looked a little pale at his oldest brothers at least one of you hasntlearned how to keep a good secret yet we had to tell them because they were the only ones who could help us with the search on our end said fred george added besides you re lucky we didntsend any birth announcements out to the rest of the family i guess you already know who we are said bill as he held out his hand to jared who shook it without look at him directly he also shook hands with charlie he really does look like you ron i mean i had my doubts but now looking at him you can see that he a weasley charlie did one better when he started walking around jared looking at him at all angles he picked up one of jared hands and observed just like yours and dad s nice slender fingers do you mind snapped jared as he pulled his hand back stop touching me ah that temper said charlie somewhat fondly we were doing some of the research on magus it seems that we haventbeen able to find anything on him i mean there more than one name like that it can be a first or a last name so it hard to narrow things down i ve asked around too added bill either this man hasntcommitted a crime yet or he hasntbeen caught for a previous one we re trying our best yeah agreed ron we should have stayed at hogwarts but hermione had to go out to some kind of family event so we had to go out too just in case actually we need you to help us out with mum and dad no problem said bill we can help out with that i sure that you d like to see her ron ron shook his head immediately but his ears were turning red under the gaze of his siblings jared and harry okay and jared probably wants to see his mum anyway dontyou i d like to see my grandparents too admitted jared i dontget to visit with them as often as i like not since i started in hogwarts it sometimes hard to go back and forth between the worlds as i get older i dontget to spend as much time among the muggles he saw the looks on their faces it half my heritage i cantignore it i proud to be a half blood we understand said charlie reassuringly of course you cantignore it i bet my dad really happy to have some connection to the muggle world he uses it as an excuse to go shopping in the muggle world i had a lot of toys growing up confirmed jared with a smile it was the first smile that any of his uncles had seen they seemed marveled by it it was enough to make jared uncomfortable mum bound to notice that said bill quietly he got your smile ron except for that slight dimple on his cheek ron glance at jared briefly that from his mum he concluded come on let go downstairs mum going to wonder what taking us so long hermione sighed as she glanced around her childhood bedroom she finally plopped onto the bed and sighed again she stared up at the ceiling it was so quiet at home too quiet she found herself missing all the bustling and noise of the castle at hogwarts she wondered what was happening with her friends she wondered what they were doing at the exact moment that she was laying in her bed she grabbed a pillow on her bed and hugged as hard as she could she remembered last year when she had argued with ron about her going skiing with her parents but she only argued with him because he got her ire up she didnt like him insulting things that he didntunderstand especially things about the muggle world at least harry was easier to get along with compared to ron but it wasntas stimulating however she reflected that ron had been very good and nice lately up until he found out that she wasntgoing to be there for the holiday in fact he was downright upset about it hermione also thought that she was rather impulsive for inviting jared to come with her no doubt that her father would have had a few choice words to say about him hermione didnthave such feelings towards jared but she couldnthelp it she did care about what happened to him jared had a handsome smile that was what she noticed about him it was very much like ron s now that was a startling thought as she sat up jared did have ron smile hermione shook her head frantically that was impossible or was it she covered her lips with her fingertips as she thought about it it was liable to cause her a headache if she continued to think about it she was far too logical to consider it but she remembered on her third year with the time turner of course she turned it back in when she decided to have a regular schedule instead of trying to take on too many classes at once she must have been mad that year for biting off more than she can chew funny she didntsee him wearing one that one time she saw him struggling with his shirt it was very strange indeed he had to have one on him somewhere then again once one does the spell with the time turner one could remove it and go on without it harry didnthave to keep wearing hermione time turner the whole time they went back in their third year hermione wasntgoing to get enough time to dwell on it because her mother was knocking on her door hermione dear called her mother are you all right yes mum responded hermione as her mother opened the door her mother was a beautiful woman with warm brown eyes and brown hair she was also thin and willowy many people had compared hermione to her mother but she still didntsee what the fuss was about her mother smiled at her viola granger took a seat on hermione bed next to her so how do you like the dress i know it wasntwhat you picked out for yourself from the wizarding boutique but your grandmama would prefer if you had something more in vogue you can save that other dress for another occasion but i like it better than the one that she decided on isntdad upset about it asked hermione as she got to her feet she was referring to the fact that the dress was completely open in the back the wizarding gowns were wonderfully old fashion with their large skirts the dress that her grandmother had picked out was a custom made number it was a light bluish grey color with some sequins and the back was opened it was like a halter top tying in up at the back of her neck the skirt was long but a bit loose it still accented her curves and showed much more skin than she preferred rather the dress had been designed to show the few curves that she did possess in short hermione hated it viola stood up and looked at the dress from behind her daughter the fabric is beautiful and the shoes that go with it are gorgeous i ll deal with your father if he had it his way he d dress you in lots of ruffles and bloomers with an overcoat to cover the whole thing you re a young woman now hermione so you should start learning to be comfortable in your own skin i d rather wear what dad wants me to wear than this muttered hermione with distaste as she reached out and touched the material it was silk but she expected that from her grandmother i dontwant to wear it where anyone can see me canti just wear the dress that i picked out for myself she was pretty close to pleading with her mother it up to you said viola your grandmother said it was such a beautiful dress but if you have no problem upsetting her then you can wear your dress hermione was furious at the manipulation that her mother was employing because it was working she folded her arms over her chest as she threw her mother an angry glare viola placed her hands on hermione shoulders and tried to soothe her hermione just please just this once could you be a good girl and just do this it degrading muttered hermione sullenly i wontwear i want to wear the dress that i picked out for myself the one that you let me pick out for myself viola suppressed the urge to sigh she knew her daughter was extremely stubborn it was a trait that she had inherited from her father little did viola know that this stubbornness would be magnified further in the generation after her daughter she gave her daughter an encouraging smile which was something that hermione hadntexpected you know someday you ll look back on this argument hermione and realize how unimportant it is you donthave to make a battle out of everything you need to learn how to pick your battles better i just hope that if you have a child you ll be understanding hermione still had her arms folded over her chest but she softened a bit what makes you think anyone would want to be with me and have a family with me i know what grandmama party is really about she wants to show me off the noble families and royals have key members who are old enough to marry she lost her chance with you when you married dad viola recalled the morning that hermione came home hermione had mentioned that her friend ron had wanted her to go along with him and the others michael wasnttoo happy about it he kept telling viola that ron weasley was more interested in hermione than just being friends michael had become more and more wry of ron after meeting the young man again over the summer at diagon alley viola had made the comment that ron was growing into a fine young man as they walked together down the street michael didnteven view viktor krum as a threat but he expressed how much he disliked ron all of his reason were thoroughly illogical viola gave her daughter a smile what are you thinking mum asked hermione try not to think of your grandmother party as a trap in the making you ve got a good head on your shoulders hermione and you already know what you want so it best just to enjoy yourself i allow you to be as smug as you want to be i wish i already had someone to go with me though it would be so much easier than trying to come up with excuses not to dance i guess i will have to come up with more creative ways to get away from them you are not to leave the grounds under any circumstances do you hear me hermione ordered viola warningly i am serious and you know you are not to use magic in the muggle world and outside of your school do you understand hermione nodded which her mother returned with a smile she sighed and told her daughter sometimes i think those friends of yours are a bad influence on you maybe agreed hermione as her mother walked towards the door or i could have gotten it from dad viola gave a shake of her head and sighed your father is coming dontlisten to him when he says that he isn t now you get some rest there dinner at your grandmother tonight is dad coming asked hermione viola nodded of course he is unless of course someone calls with some kind of emergency the grangers had a joint private practice that they ran together they switched back and forth for any emergencies michael granger had met viola blake while they were in dentistry school and they had gotten married as soon as they had graduated after they established their practice they decided to have children viola was just as slim and fine boned as her daughter and she could only have one child with their busy practice the grangers only managed to produce one child so everything worked out one could swear the adage of girls marrying men like their fathers was true in hermione case her father and ron had a lot in common in the way of personality later on michael would take ron to his first football game along with jared just to get away from hermione grandmother for a couple of hours on end michael would come to think of ron as his own son rather than just as a son in law which made hermione very happy for his part ron disliked going into the muggle world without hermione or her parents as guides to it and jared would lean how to travel back and forth between both worlds he was after all a half blood and his mother was insistent on him learning about both cultures he was born into there was a soft knock on the door and michael opened it before viola could even open it there you are he said he smiled at his daughter as he turned his full attention to his wife do i have to go tonight you asked that question this morning and at lunch the answer is still the same yes you have to go answered hermione mother she folded her arms over her chest and you re setting a bad example michael for your daughter michael glanced at hermione as he sighed and rolled his eyes she too much like you to follow anyone example she the one who sets them not the other way around i suppose i will have to go just to not abandon her to the clutches of that viola cut him off you say one more thing about my mother and you ll be sleeping alone tonight she crossed her arms over her chest for effect michael looked rather sheepish for the moment as hermione covered her mouth with her fingertips in an effort to keep from laughing out loud now what did you need from me asked her mother i couldntfind the shirt i suppose to wear tonight honestly you cantdo anything for yourself let go and set out your clothes for tonight so you wontdelay us why dontyou just tell me where it is because you still wontbe able to find it hermione dear get some rest you look very tired with that said her parents left her alone hermione closed the door behind her and rubbed her arms she glanced out the window for a brief moment she felt like something was watching her but it was nothing more but a raven it flew off just as soon as she had seen it breathing deeply she drew the curtains close feeling cold suddenly in her mind eye she was back in the forbidden forest but ron wasntwith her this time a ripple of fear came down her spine she immediately went to her school bag and pulled out her wand hermione clutched it tightly as she took another glance at the curtains then she stared at the door that her parents had just gone through slowly it sunk in she wasntthe only one in danger an ron has a chance to take a look at hermione world i decided to name hermione parents michael and viola i took the name viola out of shakespeare twelfth night since hermione name is also from a shakespearean play hermione grandmother name is miranda blake being her last name from the tempest michael granger really doesntget along with miranda it is only when his daughter will marry when he finally gets a good ally against the woman because miranda isnttoo fond of men in general she doesntlike ron either and the only man she will adore is jared hermione doesnthave ron there with her and she canttell her parents about what she just seen at the end the raven wontshow up where ron is because he in a safer location but hermione has left herself quite unprotected in the muggle world that wontbe for disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter two teacher pet jared managed to get into the same carriage as the others this time he was sitting right next to ron jared smirked at himself because hermione had almost sat next to him but ron stopped her at the moment ron didntlike him too much but not enough to make hermione sit next to jared feeling self conscious jared had the sleeves of his robes over his hands for the first time in his life he was just as tall as ron it was mind bending he was used to be looking up at him not seeing eye to eye jared was starting to wonder if anyone noticed any similarities between him and ron other than the height and body structure he pressed himself against the corner of the carriage was sitting in and slumped in his shoulders in an effort to make himself look smaller his shoulders were broad like ron s jared regretted getting into the same carriage as them he should have picked another one what wrong asked harry observing jared odd body language that was the last thing jared needed someone calling attention to him ron turned his head to face him their faces were a good distance apart from each other but jared was praying that ron wouldnt notice anything like his mother skin jared didnthave any freckles it was part of his cousins constant ribbing about him not really being a part of his father family it was just teasing but still it was always enough for jared father to get angry at them ron blue eyes peered into jared face please dontlet him notice my eyes for merlin sake let him not notice my eyes thought jared as he pressed himself even tighter against the corner of the carriage ron dont do that exclaimed hermione you re scaring him for no reason you ll be fine jared ron stop that ron retorted i wasntdoing anything to him i was just looking at him he looks like he sick or something not that i really care can you two not fight please requested harry i sorry i pointed it out just stop yes harry answered hermione all right mate agreed ron we can feel the love in here cantwe muttered jared earning a glare from ron i sorry it that impulse control thing again i really sorry no more just everyone be quiet until we get to the castle muttered hermione with a sigh please just stop it the rest of the carriage ride was peaceful jared stared impassively at the castle not very impressed by it at all as one would have expected they all climbed out of the carriage and everyone made their way to the halls except for jared he had to go talk to professor mcgonagall first and present his letter as an exchange student to her he had spent a good amount of time plotting his arrival but he knew what he wasntexpected the only hope he had of gaining access inside was to introduce himself first and then let them sort it out later hopefully by the time anyone realized who he was he would be long gone jared knew exactly where to find her professor mcgonagall would be welcoming the first years to the castle that was her position before she became headmistress back in his time and that what his parents had told him jared waited until all the first years were leaving ahead of her before approaching her hello he said professor mcgonagall gave him a look do i know you young man i dontbelieve i ve ever seen you before she asked which house are you from actually i just arrived i the american exchange student jared blake the papers were sent ahead of time my transcripts should have arrived by now surely you knew that i was coming she shook her head i dontbelieve the headmaster has received any notice of your arrival mr blake which school did you come from the los angeles institute of magic and technology replied jared it a special school in california oh it the one that was just built lots of the students are muggle born children who would like to learn a trade in the muggle world because the wizarding population isntas concentrated in the us as it is here in england but i sorry i haventreceived any notice of your arrival mr blake that a shame i just came all the way here on the train for nothing then said jared we ll go and talk to the headmaster after the dinner the first years need to be sorted so you ll just have to take a seat with the other students until we figure out what happened said professor mcgonagall in a hurried tone as she steered jared towards the great hall jared automatically went to the gryffindor table out of sheer habit he took his seat at the end earning lots of questioning looks he glanced around and realized what he had done it seemed only natural for him to seat at his house table he choose to ignore the looks and everyone soon forgot about him as the sorting began it took a while to get the sorting done because of the usual cheering in between each announcement professor albus dumbledore stood up at the head of the head table ready to make his annual announcements for jared it was like watching history come to life he had had heard lots of things about professor dumbledore and read a great deal about him too and there he was in all of his glory with his long white beard and his blue eyes twinkling over his glasses another year at hogwarts has begun he started first off i would like to welcome all of our first years and i have just been informed that a student from the united states has joined us i believe he sitting at the end of the gryffindor table jared blake jared wondered if his ears were red because he could feel the heat rising out of them he gave a short wave from where he was ron and hermione were sitting closer to the front and hermione smiled at him it was almost reassuring for jared i do hope that he will find his experience here enlightening as well as challenging as for another announcement we have a new defense against the dark arts instructor please welcome demetrius de luca from italy he has graciously agreed to join us the professor looked very young for his age he had black curly hair and dark brown eyes a lot of the girls were already swooning at the sight of him jared noticed one thing that would probably crush all of their hopes de luca was wearing a white collar he was a priest would you like to share a few words asked professor dumbledore to de luca our last dada professor got to make a speech would you like to not really i just want to say that i look forward to seeing all of you replied de luca saying the last part louder so that everyone could hear him there was chattering from the girls about his italian accent on to other business this year is going to be a hard one because of the recent revelations about voldemort return there was a gasp from most of the people only some of slytherins looked a little smug the safety of the students here is tantamount to everything else there will be restrictions this year that are beyond the control of this school first of all the weekends at hogsmeade have been restricted to only half the normal outings there was lots of groaning from most everyone second as with previous years no one is allowed in the forbidden forest as forewarned by one of our teachers it is not the safest place for certain individuals however i do not want anyone to be afraid to learn that is what you are here for but i want all of you to be aware of the situation look to the head boy head girl and the prefects under them remember to also not use magic in the halls and if you want to see the list of objects banned from the school please talk to mr filch now everyone tuck in the food appeared on jared plate and he slowly started to eat someone tapped him on the shoulder to his surprise it was neville did you need something he asked harry said you should be sitting with us answered neville you will be joining gryffindor wontyou jared blinked at the question he hadntreally thought of that he was a gryffindor through and through but he was starting to think that going to either ravenclaw or hufflepuff would have been a better idea he thought about it again and nodded he had to keep an eye on things in gryffindor and what better way than to be there in person then come and sit with us urged neville jared got to his feet and slowly walked over to where they were all seated ginny introduced him to other members of the house jared nodded and acknowledge each of them this time he was sitting next to harry nervous asked harry kind of admitted jared as he glanced at hermione who was discussing something with ron they were discussing their prefect duties jared always thought that she was beautiful having inherited her softer features jared turned his attention to ron it would take a bit longer for ron to come into his own he was a long way off from the man he was going to really be maybe the old adage was true girls do mature faster than boys at least that what jared thought he noticed that harry was following his gaze i just surprised covered up jared because i thought fighting was the only way they talked to each other his voice was low enough not to be heard by either ron or hermione harry shook his head but wore a knowing grin on his face the dinner drew to a close and hermione announced first years you ll be coming with us ron was on his feet jared got to his feet and was about to go to with harry until he remembered that he was supposed to meet with professor dumbledore first jared walked up to the head table as the rest of the great hall slowly emptied out he didntlook back to see where everyone was going mr blake there seems to be a problem with your transcripts arriving professor dumbledore informed him without any announcement of your arrival we are trying to assess the situation quickly jared realized that the staff probably thought he was a security risk someone had to vouch for him in order to stay he squared his shoulders as he saw the eyes of the professors on him the only two people who werentgiving him of suspicion were dumbledore and de luca the latter was giving him an almost impassive look de luca stood up and walked up to dumbledore and whispered something in his ear jared held his breath and waited our dada professor does not deem you as a danger concluded dumbledore you are free to stay in hogwarts i dontthink the sorting hat is necessary you already know which house you belong to i take it gryffindor answered jared with some relief thank you very much he nodded at de luca who barely acknowledged him he turned a little and then realized that he was supposed to not know where he was going um where do i go now professor mcgonagall is the head of your house i sure she would be more than happy to show to gryffindor tower answered professor dumbledore good night jared good night professor good night all of you said jared as professor mcgonagall swept down to him and he followed her jared didntsee the professors separate for the evening dumbledore gestured for severus snape and demetrius de luca to follow him what did you say to him demanded professor snape facing de luca the sneakoscope that i carry in my pocket vibrated but i dontsense any evil from the boy answered de luca i dontthink he here to harm anyone headmaster how can you allow him to stay here if his intentions are false asked professor snape dumbledore smiled a little i believe that boy has a purpose for being here and we cannot simply turn him away based on so little evidence we will have to wait and see what happens with him we will keep ourselves aware of the situation agreed de luca snape didntseem all that convinced of the situation but he gave a stiff nod of agreement there was something strangely familiar about jared blake yet no one could really place him jared hurried along to walk side by side with professor mcgonagall he had nothing but respect for the woman and she had the ability to scare the dickens out of him they walked along for a moment without saying a word professor mcgonagall said your things have been placed into the sixth year boy dormitory the security at gryffindor tower is one of the tightest around hogwarts because of harry potter surmised jared without looking at her i know about what happened last year the news does travel to the us of course agreed professor mcgonagall i am reluctant to have you in my house as well as in this school especially without any transcripts hogwarts does have a certain level of excellence to maintain mr blake jared was tempted to tell her that he was the top of his class and considered one of the smartest wizards of his age he gave a tight nod instead thank you for your vote of confidence professor mcgonagall he said politely there was no reason for him to be rude his mother always told him that he should only be rude when he had something good to gain from it not just to simply get his way his voice held a touch of sarcasm but then again he had his father in him too jared knew where he had to be when they stopped in front of the portrait of the fat lady password she asked pixie dust replied professor mcgonagall the fat lady swung open and they stepped through the portal almost everyone was in the common room talking and playing games they all looked with interest at jared some of the girls were whispering to each other professor mcgonagall cleared her throat to silence the chatter and whispering as you all know this is jared blake from the los angeles institute of magic and technology he will be joining us for this academic year and has chosen gryffindor as his house please make an effort to welcome him good night and remember to get some rest classes are starting tomorrow with that professor mcgonagall departed for the evening hello everyone said jared feeling his face getting red with shy embarrassment and waved weakly he kind of gave a weak laugh and took down his hand wondering if he looked as stupid as he felt at the moment welcome to gryffindor greeted hermione it great that you re here lavender brown and parvati patil came over to introduce themselves they were giggling at jared making him extremely uncomfortable like his father he was a late bloomer where girls were concerned furthermore these girls were actually older than him by a couple of years jared maintained a polite veneer through the whole thing as other students introduced themselves and asked him questions about los angeles hermione was the only one who was really interested in what kind of studies he had experienced aboard jared assured her that it was like hogwarts when ten o clock rolled around jared was happy that it was time for bed and practically ran up the boys staircase to the sixth year dorm he noticed that his trunk was positioned in front of a bed but not the same bed he was used to in fact ron had that position instead jared changed quickly and trooped over to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face he was meticulous about flossing and making sure his teeth were clean soon he was in bed with the curtains drawn snuggled under warm blankets it felt like being home the first day of school was an eventful one and that was an understatement by the end of the day hermione detested jared while ron took a liking to him it begun very innoxiously in the first class they had together apparently jared transcripts had arrived there was a trick to them they were real transcripts but the name of the school was switched it was clear that jared was a brilliant student the first class that jared had with his fellow gryffindors was transfiguration professor mcgonagall asked a question jared hand flew up just as quickly as hermione s that was the first time anyone had ever seen that professor mcgonagall was a little stunned herself and called on jared he answered promptly and correctly the following question was answered by hermione it went back and forth like that the next question was the same and the one after that and the one after that neville was sitting next to jared and had to shift over several times to avoid jared hand while harry spent the entire time dodging hermione s by the end of class everyone was relieved and a bit frightened at the same the same pattern showed up in the next class which was potions the class was much more empty than last year because of the o w l results harry and ron scored high enough to place in the class which exceed the expectations of the potions master he decided to double check the scores personally when he saw the two come in and ron confirmed his scores on the o w l s harry didnt bother to say anything professor snape found some amusement by constantly calling on jared just to frustrate hermione it was becoming a disturbing game of who could rack up the most points for gryffindor draco along with his associates were having a good laugh at hermione expense no one was that impressed that jared could answer things correctly they were more impressed with the fact that he was beating hermione the next class was a little more in favor of hermione defense against the dark arts professor de luca greeted all of them with a warm smile he wore his collar like he had done the night before and had a rosary clipped to his side on a sash welcome to defense against the dark arts my name is demetrius de luca i come from rome italy i look forward to learning each and every one of your names i have seen the report left behind by your former instructor he said noting how last years students gave looks of distaste and hate at the mention of the awful toad umbridge jared looked around and shrugged it seems that last year there was a lack of practice except for those of you were members of the student club dumbledore army i want to talk to the students who ran it last year and discuss making it an official student organization no worries i have received permission from the headmaster who has deemed the class more than necessary anyone who wishes to join should be allowed admittance first off let me see just how much work we need to do i have a pop quiz for you what exclaimed ron can he do that he hissed to harry who shrugged his shoulders yes i can said professor de luca as he started to pass out the quiz no more talking when you get it and do not start until i can say you can he finished passing it out and said all right everyone begin you have ten minutes in less than five minutes jared put down his quill hermione saw that he was finished and wrote even faster she finished two minutes after him professor de luca glanced at the clock in the back of the room in three minutes time he announced times up quills down please passed them up harry please stop writing he smiled at harry who reluctantly put down his quill it turned out his answers were longer than either jared or hermione professor de luca looked at the quizzes and nodded all right let see go over the answers to this quiz those were the magic words because hermione and jared hands shot up into the air professor de luca laughed and looked around them not at them now now no should be shy anyone i guess i ll have to start calling random people then harry please answer the first question reluctantly hermione and jared put their arms down there was a sigh of relief as harry gave an answer to the first question very good harry ten points to gryffindor all right who wants to answer question number two because if no one volunteers i ll be asking one of the two people who will probably have their hands raised now hermione and jared flung their arms into the air again but this time everyone else raised their hands thank you very much ron do you know the answer to the second question ron nodded and gave a shaky unsure answer but was relieved when professor de luca said he was correct jared was mildly surprised because he always that ron was so unconfident professor de luca went down the list and didntcall on either hermione or jared at all for the quiz questions i am a firm believer in practicing against the dark arts but i also believe in knowing our adversaries therefore today lesson will not be found in the book for this class said professor de luca hermione reluctantly closed her book while jared stared at him impassively today lesson is a history lesson and unlike any history lesson you ve ever had in this school for the next fortnight i will be covering the history of the dark arts along with theories as to what motives such crimes it is not enough that you know how to do the spells but you must understand what you are up against now everyone books closed parchments out and quills ready everyone did as he asked and the rest of the lesson went without incident however jared was asking excellent questions earning praise from the professor hermione snapped her quill at least once and by the end of class was extremely irritated at jared she would have left immediately but had to stay behind with harry and ron to talk to the professor about da jared gave them a glance back as he walked of with neville to the common room professor de luca closed the door behind them i ve been asked by professor dumbledore to be the faculty advisor for dumbledore army seeing that i the dada professor i ve heard from other students what you three have been doing and i must say i find it very impressive now harry i will be supervising yes professor de luca said harry do not worry harry i donthave any intention of actually instructing the club other than watching your progress what happens in da is still up to you if you d like i can look over what you re planning on doing or help you come up with more things other than i i afraid that i will not be around as often to be really a true supervisor explained professor de luca ron cleared his throat and asked you re a priest arentyou a catholic priest that i am answered the professor with a nod i was trained by a special order of the jesuits so you will find my approach to teaching a bit strict i also have meetings to attend to in the ministry of magic on behalf of my order as well as for the headmaster there was a lingering something in the air that told the three students that professor de luca was also a member of the order of the phoenix you are free to go oh and hermione dontlet yourself get carried away as soon as the trio were outside harry and ron looked like they were waiting for hermione to blow up are you all right hermione asked ron nervously i mean it been quite a day for you hermione say something urged harry i ve never seen anyone do that to you hermione i mean you re taking it very well considering i mean jared like a male version of you i never thought i d see anyone like that added ron both harry and ron stood on either side of hermione i hate him declared hermione i ll beat him if it the last thing i do who does he think he is acting like he didntknow anything i hate him she stalked off ahead of them i glad she not taking it badly harry whispered ron with a grin on his face as harry started to double over with laughter jared had succeeded in two things getting ron to like him and giving harry something to laugh about of course he also incurred the wrath of hermione in the process and that was something he had never done his entire life an when i write a story sometimes i dontknow what to name a character and inspiration comes de luca is one of the few original characters along with jared who will be developed one has to wonder how he got hired if fudge is still picking out who the dada professor should be and it also kooks like jared got a bit of a dark side when it comes to schooling hermione has lost it but her drive for perfection and fear of failure as noted in j k rowling site are partly what make her an excellent student now let see if jared survives someone mentioned putting in a sorting hat song which i didntdo there are things that i cantdo and one of them is song composition or even poetry i strictly a prose kind of girl also i like hagrid but i cantdo his speech pattern very well in fact i cantvary my speech patterns very well by the way the search for the beta reader continues i also late in getting back to people because i had schoolwork to do anyway i must also confess that i a few chapters ahead if i had a beta reader they would go up faster com disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty breakfast at the grangers ginny had watched her brothers as they continued to watch jared closely she and ron had agreed that they wouldnttell anyone else about percy fate she had received no reply from him and actually went as far as to ask some of the other members of the order who worked at the ministry if they had seen him it was most peculiar that someone would ask after all things had had happened while she and ron were in school the older weasley brothers knew as well as their parents percy had indeed gone missing for a few months but was currently away no one spoke of it but it cause a great amount of anxiety for their mother ron was too concerned with jared to even notice if anything jared served as a welcome distraction to his grandparents even if they didntknow his true identity molly continually gushed about his good manners as arthur talked to him about all things muggle jared knowledge of the muggle world was vast and included things that had yet to be invented both of them felt terrible about jared being unable to go home to be with his parents during the holidays but jared tried to assure them that he was fine little did they know that jared was a veteran of several weasley christmases it wasntuntil the following day did molly brought up hermione again it such a shame that she cantbe with us said molly over breakfast ron shifted uncomfortably jared was sitting directly across from him i hope that she safe with her parents i was thinking of dropping by muggle london actually announced jared without looking at ron who nearly choked on his eggs i ve never been there and i would like to take some pictures to show my muggle grandparents when i get back home i d also like to pick up some thing for my mum what about your dad asked arthur jared shook his head as he finally glanced at ron ron right about that you know he doesntreally need anything i still would like to go into muggle london i really dontneed a chaperone i can get a hold of a map and just go around molly shook her head you arent with your parents here and i doubt that your father and mother would let you wander around a foreign country unsupervised one of the twins snickered at this statement but it was hard to say which one did it what do your parents do for a living jared asked arthur with some curiosity my father is an auror and my mother is a healer replied jared promptly if there one thing that i know how to do is go through places without much help my father is a pureblood actually he didntsay that earlier he comes from a pretty big family so i have a huge extended one i kind of like the fact that i donthave to share my mother parents with anyone else i their only grandchild that explains why you re spoiled rotten muttered ron under his breath jared glared at him for a second as arthur started laughing why dontyou come along ron challenged jared you haventreally seen muggle london have you what are you afraid of oh he good murmured either fred or george ron glared at both of them because he couldnttell who said that last statement they both wore identical grins jared went on besides hermione in muggle london with her parents have you ever been to a muggle house harry aunt house said ron that doesntcount said jared i mean a wizard friendly muggle house in fact i have the address he pulled out the address book out of his pocket he didntsay that hermione had given him the address and she hadn t harry you want to come along too you haventreally gotten a chance to take a look around before either that is if it safe enough for you i d like to come along agreed harry i dontthink that there would be death eaters hiding themselves among the muggles it ll be like hiding in plain sight molly gave a look to arthur that expressed her immediate anxiety about harry going off into the muggle world she already had that look when jared was trying to get ron to go now she was trying to get arthur to help her i sure that jared will be fine traveling in london said arthur evenly but if you are going to take others with you i think that you should have someone along jared was about ready to roll his eyes at them but he wouldntdare do that to them he glanced at ron to help him out but he had forgotten that neither arthur nor molly were aware of who jared really was if you really want to go to muggle london i could go with them volunteered bill quietly all eyes were on him as he continued to cut his sausage into bite sized pieces he took a swig of pumpkin juice before he said i ve got some time on my hands and i have to go to diagon alley to go to the bank anyway so i dontmind taking them out you want to come along ginny asked jared he hadntforgotten about her she seemed distracted though ginny snapping out of her haze ginny replied with a nod then we d better get moving after breakfast the twins had gone off to their shop at the same time as arthur charlie had left before the family had had breakfast he and molly typically had breakfast together before he went off to the dragon reserve bill ron harry ginny and jared set off for the muggle world after molly gave them all stern warnings as soon as they were out the door jared breathed a sigh of relief as he glanced at bill thanks for telling her you d go with us he said not a problem you know how she like pointed bill too bad your father couldnthave been more effective ron glared at him and jared i still a kid it not like mum would have let me go out anyway and if she knew who jared was she d definitely not let him go out and dad would have agreed with her he right agreed ginny harry had selected not to say anything at the moment he was surrounded by two generations of weasleys jared didntsay anything either but he sped up to walk with harry leaving the arguing between the others harry you know that you ll be all right you ll be the best godfather in the world said jared softly with a smile this made harry pause and think for a moment he thought about it and almost let out a sigh of relief that was true harry was going to live long enough to see jared grow up come to think of it ever since harry had found out who jared really was he didntspend a lot of time worrying if he was going to die in the next minute or so for the first time in a long time he was thinking of the future in more general terms but his thoughts fell on someone else briefly did i ever tell you about sirius black asked harry in a quiet voice the other weasleys had stopped their mild bickering when they heard the words out of harry mouth he hadntreally talked about sirius at all since the previous summer jared sighed and gave a short nod i hear about him more from uncle moony than from you sometimes you get more extreme than mum or dad sometimes you dontlet me do things you always tell me to think before leaping he gave a sheepish grin as he ran his fingers through his hair uncle moony said it because of what happened to sirius black he was your godfather and after i was born you swore that you d do whatever it took to keep my safe and to make sure that you d be around to do it harry didntsay anything as jared glanced at him he went on you used to be an auror but you quit after a while it wasnteasy being one for you you were too famous and they had a tendency to you more as a spokesperson than anything it was very frustrating that why you quit the headmistress offered you a position at hogwarts and you took it immediately you only started the year that i started bill hadntheard much about the future of hogwarts so glance at his siblings who werentsaying anything gryffindor was without a head of house you were given the position upon taking your place as the dada professor i was glad i wasntreally looking forward to school i had been home schooled by my mum most of the time before i started in hogwarts i was scared why would you be afraid of going to school asked ginny i mean you re a granger too i thought grangers loved school jared jaw clutched a bit i had a bad first experience in preschool it was one of those exclusive schools where all the wizarding children came from pureblood families i wasntwell received i did get an education for the one day that i was there there was something flat in his tone as if he didntwant to continue he turned his head slightly to look at ron it was a long time ago maybe it wasn t said harry picking up on jared tone you were pretty defensive when you asked about your heritage jared nostrils flared a bit i was just four they said i was a mudblood ginny remembered him saying something about that that wasntthe worst of it they called my mother that too ron jaw had clutched at that moment as his hand rolled into fists brats he muttered they said that you were a blood traitor added jared without glancing back at ron i didntknow what that was at the time i just knew that it was something bad no one wanted to play with me because my father was a blood traitor not because my mother was a muggle born witch but like i said it was a long time ago i know that you re not a blood traitor you re my dad and i wouldntbe here if you didntgo with your heart just dontget mad like mum always says it a waste of energy you should prove that you re better than them ron didntsoften up much he glanced at bill and ginny they wore identical looks of anger ron unclenched his fists and raised up his arm and placed it around jared shoulders you re right about me being afraid of going into the muggle world and i sort of envy how you harry and hermione can go back and forth between this world and other as far as i concerned you represent the best of both worlds after all you re made from the best stuff jared gave his father a smile thanks hermione woke up the following morning not feeling refreshed at all she had kept the curtain drawn from the previous night she got up and slowly opened them to let in some sunlight it was cloudy instead sighing she decided to get ready for the day after that she came down for breakfast to find that her mother had left to go early while her father remained behind michael granger was never a great cook but he did have one specialty pancakes he could make all kinds and he already had his daughter favorites waiting for her on the table good morning love did you have a good sleep he greeted cheerfully not really confessed hermione her father gave her a concerned look as he poured her a glass of orange juice dad do ravens come out during winter well most birds migrate south answered michael why hermione shook her head it okay no you can tell me even if it about magic i know that you re worried that your mother and i wontunderstand but you know that we re trying about that hermione paused as she looked at her father sometimes i think that mum wants me to be something i not i think she disappointed or something i didntgo to the same school that she went to the one that you were planning on sending me before and i not going to be a dentist dad i donteven want a debut or anything when i eighteen i dont even know what i want to do as a career michael gently tipped her chin up to look at him as he smiled at her tenderly you arenta disappointment hermione you re everything you have to be you re you i know that your mother seems like she getting really pushy about these things but that really your grandmother getting to her you remember that when you have a child someday have you been talking to mum about that i only sixteen dad i not going to have a child of my own anytime soon in fact i dontthink i ll even get married unless you want me to have a child without getting married let not talk about that option hermione laughed at the expression on her father face he didntlook at all happy at the prospect of anyone marrying his daughter but he did look forward to the one good thing that might come out of it which was having grandchildren there came a knock at the door at the same time a smell from the stove dad um yeah i sort of forgot said michael sheepishly as he rushed to the stove go see who at the door hermione got up and put her napkin down next to her plate probably the fire department the neighbors must have noticed the smoke she went to go answer the door she was utterly surprised and jared greeted her with a smile jared what are you doing here i was in the neighborhood and decided to drop by he answered are you going to let me in or what hermione who is it asked her father as he walked into the living room hello and you are hello dr granger my name is jared blake i the american foreign exchange student attending hermoine school answered jared he held out his hand and shook hands with michael i thought you were staying with ron and harry said hermione numbly michael was having a different reaction to jared the first thing he noticed were jared eyes they were identical to hermione s but more importantly they were the same as viola s he also thought of blake the name of his in laws i was but i decided that i just had to go to london said jared how did you find out where i live asked hermione ginny gave me the address answered jared michael smiled and said why dontyou come in hermione where are your manners you re just going to leave him out here look at him dad he not a homeless waif michael ignored hermione come on in jared did you have breakfast yet i did answered jared as the door was closed behind him but i do smell pancakes are you having pancakes michael laughed yes we most certainly are you look like a growing lad would you like to have some jared would never turn down a stack of his papa pancakes he almost called michael that at the door he nodded well then have a seat hermione took her seat at her side of the table jared automatically took the seat right next to hers not because there was a chair that was simply there but out of habit they had to sit down and wait for hermione father to come back so where are ron and harry they went to the bank with bill and ginny answered jared now he really wasnttelling the truth they were outside because ron didntreally want to go inside so the others agreed to stay with him jared wasnt supposed to stay for too long but he couldntturn down his grandfather pancakes so what are you up to what kind of muggle thing are you going to do be doing i going to go to that ball that i told you about answered hermione jared nodded i know that you really dontwant to go formal affairs dont seem like your thing maybe you should just tell your mother that you really dontwant to go it doesntwork that way my mother gets her way on this because my grandmother will never let her hear the end of it i might as well go and get it over with i hope that you re having fun with the weasleys i was welcomed with open arms reported jared with a smile that was as irresistible as his father s here you go said michael as he set down a stack of pancakes in front of jared and took his place at the table with a stack of his own so you re a classmate of hermione s i didntknow that your school had an exchange program neither did i admitted hermione as she glanced at jared who wasnt talking as he was eating the pancakes looking extremely happy with himself he seemed to be enjoying them immensely so are you sending presents home to your parents not quite answered jared after swallowing a bite this is great dr granger thanks said michael there was something about this young man that he liked but he couldntquite put a finger on it maybe it was his warm brown eyes michael had steely blue ones in contrasts to his dark hair the boy sitting across from him had the same coloring as michael wife and daughter so i take it that your parents are muggles too no dr granger answered jared politely it was odd to refer to his grandfather by such a formal title but his mother always told him to show manners to people but my mother is a muggle born witch so i spend a lot of time with my muggle grandparents michael kind of breathed a sigh of relief so it can be done what do you mean dad asked hermione michael smiled softly at her it was the smile that he reserved for her and would later use on his grandson well you re different from everyone else that your mother and i know i guess that why we were kind of worried about you being a witch it wasntthe magic but the fact that it a different culture and society your mother and i talked about it a lot as you get older you re supposed to spend time with your friends but you re in a place where your mother and i cantreally be in and you re worried if i had any kids you wontbe able to see them as much asked hermione jared busied himself with the pancakes while they were talking he didnthave the heart to correct her on that the word kids she wasntgoing to have more than one just like her own mother he finished the stack while they were talking thank you for the excellent breakfast he told michael who seemed to beam at him would you like more no thanks i had breakfast with the weasleys michael looked at him with a raised eyebrow so you also know ron and harry jared nodded i staying with them but i like i said i wanted to go to london he was licking his lips to get the last of the syrup i was wondering if hermione wanted to go show me around that is if she has the time he glanced at her i do have some time before the ball it doesntstart until seven said hermione as she looked at her father i guess we could go out to london i have to be at the office though i have an appointment to do some work on a patient said michael i sure that hermione wontget lost just dontget into any trouble while you re in london okay dad said hermione as she got up i need to grab my bag and i ll come back down jared nodded as he picked up his dishes and grabbed hers he walked to the sink with them out of habit michael stared at him as he walked away shaking his head michael picked up his plate and followed suit why didntyou just go inside with him asked ginny impatiently it not like you re a stranger you re going to marry her and you re his father stop talking moaned ron as he shook his head her parents are in there or at least her dad you werentthere last summer when he was glaring at me bill laughed as he looked at harry who gave a slight nod so the man already suspicious of you he must have an inkling that you re the one who going to take his daughter away from him ron cheeks were bright red at the moment he almost said something but they saw the door swing open as michael granger came outside if ron could use one word to describe hermione father it would be imposing by the time ron was done growing he was only a few inches taller than michael they both had blue eyes but somehow jared ended up with hermione s michael as viola put it was resembled a real life james bond ron spent the first few years of his marriage to hermione in fear of his father in law it wasntuntil they decided to bond together against a common enemy did they start getting along have a good day said michael as he kissed hermione on her forehead and come back by four your mother will expect you to be here and to get ready to the ball look donttry to get out of it you know that i ll be blamed for it yes dad besides i wouldntabandon you to the vultures hermione assured him have a good day at work i ll see you at four it was nice meeting you dr granger said jared with a nod and a wave michael held out his hand and shook hands with jared it was a pleasure meeting you as well jared as soon as michael drove off hermione and jared started walking down the street so what are you really doing here in london she asked with the others trailing behind them what do you mean i supposed to pick up a present for my mother replied jared innocently hermione gave him a look that made him slightly uncomfortable she started giving him that look when he started to exhibit some of his more weasley mischief causing tendencies at the tender age of two he did what he always did when she gave him that look he gave her a smile you know come to think of it i need your help picking out something for harry and ron um okay said jared reluctantly look i dontknow what they really want and i supposed to go to diagon alley to meet up with them that perfect i wanted to get something for harry there what about ron that why i need your help hermione smiled at him as she grabbed his arm jared knew he wasntgoing to like this an the beginning is tied to the next story the story after this one takes place at the same time as this one does however by christmas time next story has been concluded there is something to be said about taking the time to write these stories and having them posted one after the other it allows me to construct things more fluidly i have been out for a little bit due to some personal and family issues thank you for your understanding disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty one shopping i knew you were the same size as ron commented hermione as she looked at jared in the mirror are we done yet whined jared i tired of this and i not here to be your living mannequin nearby the others were having a good laugh at jared expense ron shook his head from time to time at the things that hermione had been putting on jared currently he was in a leather jacket you sound like ron observed hermione in fact you complain like him jared glared at her i dont think this will do something else take that off jared cursed under his breath and peeled off the jacket he was wearing a pair of jeans and a long sleeve shirt with a thermal underneath he had his time turner hidden under that i not doing this anymore i dontcare i out of here just one more cajoled hermione one come on jared gave her a pained look as he submitted himself to another jacket this time it was a denim one this looks great how does it feel on your shoulders it fine but you might one to get one that a size bigger answered jared he was really hoping to avoid going on a shopping trip that involved trying on clothes just one shopping trip with hermione without having to try on clothes you think so yes because ron still growing you re right hermione nodded in agreement as went to go find a larger size just one more i promise i need to see how it would look jared sighed and put on the jacket it does look good we re done marvelous muttered jared as he took off the jacket and handed off to her now while you go and pay i need to pick up something for my mother he separated from her as she grimaced and went to a long line to pay for the jacket jared said i ll meet you outside the store when you re done all right agreed hermione jared walked around the corner and caught up with the others he looked at ron and said i guess your present not going to be a surprise and you should be happy because it going to fit i feel so used yeah but it was pretty funny said ginny with a giggle you re so cute sometimes jared donttouch me he said as she reached out for his cheek i not here for your amusement and i not cute we should get something for hermione muttered ron great i dontknow what to get her he looked at jared dontlook at me i dontknow what you should get her ron raised an eyebrow at him she your mother jared shrugged i know you d think after spending nearly nine months inside someone you d think that i would know what she d like but you ve known her longer than me you two are hopeless muttered ginny you know the more i see you two together the more it obvious that you two are related added bill at least you were told ahead of time i have no idea how hermione going to react if she finds out said harry why dontyou go and get what you were going to get it her jared we have to go to the bookstore answered jared it just across the street let go i wanted to get her a book that sounds easy enough said ron ginny clamped her hand on ron shoulder and stopped him in the name that is all good please dont get her a book ron you were doing so well you got her that perfume before that means that you must get her something along those lines getting her a book is like going backwards ron argued but jared getting her a book you re different said harry jared suppose to be a friend at least that how hermione supposed to see him and you re supposed to be more than a friend she picking out clothes for you actually she pretty much picks out our clothes said jared as they entered the bookstore he went straight for the book that hermione would like bill smiled suddenly it was the type of smile that one had when one had a brilliant idea i think it not just the gift but the way you give it to her that will count where are they holding this ball jared um at the blake estate at least that where i think it being held answered jared with a confused look i ll be back i have to pay for this what are you talking about bill asked ron truly perplexed he stared at his brother tonight is the night of this grand muggle ball and it doesntlook like she too keen on going pointed out bill maybe you can pay a visit over there you donthave to take her away from the ball but you can at least see her i donthave anything to wear said ron nothing really what about those robes that fred and george gave you said harry they maybe wizarding dress robes but they re good enough to pass as muggle clothes you should see some of the wilder muggle fashions he picked up a random magazine and flipped a few pages it was a magazine about muggle celebrities he showed them the pictures which elicited a laugh from the weasleys jared came back with a bag i ve got it so what are you going to get her he asked ron i have an idea said ron soon after they split up and jared returned to hermione before they left they had made plans to meet back in diagon alley in about an hour jared met up with hermione and made it look like nothing happened he told hermione about his meeting with the others okay but we can get there early i still have to pick up presents for the others hermione told him jared gave her a sidelong glance why did you get ron the only gift from here she gave him a slight smile but wouldnt give him an answer as they continued to walk along for some odd reason hermione felt safe being out and about in the muggle world with jared at her side there was something comforting about his presence safety was an illusion as they walked together they were in danger without the person who was the most capable of protecting them both at their side hermione played around with the idea of telling jared about seeing the raven but she remembered ron saying before that he couldntbe trusted she didntknow that ron trusted him now harry and the weasleys were in diagon alley looking through fred and george shop they were retelling what had happened that morning as they set up a plan to help ron around molly the twins were experts on it and it was best to leave this kind of planning to the professionals jared had given the address of the blake estate which was right in london it was one of those estates that had its own private park making it seem enclosed in such a large city harry had taken the liberty of buying a map of the city and located the estate on it they made some preliminary plans and later would ask jared input on the scheme the trouble isnthow you re going to get there noted fred it trying to get out from under mum it one thing to ask to leave during broad daylight but it another trying to get out at night george added i dontthink harry will be able to go out either neither will jared none of you will be able to leave mum will say no we know that said ron i knew this was a bad idea bill but we can leave said bill the adults can come and go as well please i say we weasley brothers just go out on the town no offense to you ginny but i doubt that you mum will let you go either i understand said ginny with a sigh i swear i cantwait till i an adult so i can do as i please even when you re adult you cantdo as you please said bill you are going to have to do a lot of things that you still dontwant to do sorry to break it to you but that just how things are he gave her a gentle smile ginny sighed i thought so but i guess i could help out by convincing mum she going to be the brick wall you ll have to go through you re going to need all the help you can get ron this is going to be great this is the first mass joint operation that the weasley kids have ever done said fred proudly with some assistance from harry of course but he practically a member of the family all of us will be helping out all of us echoed ginny as she shook her head percy not here her brothers looked at her the twins were rather stern as bill said and he wouldntapprove of it anyway but there was something else about the looks on their faces it spoke silently for them neither harry nor ginny really knew why something had had happened during the time that they were in school ginny folded her arms over her chest and pressed her lips together her older brothers didntknow the information that she knew but harry did he was going along with what harry and jared said about not trying to change something that is obviously going to happen so both sides held information that neither was going to find out george broke the tension as he looked out the window they re coming in we ll have to finish planning this later jared opened the door for hermione letting her in first and followed he looked around the shop it was larger than the one in hogsmeade but it would later on expand even more so he was already distracted by one of the displays hermione greeted them with a smile she walked up to them and greeted it great to see all of you i ran into jared in london he was where d he go jared what are you doing jared snapped to attention and said defensively i was just looking i wasntgoing to buy anything hermione gave him a perplexing look you were right behind me and then you were gone and why would i care if you bought anything or not as long as you dontuse anything on me i dontcare now that was completely the opposite from what jared had heard from her before on his third year at hogwarts she made him promise her that he wouldntbuy one more prank from any shop really i dontcare ron sensed that jared was getting anyway with something it was jared eagerness and he had to stop jared dontdo it he said warningly keep walking jared looked like he wanted to pout but went i never get what i want muttered jared in a low voice ron shrugged the others laughed but hermione stopped short i make it my life to stop you from getting what you want countered ron amidst the laughter jared scowled at him leave him alone ron said hermione with some exasperation the weasleys looked at each other most of them would have argued that very few people would have any luck controlling ron completely without him complaining excessively but it seemed that hermione was the only one who could pull it off that didntmean they wouldnt argue about it later jared had a smug look on his face when ron stopped so everyone is getting ready for christmas i wanted to she glanced at the clock on the wall is that the right time fred and george turned and looked at it they turned back and nodded hermione shook her head i going to be late i have to go i ll see you all later i ll just owl your gifts sorry with that she was out the door jared glanced at the clock oh yeah she has to be home by four good we need you to help us said bill come along jared jared raised his eyebrow at him but went along anyway hermione sighed again as she stared at herself in front of the mirror in less than half an hour she was going to be at her grandmother house and be around a bunch of people she didntknow nor did she want to know she would have preferred to stay home with her parents or go see her friends she dreaded going out to see the people at the party because she knew she wouldntbe able to relate to them the more she thought about it the more she dreaded it but she couldnttake back the promise she had made to her father there came a soft knock on the door and hermione went to go and answer it she opened it and her father was standing there wearing his tuxedo hermione help me with this thing he told her referring to his bowtie hermione shook her head and smiled as she tied it for him dad why didntyou ever learn how to tie it i was never forced to learn you know that your mother has been taking care of things like this for me for years answered michael with a laugh i would have asked her but she was too frazzled by your grandmother you should see her cell phone call list the top calls of the day are from your grandmother hermione shook her head again this isntthe middle ages dad i feel like she setting me up to marry me off her father gave her assuring smile dontworry about it sweetheart no one will marry you without getting through me first he told her as he kissed her forehead thank you for tying this hermione gave him a bright smile now that more like it so how did it go with jared we ended up going to diagon alley but we ran out of time i had to come back here to get ready answered hermione her hair was done in an elegant up twist do she felt a little bare n the dress that she was wearing but she also felt somewhat innocent he wontbe around next year i suppose but he fun to be around hmm said michael there something oddly familiar about that boy i was thinking that but i cantquite figure out why admitted hermione but i glad you like him too bad harry and ron couldnthave made it they were in diagon alley michael slightly raised his eyebrow at that so you saw them at diagon alley hermione nodded what did they say there wasntenough time dad i had to come back here she repeated as she gave him a quizzical look why are you so suspicious it not my fault that i donthave any girlfriends my best friends just happen to be boys if i know anything it the mind of a teenage boy muttered michael just because you happen to be friends with them doesntmean you know what goes on in their heads you didntseem to have a problem with jared while he was here and in case you didntnotice dad he was a boy exclaimed hermione i cant believe you why are you being like this i go to bordering school already i have to go there to get my education but i would like to go home and just be with you and mum without any problems i dontlike you bugging me about my friends michael gave her an exasperated look she looked very much like her mother but that burst of temper was from him hermione was pacing up and down barefooted her sequined shoes were lying on the floor upturned she folded her arms over her chest and sighed michael expression changed from exasperated from to surprise when did she start looking so much like her mother when did she grow up so fast hermione wasntthe same little girl who used to ask him to carry her all the time it was then that he realized that he wasntgoing to lose her because she was a witch he was going to lose her because she was growing up someday when you have your own child you will understand michael told her calmly you ll want to protect him or her from anything or anyone you perceive as a threat that when you ll understand why i seem crazy to you they re my friends said hermione in a soft voice and just because they re boys doesntmean that they re going to do anything to me if anything they treat me like a boy she laughed but it wasntone of mirth it took four years for ron to realize i was a girl four years the hurt in her voice was something that only her father could hear that was more than a year ago if ron didntnotice before he sure did now that was michael personal observations it was during the summer ron and his brothers and sister arranged to meet hermione before the school year started to pick up supplies early michael had gone off with his wife and arthur and molly to go and have a bite at the leaky cauldron but before that michael witness as ron and hermione talked to each other with their heads together there was definitely something there even if the two of them didntnotice or denied it i sorry muttered michael michael hermione are you ready to get going called viola from the hall we need to get there early mum sent a car for us i need to put on my shoes called back hermione as she tipped her shoes upwards and slid her feet in i see we re not driving to the festivities did nana say that your cars werentnice enough again no answered michael as he gave an admiring look you look beautiful just like your mother thanks dad said hermione with a smile that lit up the whole room they left her room her mother was waiting for them downstairs they had to get into the car okay i think i know why she sent the car she whispered to her father she wants to make sure we cantrun off you ve got in one dear an hermione thinks that fred and george are a bad influence on jared and she right almost all their nieces and nephews adore them hermione has a tendency to be treated as one of the boys from time to time it might be easy for ron and harry to do that but her father bound to notice what have the weasleys planned next chapter i wonder why wontlet me do a line break and divide the scenes like i normally do this is staring to irritate me kirikarin i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty two grandmother ball the house of helena blake was one of the biggest private homes in london she was considered part of the upper crust of london society her family was one of the oldest and proudest families in all of england as well as her husband s the father of viola when she was less than forty years old her husband passed away since that time she had had been married and divorced three times her only child was viola making hermione her only grandchild by the old tradition dating back a couple of generations all the females in the family were named after women from shakespearean works helena was a proud woman who sought to have only the best in her family but the trick was it had to be based on her standards she disapproved of the fact that hermione didntattend the same all girls school that many of the women of their family had attended before she blamed michael for it in fact she blamed michael for a lot of things helena still accused him of seducing viola away from the family the only bright spot that came out of michael and viola getting married was hermione as far as helena was concern however the whole business of sending hermione off to an exclusive boarding school irritated helena to no end it was her own personal requirement that every decision in the family had to go through her first and she wondered why her daughter didnt visit or have tea with her that often in the future she wouldntshow as much hostility towards ron but she still would make him dislike her intensely she never called michael and ron by their names she would be the doting great grandmother to jared hermione dear you look wonderful exclaimed helena as she surveyed her granddaughter it been ages since i ve seen you and you re growing up quite beautifully she bestowed two kisses on the cheek the kind that where lips never touch viola you look wonderful as well went on helena she turned her head to look at her son in law you look all right matthew michael gritted his teeth to keep from saying something utterly unpleasant but his wife had a hold of his hand she gave him a gentle squeeze to remind him that she was there so michael swallowed his words and gave a stiff nod instead how he wanted to put the woman in her place after all the pleasantries were exchanged the grangers moved along as the night went on it became increasingly evident that her grandmother was showing her off to show the rest of the world that hermione was growing up and was still a member of the blake family needless to say hermione was looking for the nearest exit unfortunately for her they were blocked things were going well enough at the headquarters of the order ginny and harry were situated in the living room while fred and george were making quite a mess in the kitchen they had volunteered to make dinner that night much to the cringe of their mother she was harry and ginny in the living room ron jared bill and charlie were upstairs each time something crashed in the kitchen molly looked like she was going to get up and take over at that very moment ginny and harry were watching each and very reaction she was making to the noise you know i just hope none of us gets sick from this said ginny quietly i wouldntknow i didntthink fred and george could cook said harry with a shrug ginny gave him a very serious look and muttered they can t just as she said that there came another crash and she winched harry looked at her slightly wide eyed the others choose that moment to come trooping down the stairs what was that asked bill your brothers are trying to cook dinner answered molly she got to her feet and was about to go towards the kitchen when she noticed that the four who had come down the stairs were wearing their coats ready to go out where are you going i have to go and put this in the post office said jared holding up a parcel it for my muggle grandparents it already late i going to get in trouble with my mother for forgetting them he was pretty sure that molly didntknow that the post offices were already closed for the holiday it was a good thing that arthur was gone on official ministry business that would keep him from home for a bit we ll go with him volunteered charlie and if you want mum we ll pick up some extra food you know something edible do you need money asked molly she was almost cut off by the sound of another pot i donthave any muggle cash on me i think your father has some dontworry about it said bill i ve got some okay let go before the post office closes yeah agreed ron it was noticeable that he was wearing a longer coat than the others molly would have noticed that he was wearing some nice shoes if she wasntso distracted by what the twins were doing they chorused as they went out the door see you later molly didnteven have time to say goodbye as one of the twins shouted i cantbelieve you did that to me me she rushed to the kitchen as the smoke started coming from under the door as soon as she was out the room harry said quietly phase one is complete ginny smiled hermione was getting pretty tired of each boy in her age group coming up to her asking her to dance she was also tired of listening to the other girls discussing the latest of everything the latest style the latest movie the latest heartthrob hermione was tired of all the pretentious people and wanted nothing to do with them she had no business being in this part of the muggle world she was too much like her father from time to time she glanced over to her father was trying to hold his own against some of those people sure he made a lot of money as a dentist but he was from a working class family he knew better than to spend his money on things that he didntneed for one thing he hated playing golf unlike most of the men at the party who lived and breathed the courses he preferred playing pool billiards darts and football having done all of that in his youth so you re the granddaughter of helena blake where has she been hiding you asked one of the more boring self absorbed boys hermione wanted to roll her eyes but her good upbringing stopped her from doing so i ve been going to a boarding school replied hermione you know the type that far far away from here just like she wanted to be right that second as she had a cup made of cut crystal that was full of punch her hand she wanted to pour it over the pompous moron head once again she restrained herself you know you re very important here you re the only grandchild of mrs blake pointed out the boy this estate is huge so are the assets i wouldntknow i dontcare for this sort of things said hermione blandly it just money if it mattered to me at all i d be doing everything that my grandmother wanted me to do and exactly the way that she d want it done too the boy leaned in forward that is such a turn on he murmured he leaned in even closer and started to whisper things to her with growing disgust that turned into rage hermione listened to what the prick had to say that was enough in less than a minute he was covered in punch and his foot was throbbing from where hermione had stomped on it she stalked off to get away from him if you even think of coming near me again you ll really be sorry she warned him without turning to look at him hermione jane granger shouted her grandmother with horror from across the room obviously she had been talking to the boy father who wore a look of shock and then anger you apologize right now that behavior is absolutely uncalled for hermione didnthear any of it she just kept walking pushing her way through as many people while maintaining some of her dignity she was nearly in tears at that point she was angry and frustrated her mother was going to be mad at her later she was ready to scream at anyone else who got in her way finally she managed to push her way through one of the doors into the backyard the reason why no one was going outside was because it was snowing on and off everyone stayed inside to keep warm she just wanted to get away she didntcare that she didnthave a coat or anything else she just wanted out she was just out the door when she was collided with someone else who was on his way in out of my way she exclaimed angrily as she pushed on his chest with all her might but the person in front of her was almost immovable after the she had first ran into him he had dug his heels into the snow and prepared himself to be pushed you re not going to get far with that dress hermione it too cold he told her hermione was shocked as she finally looked up her eyes widened as she started to smile he was sort of surprised to find her so easily and wearing that dress it took longer than a minute for them to release that ron was still holding her when they both realized it they both pulled away from each other at the same time ron forced himself to recover first as he cleared his throat nervously so why are you so mad why are you asking because normally i the one who makes you mad hermione laughed you re not the only one who makes me mad you just do it more often anyone else it just that the ball isntany fun at all for me i dontfit in with anyone there except for my parents to tell you the truth i ve been dreading this thing and it worst than i even imagined she started to rub her arms ron draped his coat on her shoulders without her saying anything she looked at him with some surprise again the snow flakes were slowly drifting onto his shoulders he was wearing a set of dress robes that she had never seen before it looked like it had been tailored for him the shade was wonderful and from what she could tell when she had ran into him it was soft the coat on her shoulders was still warm from his body are you sure she asked him referring to the coat yeah said ron as he glanced at her she was beautiful with the snow gently falling she brushed away a flake that had fallen on her eyelashes she reached out to brush another one away but he had gotten there first now why are you running out in the snow in almost nothing you looked pretty upset for a second there my grandmother sighed hermione she always trying to make me something that i dontwant to be my mum can be just as bad but she not always like that she tries to stop herself or my dad will stop her my grandmother will never change i sometimes dontfeel like her granddaughter i feel like something that she owns i doubt anyone can do that to anyone said ron and even then you d be the last person to belong to anyone unless you want to that is what are you doing here ron asked hermione i know that it not exactly christmas eve yet but i surprised to see you here jared had a few errands to run he had to mail something off to his grandparents so bill charlie and i went along but i figured that i d drop by to see you you ve seen me at my home loads of times i just wanted to see you at some place that was like that although at the point it doesntlook like it why dontwe go someplace warmer suggested hermione i ll sneak you in the party planner going to have a fit if someone comes in with an invitation besides i dontwant to go back right now and your dad here muttered ron hermione looked at him funny and shook her head as she took his hand they both went inside as three other people lingered outside in the snow jared glanced at his uncles as they kind of stepped off i think that it let go get some food i starving what about your parents asked charlie i d rather not watch if it all the same to you answered jared as he wrinkled his nose a bit it was one of the few gestures that he picked up from his mother why dontwe go and get the food already ron knows where to meet us again when he finished but neither of you have any idea of where you need to go you re just like your father a bit prudish when it comes to this stuff tell me do you have a girlfriend pressed bill jared shook his head i like being footloose and fancy free look my dad maybe okay with my mum as she is because he needs her to boss him around a bit but i my own man bill noticed the scar that was running along the neck of jared where d you get that jared rolled his eyes a bit and said not you too dad already asked me about it and i dontremember okay all right said charlie as he glanced at bill let go get some food ron only has so much time and so do we ron could feel the warmth of hermione hand as she led him through the dark hallways of the house he could barely see in the darkness they paused from time to time as they saw parts of the party on going they had to duck in corners to avoid being seen along the way hermione explained what she had done earlier and ron couldnthelp it but smile she couldntsee it though they continued until they exited out again it was the front yard of the house ron had told hermione that he was supposed to meet back with his brothers on the other side he made no mention of jared ron had to be careful about drawing comparisons between himself and jared so what are you really doing here asked hermione as she folded her arms over her chest they were standing closer to the doorway and closer together to keep warm you didntsound too happy answered ron today and things are a little too boring at home harry still not really talking much you have better luck getting through to him sometimes than i do hermione hermione gave him a soft smile as she gazed up at him normally she couldntquite reach his face with hers but with the heels she was able to if she just tipped her chin upwards a bit he would have to meet her part way still but at least she was tall enough not to make it hard for him she turned her chin upwards to look at him more directly ron looked down at her startled at how close she was he wanted to reach down and touch her but he held himself back she could hear what he was saying loud and clear he came because he did want to be with her but he was still filled with excuses the excuses were a symptom of his doubt ron i was wondering about something she whispered she decided to find something to talk about to fill in the silence hmm have you seen that raven out and about ron expression changed from relaxed to startled in a heartbeat why have you seen it i think i did where when at my house last night ron pulled back from her a bit with a drawing expression he realized what he had been missing all along an animagus he whispered he an animagus who asked hermione as her brows furrowed who are you talking about ron he knows where you live went on ron ignoring her questions we have to get you out of here what going on ron demanded hermione i not going anywhere until you tell me what this is all about ron are you listening to me ron was in deep thought for a moment as he looked around at the trees surely he could spot a raven in a sea of white but the tree tops were too high up and they disappeared into the darkness he reached his hand out and grabbed hers do you even have your wand on you hermione shook her head ron bit down a sarcastic comment about being careless but he needed her to cooperate with him i ve got mine he knew that he just left himself and hermione expose to magus he put his other hand in his pocket to get a hold of his wand he looked around again we have to get back inside he said why ron you still haventtold me anything said hermione as she crossed her arms over her chest and stood firm she looked scared at that moment because he wasntanswering any of her questions his next action surprised even more he lowered his head more and pressed his lips against hers trust me he whispered as he pulled back you know i wouldnt let anything happen to you we have to leave now we ll explain it to your parents later hermione was too shocked by ron kiss to say anything else he was now the one holding her hand and guiding her she didnteven have time to really think of how warm and soft his lips were the next thing she knew they were running away from her grandmother house jared bill and charlie continued down the path towards the restaurant that jared knew about the air was very cold and jared had put his coat collar up to stop them from staring at it he walked a couple of paces ahead of them as well neither of them asked about it further jared saw a pond that was froze over he stopped suddenly it seemed that he was frozen in place jared said bill as he and charlie caught up to him jared are you all right jared shook his head as he yanked down the collar of his coat he ran his finger against the scar a couple of times i remember now my parents and i were just at the burrow with my friends my friends and i went out just for a little bit it was the holiday after all and broad daylight nothing suppose to happen then his breathing was heaving charlie gave bill a frightened look you mean you ve been here before obviously that true said bill in a calming tone he could see fear i hate the water i afraid of water muttered jared i cantgo swimming in the lake at school he came out of no where separated me from my friends he pulled me under the water his eyes were focused on the lake jared snapped out of it whispered charlie as he tried to take a hold of jared hands he was obviously having an anxiety attack bill started to rub his back to snap him back into reality come on you re alive still we re no where near the water what going on why are all three of you out here asked hermione almost breathless ron had her hand in his his eyes were immediately on jared who was fighting for air jared are you all right stop that you re going to pass out jared suddenly jared body went slack bill and charlie had him by either arm preventing him from falling ron released hermione hand and shouldered himself under jared jared what wrong he glanced at bill and charlie what happened just now we didntdo anything explained bill quickly one minute we re walking by the frozen lake the next he was talking about how much he was afraid of the water it didntmake much sense to me charlie nodded in agreement but he was rubbing that scar on his neck i think we should take him home why is hermione out here the two oldest weasleys looked at their future sister in law in their brother coat self conscious hermione pulled the sides of ron coat closer to her body i cantexplain right now we need to get back to 12 grimmauld place answered ron as he took possession of hermione hand again it not safe out here an helena is one tough woman she one of those who mean well but she really doesntunderstand she sort of does what endora from bewitched does with darrin name which is never using the right one helena does it with both michael and ron jared does have his own fear just as ron is afraid of spiders jared is terrified of bodies of water he can take baths and whatnot but if it involves getting in a boat he cantdo it it is a logical fear as well disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty three a memory when jared opened his eyes he awoke to the sounds of molly fussing over him he was resting in a bed that was in one of the other guest rooms the weasleys didntwant to take up more room in the 12 grimmauld place than necessary but it was suggested that jared have a more quiet place to relax in molly pressed a warm towel against his forehead there there now dontget up yet she whispered soothingly jared moaned as he tried to shift his head away from her now you have to rest dontbe like that jared was embarrassed about what had happened why did he have to hyperventilate like that he passed out completely he didntwant her asking after the scar on his neck he remembered how he had gotten it in the first place he swallowed where ron he outside with the others answered molly as she rung out the towel you gave us all a fright i donteven know why hermione is even here ron didntsay anything i want to see m jared stopped and closed his eyes he almost ended up shouting that he wanted to see his dad after he swallowed again and refocused i want to see ron please molly looked at him for a moment she was about to say something else but she reached her hand out and caressed jared cheek i didntbelieve them when they told me i wondered where they had gone i ll go and tell your father that you re awake she whispered gently jared was too tired to ask how she found out or rather who told her in less than a minute ron entered the room and closed the door behind him he had changed out of his robes and was wearing jeans and a jumper he strode over to jared side are you all right asked ron anxiously i remember now i remember how i got this answered jared quietly as he ran his finger down the scar it was from a dagger a dagger asked ron as he pulled up a chair how jared sat up a bit but couldntquite pull himself up ron helped him up a little it was during the winter holiday on my third year did i explain to you what you really do as an auror what level you re at ron shook his head see after harry choose to leave the aurors and become a teacher you were offered another position a new division within the aurors was developed for violent crimes you were selected to head up this task force i mean by that time you had been an auror for nearly twenty years you started working as head of that task force when i started in hogwarts and mum decided to go back as a full time healer and i was the one who went after magus in the first place asked ron jared nodded i was the one who took him down but you didntknow how i did it in the first place you try to leave your work at work as much as possible confirmed jared you didntwant to worry mum or me when i was younger less than a year old there were various attacks on aurors families that spanned over a year you and mum decided that it would be safer to go some place safe i was six months old when we took shelter in greece harry was our secret keeper he was took off to travel on his own to australia the caribbean and the united states during that time nana and papa had to come with us because you and mum were worried they re just muggles it was like a year before we came back but everything turned out all right we came back to england and you continued working as an auror it wasntuntil you became head of the task force that when a series of unsolved murders of muggles part muggle wizards and purebloods who sympathized with them were found dead that was when magus entered your life jared took a deep breath as he looked at ron you were the only auror who figured out that all the murders were linked when magus found out about you he decided that you were the only one worthy of the game that he was playing for the next year three years capturing him consumed you mum got really worried about you you were getting more and more distant during that time i was away at school but even i noticed it later on it turned out that magus was taking pictures of mum at work and sending it to you at your offices he even took pictures of me at hogwarts over the first three years that i was there i think that why you were so consumed with it uncle harry was keeping an eye on me i wondered why he was pretty angry when he found me wandering out in the halls when i was too restless to sleep ron could see that jared found a memory of harry yelling at him very amusing the year before last if ron had to imagine harry yelling at a child he would have a hard time imagining it however harry was going to be a very protective godfather it came to a head just before christmas said jared i was out with my friends ari and alex we were going to just go out for a bit to have a snowball fight you know that huge pond that was out near the burrow it makes for a great place to have a snowball fight it got very foggy all of a sudden it was so thick that you could take a knife and cut a piece out of it i got separated from my friends at first i could hear them but i couldnthear them anymore after a while just like the forest murmured ron he remembered how hermione and he called out for the others i was all alone i didntknow that was on top of the pond continued jared suddenly i heard someone slam something on the ice i felt the ice give way under me and i sank into the water i was wearing heavy clothes to keep warm i couldntmove and i was sinking that when the fog cleared i saw him i saw magus standing over me jared was having some difficulty keep him breathing steady ron reached out and placed his hand on top of his he just pulled me out of the water i think that ari and alex ran back to the burrow to tell you what was happening because i could hear you shouting you told him to let me go magus had a dagger in his hand he tried to slit my throat but i managed to moved just enough so that he couldntget the blade deep enough he let me go into the water and i sank back in it hurt a lot and i was screaming my head off the water was so cold and i was losing blood i passed out the next thing i remember is that you were pounding on my chest to get the water out but it all hazy i think you carried me back home and mum had to look at it i ended up waking up in the hospital there were all kinds of tubes and stuff attached to me at the time i didnt remember what had happen and i had missed the first week back from school the most important thing was that magus had been brought in and was sentence to azkaban you dontknow how it happened asked ron as he got to his feet i dontunderstand why you would have to stay at the hospital for so long but i did figure out something magus is an animagus he can turn into a raven so that how he can make it like he appearing one moment and disappearing the next said jared actually the dagger was made out of an alloy it contained lots of iron and something else someone developed it and it was something that he used to kill the purebloods that he hated i had blood poisoning from it but being a half blood is what kept me alive he knew that mum was a muggleborn witch but even half bloods have a fifty fifty chance of survival if cut by that alloy and children are even more likely to die i had to continue taking potions to prevent a relapse for a year i hated going to madame pomfrey getting it too she d give me long lecture every time i was late and since i couldntremember what had happened i was pretty upset about not being able to play quidditch ron sighed and shook his head that would be enough for me not to let you play quidditch so when did you get to be on the team my fifth year answered jared but i was asking the year before that because a beater position had opened up last year the keeper position opened up and after a whole summer of asking over and over again mum got you to at least let me try out there was a pause as jared went on again i just didntremember what had happened until now my friends didntreally know either ari and alex said it was pretty scary that there was blood all over you and me but grandmum sent them out of the room before they could see anything it my fault something happened to you in the first place whispered ron you re lucky that hermione going to be a healer ron what did grandmum say she knows who i am asked jared suddenly did you tell hermione ron shook his head but his eyes widened hermione doesntknow i didnt say anything to her but my mum knows who told her maybe you re right no one in this family can keep a secret i just left her out there with them he got to his feet again this is getting to be too much magus was at the grangers house just yesterday evening jared eyes widened at that statement what are you going to do now i dontknow muttered ron you said before that i learned how to do some of the auror spells which ones do you know about jared brows furrowed in thought for a moment there wand transfiguration you can change a wand into different objects why would that be something worth learning asked ron i mean you can throw spells in a duel with a wand not if you erect a barrier with talismans explained jared it not that hard to do it happened in the ministry of magic over twenty years ago it was covered up i dontknow exactly what year it happened but parts of the ministry were blown apart someone had put a barrier that kept the minister officials from getting inside the problem with wizards is that they are trained to rely upon wands too much they donttrain themselves properly to fight in hand to hand combat at least your average run of the mill wizard doesn t the transfiguration of a wand is difficult to do but if a certain type of a barrier is up the spells can be absorbed by it you re learning this in your dada class arentyou asked ron that explains something though he glanced at jared a big section of the ministry was taped off from the public it wasntthe same places where the summer incident happened it happened sometime in november i haventseen the damn itself but it was enough for the prophet to cover it the ministry is writing it off as a remodeling job jared pulled himself up a bit more with a slight wince what part the courtrooms answered ron as he folded his arms over his chest the big meeting that the new minister had with the world delegates had to be moved the following day i mean how many people plan on doing remodeling in the middle of important meetings like that with what been going on i didntthink it was that important in fact this is irrelevant right now what we re talking about is something that is going on outside current timeline and that what we have to focus on it about you and hermione and me he paused again it all my fault that this is happening i didntlisten you back there said jared quietly you said that there was no way you would send me back warn you about it i left with very little information i was also angry with you for not trusting me ron straightened up and gazed at him did it even occur to you that i might have been trying to protect you look at yourself you ve got a scar on your neck because of me he shook his head and was going to say something else but he didntwant to get angry with jared instead he went to the down opened it and left he let it swing close behind him when ron came back he saw that everyone was looking at him expectantly he noticed that ginny and hermione were gone ginny is lending some clothes to hermione said harry knowing ron question before he could ask it ron nodded you were saying that you knew about magus continued harry what did you figure out he an animagus answered ron this isntthe first time that he gone after them to get to me that scar on jared neck is from the first round there are going to be some amazing and disturbing advancements in the ways that we try to hurt each other where did mum go he looked around and saw on his brothers and harry she waiting for dad answered charlie she just left after she told you that jared want to see you it was fred who let it slip magus is out there said ron it not his real name he just pulled his name out of the word for what he is he the raven that was out in the forest and he knows where the grangers live we have to make sure nothing happens to hermione parents he looked at each one of them and they looked back at him expectantly look i have no idea what i doing i not anything yet but you have the potential pointed harry it seemed that the boys had discussed it among themselves and harry had been elected to speak for the group magus cantget to you even now he knows the only way to get to you is through them i think we have to tell hermione what going on even if she doesntbelieve a word of it no refused ron coldly we arent telling her anything too many people already do molly and arthur walked in that moment ron stopped talking and turned around he walked out of the room and back towards the room that jared was staying in without saying a word arthur immediately went after him he wasntentirely surprised that the door had been locked with a spell what did he say demanded arthur loudly without turning around he repeated when none of them gave an answer what did he say i will not continue having these kinds of secrets in my family do i make myself clear jared looked at ron with alarm when he heard what arthur had said what the bloody hell does that mean he asked jared rarely heard his grandfather raise his voice like that i have no idea muttered ron he kept his back on the door for a moment longer and stepped forward how are you feeling are you well enough to move yeah answered jared with a nod why because you need to go back to hogwarts answered ron he heaved a sigh at the end if you re gone hermione wontbe asking as many questions if you two stay in the same place it will be too easy for him to find you both what kind of plan is that asked jared with great apprehension ron heard his father knocking on the door giving him a chance to open it it not whispered ron get up and get dressed there a bathroom through that other door he referred to the one on the left jared got up slowly and went to the bathroom after grabbing his clothes were hanging on the other door which led to a closet he was just in his boxers and a shirt as soon as the bathroom door was closed ron opened the door to let his father in arthur had his hand raised to hit the door again and was a little stunned when ron opened the door he was confront with his son who was nearly as tall as him and looking straight into his eyes i did what i had to do said ron quietly as he gripped his wand tightly he knew that jared was listening at the door arthur closed his eyes for a moment i already lost a son he whispered quietly ron didntknow what to say about that no one else in the family other than himself and ginny knew that percy was dead ron was starting to wonder just if his father already knew it then you know why i have to do this whispered ron back to him the door opened and jared peeked out a bit come on jared said ron loudly without turning around jared shrugged and closed the door behind him his shoes were at the foot of the bed so he grabbed them and exited the room he had neglected to put his socks on as well ron let him exit out first molly had gotten in their way jared looked at ron where are your socks dear your feet must be cold she told him it all right mrs weas now that not right molly chided i dontknow why i didntsee it before you have your father bone structure and your feet looks like just like his and so do your hands she lifted them up to look at them jared turned his head to gave ron a pained look mum leave him alone ginny doing a good job keeping hermione distracted jared has to go back to hogwarts said ron as he smiled slightly he said as he put his hand on jared shoulder put your socks on before hermione gets back here jared shrugged and sat down on one of the chairs and puts them on so you do listen to me on occasion when i feel like it said jared using his american accent again ron sighed arthur put his hand on ron shoulder you ll have the patience parents grow with their children he told him knowingly jared got up when he got his shoes on hermione came back wearing some of ginny clothes they all went quiet when she came in they all went silent what going on jared why are you up i feeling better i just got a sudden call from my relatives here in england i not that close to them but they ve invited me to see them for christmas looks like i wontbe joining you after all he explained smoothly oh by the way before i forget i have your christmas present in the other room i ll go get it jared went pass her hermione looked directly at ron with a perplexed look but he looked straight at her and shrugged you still didnttell me what going on ron said hermione quietly trust me said ron as he walked passed her to join jared in the other room hermione turned her attention to everyone else why am i the only one who doesntknow what going on here she looked at harry who looked away from her this has something to do with jared too doesntit look either someone is going to tell me what going on or i ll figure it out on my own she sighed when she saw that none of them held any expression of giving in harry can you lend me hedwig i have to write my parents sure said harry as he got to his feet ginny come with us he needed to make sure he wasntalone with hermione too long because he was afraid he d cave in so ginny followed along well this is all very interesting said charlie breaking the silence i mean it not like we re not saying something important to them bill looked at their parents it not like we can explain it because we dontknow what really happened do we dad arthur shook his head ron helped jared pack up his things i dontknow if this is such a good idea said jared softly he paused maybe we should tell her the truth he glanced at ron you were the one in the first place who didntwant to tell her anything pointed out ron this is the best i can come up with i dontthink that anyone could have come up with something better i wish i had a better on jared sat down on the bed it will be the first time i ve ever had a christmas without any family i normally go home every winter holiday i donteven know how i ll get back onto the school grounds arentthey closed for the holidays anyway how am i supposed to explain it you mentioned that dumbledore already knows so does de luca and snape probably has a vague idea it wontbe that hard for you to get back to the school answered ron he gave a chuckle which made jared look at him funny i didntthink i was capable of thinking like this like what i dontknow i always thought that harry and hermione were so much smarter than me i the sidekick that offers all kinds of sarcastic commentary jared laughed actually when you re sarcastic you tend to be right at least from what i ve noticed you make good observations that way he picked up the bag from the bookstore i didnt get time to wrap it but i guess she wontmind ron picked up jared bag and carried it out i just wish you d trust me more ron i can take care of myself i do trust you said ron at the door it the rest of the world that i have a problem with you know i really should apologize to my parents for being a pain an jared and his father are very close it is the incident in his third year that kept him from joining the quidditch team for two years ron became very overprotective of his child the part that the rest of the family was discussing tie into the next fanfic ron wants to protect both hermione and jared he also starting to notice that the more annoying qualities that jared possesses come from him kirikarin livejournal com take out the spaces disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty four kiss and tell when everyone gathered again for dinner it was a tense affair hermione didntmention the kiss to ginny at all because ron acted like he hadntdone anything she had a feeling that he was thinking of something else there was something that was really worrying him because he seemed more anxious than anyone else molly wouldntallow ron just to send jared on his way without feeding him first if anything it seemed that more attention was being heaped on jared as molly heaped more food on his plate he was as polite as his parents had taught him to be and he didntwant to hurt his grandmother feelings he was sitting between ron and arthur jared didntfeel very hungry as he twirled one a noodle around his fork it was one of his favorite dishes spaghetti and meatballs thank you mrs weasley said jared politely as he tried to eat some more it very good i glad you like it said molly jared gave her a grin i love international food i ve been all over the ethnic enclaves that are near where i live they have a lot of india food and chinese food as well in london offered hermione i think that there a chinatown in every major city in the world at least that from what i noticed too bad you re not staying around london long enough i could take you around jared nodded my mother said it started when she was pregnant with me she wasntputting on enough weight early on and so she decided to take off from her job at the hospital before she was supposed to she stayed with her parents while my dad went off to work i suppose she was watching too much television during that time he laughed you see she started carving whatever she was seeing on the screen my dad didntwant her apparating all over the world because of her condition so he did ron nearly choked on his water while everyone else was laughing my mother told me that the first thing he said when i was born was so you re the one i ve been going all over the world for at least that what she tells me my dad has never denied it he glanced at ron are you all right ron fine croaked ron it just went down the wrong way he saw that jared was on the verge of laughter you ve got a lousy sense of humor if you re going to laugh right now i ve been told that i ve inherited my father sense of humor jared told him mildly arthur laughed first followed by everyone else hermione was clueless but she was getting the feeling that jared was just teasing ron i see said ron he said the next thing through his teeth by the way i ve been meaning to apologize for any headaches that i might have caused for you mum and dad it come to my attention that i can be very annoying downright obnoxious actually corrected fred george added and stubborn as a pig that enough you two chided molly as she settled down with a plate of food for herself these days she spent more time serving food than actually eating it but for the first time in weeks molly felt at ease with the knowledge of jared existence she smiled fondly at her grandson are you sure you ll be all right jared i ll be fine i can take care of myself answered jared if that one thing my parents made sure of it that do you ever worry about your father having such a dangerous occupation asked arthur remember what jared had said before jared nodded and said it what he does though it important no one else can do the job that he does because he the best at it he doesnt talk about his work that often because he doesntwant my mother and me to worry about him not knowing sometimes is worse at least what my mother does isntdangerous in the least she makes sure that things come out all right one way or another the rest of the dinner went on with less tension because of jared more humorous comments the twins bill and charlie delighted in asking questions about his father while ron didntknow whether to laugh or deny things that hadnthappened yet ginny reminded rather solemn and it seemed like she wasntthere from time to time she knew that ron had other things to think about but she couldnthelp but think of the empty space that she felt when dinner concluded they were graced with the company of remus lupin who none of the people from hogwarts had seen until that moment jared was greeted warmly as he observed the ongoing conversation can i talk to you later arthur asked remus i mean in private arthur gave a nod as an answer there was definitely something going on as arthur excused himself from the room for a moment to do something jared didnthave time to really think about it because he soon found himself under the gaze of remus so you re leaving whereabouts in america are you from jared los angeles answered jared smoothly so how well do you know everyone here i was told that this is the headquarters for the group that has worked with dumbledore since the last time that vo i mean you know who was around in his generation they were taught not to be afraid of the name remus nodded why are you leaving so soon i dontthink it in the weasleys nature to throw anyone out he said with some amusement my relatives in england want to see me my parents got in contact with them i just wished they would have figured it out sooner but my parents are busy people so it understandable what is it your parents do my father is an auror and my mother is a healer very interesting i always thought so there was a lull as remus seemed to study jared at great length for a moment he shifted uncomfortably well i think that i should get going soon he said yet he didntseem to be able to move from the chair they were staring at each other now ron cleared his throat to interrupt what was happening jared are you sure you re ready my dad will take you right dad yes answered arthur with a slight smile at jared it looked like it was for his son but it was really for his grandson come along we mustntkeep them waiting of course said molly but she didntlook entirely too happy about it for some odd reason neither she nor arthur objected to jared leaving it seemed that they were following along with whatever ron had to say or what he thought was best i do have something for you dear she handed him a bundle that was wrapped in brown paper now dontyou open it until christmas you hear jared nodded as he accepted the lump bundle he already knew what was in it he had been getting a weasley sweater every year since he was born he had a feeling it was in maroon not that jared minded so much molly had a tradition of giving her grandchildren whatever color sweater she had knitted for her children rather impulsively he embraced her and molly hugged him back with all her might he normally would have given her a kiss on the cheek but decided against it thank you for everything he told her she smiled back at him i was right i can tell that your parents taught you good manners jared laughed as he turned his attention to hermione briefly here something for you it not much but i hope it something you like have a happy christmas he told her i ll see the rest of you back at school are you sure you re all right to leave asked hermione suddenly i mean what about what happened to you earlier jared gave her a gentle grin as he answered i think that i ll feel better as soon as i get back with my relatives perhaps i just a little homesick i ve been in england for a long time now all right agreed hermione as she gave him a brief hug she could see that ron wasntreacting the way she had expected as he watched them let go see you all later said jared i ll see you back at hogswart he gave them a wave as he walked up to arthur they walked into one of the dens it was the only one that had a fireplace that went out of the old manor he threw some floo powder into the fire and said the name of an inn that was in hogsmeade as soon as he was gone jared followed the same procedure to jared surprise they were met by professor de luca he looked at them expectantly who told you i was coming asked jared as he looked at his grandfather for an answer i had to tell someone to make sure that you stayed safe and out of trouble answered arthur jared spun around completely to face him my dad doesntknow about this you didnttell him you were going to do this now now said the professor calmly as he got to his feet from the soft chair that he was sitting at there is no reason for you to be upset i have already figured out who you were weeks ago i was wondering why you were even here arthur contacted me earlier that why you left when remus lupin came you were calling him arthur licked his lips as he saw his reflection in jared eyes how betrayed he must have felt at the moment it was the same look that arthur had seen for the briefest instant on someone else face i have to do what it takes to keep you safe your father isntold enough yet nor does he have the experience to even fathom what it might feel to lose you arthur told jared plainly jared expression softened slightly arthur marveled at how much he resembled ron he put his hand on his shoulder and pulled him into an embrace you keep yourself safe we will do what we can to keep your parents safe as well happy christmas he murmured softly into jared ear arthur pulled back and placed a kiss on jared forehead it was a gesture that jared remembered as a small child arthur turned his attention to professor de luca and simply said you keep him safe i will arthur left before they made their way to the castle in silence jared wondered if he was going to have to face dumbledore this wasntorder business at all he also wondered what was going on back where his parents were the biggest question of all was what was going to happen next things were pretty much at a stand still while hermione was there ron didntwant to talk about magus while she was awake with ginny however she wasntmaking it easy not to talk about jared she was worried about him obviously ron forced the twins to lend him one of the extendable ears to listen until hermione and ginny went to sleep what going on it seems sort of sudden to send jared on his way like that said hermione as ron listened i have a feeling that your brother had something to do with it what happened i mean you kept me in here for a while picking out clothes hermione haventyou noticed how similar jared is to ron offered ginny she was aware of the fact that anyone could be listening to their conversation that and did notice fred handing something to ron earlier i mean other than just personality wise well i did find out earlier that they were the same size other than that hermione paused for a long moment contemplating what ginny was asking of her he doesnthave red hair like ron but he seems to have the same body structure that kind of odd isnt it she turned her attention to more pressing manners are you sure it okay that i borrow your clothes for tonight until i can get my own i dontknow if my mum will be okay with me coming back for just my clothes she probably very ticked off right now it all right said ginny brightly after all what are sisters for hermione gave ginny a strange look what a strange phrase to be using ginny immediately corrected herself what i mean is sometimes i think you re like the sister i ve never had oh said hermione as she bit her bottom lip she had something to talk about she wasntparticularly close to any of the other girls at gryffindor but she didntknow if she wanted to bring it up with ginny especially since it concerned ron ginny something happened it was the way that ron showed up suddenly he came to see me at the ball at the time i was just grateful to be away from there but now i wondering why he did it then jared collapsed and just left so i can think about it now when ginny didntsay anything it prompted hermione to continue i wasnt going to go with him he said something about the raven i didnttell you but ron and i saw one when we got lost outside of the maze for professor de luca class he saw it outside we both did it was black in a sea of white he told me we had to go but i couldntjust go then he kissed me now that got ginny attention as she stared at hermione somewhat dumbfounded h he kissed you my brother ron kissed you she practically squeaked she went on in a hurried pace where i mean did he kiss you on the cheek or on the lips how long was it did anything else happen tell me for merlin sake dontjust stand there ginny was very excited as she grabbed hermione by the shoulders and shook her vigorously calm down ginny not so loud pleaded hermione as she blushed other people might hear you stop calm down ron who was listening carefully wasntpaying much attention to the discussion that harry was having with his brothers it was charlie who noticed that ron had turned as red as tomato which really clashed with his hair what wrong ron he asked nothing muttered ron as he didntpull the extendable ear away he just had to find out what hermione thought of him he was calling more attention to himself as fred and george got to their feet and made a grab for the extendable ear bill charlie and harry stood back a little bit because they didntwant to get involved in the scuffle ginny was staring at hermione intently in the other room well you said you were going to answer me why are you so excited for ginny because of morbid curiosity come on now on with it hermione regretted saying anything she should have never brought it up at all she sighed he kissed me on the lips it wasntthat long maybe a second or two he wanted me to come along with him and i didntwant to that when he kissed me i never knew you to be the type of girl who just went along because a boy kisses you hermione teased ginny i guess it depends on who that boy is doesntit so this begs the question how do you really feel about my brother hmm leave me alone moaned hermione avoiding the subject all together meanwhile in the other room fred and george had managed to get up close enough to hear what was making their younger brother so red they pulled back when they heard hermione answer to ginny question the twins were giving ron a pretty strange yet stern look you kissed her asked fred quite flabbergasted you come on now dontbe shy you obviously get to kiss more times than that one time tonight after all you re going to have to do a lot more than kissing to pop out a kid added george slyly bill came to ron rescue lay off him you two what kind of uncles are you going to be i declare that jared penchant for trouble making is heavily influenced by you two harry was trying very hard not to laugh at ron but there was definitely a smile tugging at his mouth charlie joined the twins in the teasing so that how you got her to come along with you you must be quite the kisser ron could only repeat what hermione had said earlier leave me alone it seemed like that bright red hue on his face wasntgoing to go away any time soon just as jared had predicted he was ushered up straight to professor dumbledore office it was much different from the office he was used to jared had made frequent trips to that office in his own time the other time that jared was in dumbledore office he hadntreally taken a close look around it seemed that professor dumbledore was a man who liked puzzles because there seemed to be a few of them about jared was immediately drawn to fawkes who had just finished a burning day so the phoenix was a beautiful red color with gold feathers i see that you have returned to hogwarts so soon mr blake or would you prefer mr weasley asked professor dumbledore with a twinkle in his eye what happen to calling me just jared you are very much like your father tell me do i get to meet you later on i am curious jared looked at the headmaster directly yes i was about two or three my parents came here for some sort of event it was during the summer i managed to get separated from them and wandered up here you asked me who i was and i asked you who you were i wasnt supposed to talk to you you were a stranger after all at the time but you let me call you bumblebee professor dumbledore chuckled at jared account when he was done he said it is a bit of a relief to meet you jared the last few years have been rather difficult even i am allowed to have some of my own doubts so i take it that harry potter is your godfather he is replied jared a very protective caring and loving one as a matter of fact if there was anyone who loves me just as much as my parents do he does and that saying a lot jared statement seemed to put professor dumbledore at ease jared never noticed how tense harry would get at the mere mention of the headmaster i need you to explain everything to me right now jared if any of my students are in danger i must be made aware of it jared knew there was no way out of it so he started telling dumbledore the whole story from beginning to end without stopping or diverting into things that were unimportant when he was done the dumbledore looked like he was in deep thought as he regarded jared problem coming here was probably meant to be concluded dumbledore you were meant to be here i dontknow what going on back there ron thought it was a good idea to send me back here because hermione with him now i starting to think that it might be easier just to tell her what going on but ron said no and you re going along with it jared shrugged i have selective hearing but you cantreally expect me to sit idle when bad things are happening that really how injustice can happen at least that what my father always says your father is right said professor dumbledore but do you understand the ramifications of your actions the ministry of magic has very stern punishments for those who tamper with the time stream and i afraid you have caused many violations i aware of that but i dontthink my grandfather who works for the ministry really cares and neither does my grandmother and even now i know that you arentgetting along any better with the ministry than i am of course by the time i come along the spells are better developed i see i suppose i have to give some credit to hermione on your ingenuity said dumbledore musingly i wonteven ask thank you professor dumbledore said jared as he got to his feet if you dontmind i ve had a hard night and i need some sleep the professor nodded and jared exited the room he returned to the gryffindor common room and found that it was pretty much empty most of the parents preferred to have their children home with them for the holidays and with the attacks that were going on from the death eaters none of them were willing to leave their children over the holidays to jared that didntmake much sense because hogwarts happened to be one of the safest places to be he doubted that most of the other children parents houses were anything like 12 grimmauld place so jared had to find another way to amuse himself before he went to bed and since he had already finished all of his homework and didntfeel like studying he took out his sketchbook jared began to do a more detailed drawing of a raven just as ron had described to him no one really knew where jared had inherited his artistic inclinations the grangers and weasleys dealt in words and numbers quite well however very few of them were artists actually none of them were artists jared was a very good drawer and was quite gifted he thought of becoming an artist when he was older it was the only career that he thought a lot of he wasntdiscouraged by his grandparents on his mother side but on his father side they exhibited some discomfort at his artistic abilities jared was the one weasley who knew how to play different musical instruments as well his mother spent a good amount of her time nurturing these gifts however the weasleys were a little fazed by his drawing more than anything else perhaps it had something to do one summer when he was around eight or nine and he wandered into a room that wasntused by anyone it was the room that faced the backyard on the third floor of the burrow it was strange that no one ever used that room it had belonged to jared uncle percy and it was left as it was the day he had walked out on the family it became a sort of shrine after he had died it was there that jared felt the most comfortable because there wasnt anyone going in there to bother him and sometimes he couldntstand all the activity because he was an only child after all jared would go up into his uncle room for a couple of minutes at a time it was there that he had found his uncle old school books and things along with a notebook that had drawings in it his grandmother was very upset to find him in that room that summer molly calmed down after jared expressed how little he understood he had never heard of his uncle much and had only seen a few pictures of him his grandmother explained that the room was just as percy had left it and that she and his grandfather just couldntchange it jared asked about some of the pictures one of the pictures in particular almost made molly cry it was a portrait of a girl who had curly hair and it was dated sometime in percy last year in hogwarts she didntsay who it was but said it was someone who was very special to percy after that talk molly escorted jared out of the room but didntmake him promise never to go there again when he had gone home he drew a picture of his uncle and the following day he put the picture back in the room without telling anyone he had drawn it from memory jared finished drawing the picture of the raven he had thought about how magus looked the picture that was in the file was of magus when he was taken to azkaban it was vastly different than what he would look these days in truth jared was afraid of falling asleep he didntwant to relive that again his mind had buried for years and now he could remember it better however in his vision he managed to block most of it it was the face that was the problem there was no doubt in his mind that magus changed his appearance but he wasnta metamorphmagus magus was a clever man who employed everything in his disposal to cover up his crimes he would kill other wizards and assume their identities by making polyjuice potions he killed muggles and left their bodies at the steps of the ministry but he was always gone before anyone could get to him by the time jared was born the ministry had all kinds of security measures that including wider areas where barriers prevented apparation disapparation it made sense that magus was an animagus because the ministry foolishly thought that people would register themselves jared sighed as he closed his sketchbook and left it on the table he was going to have to go to sleep he didntget up to go to bed he had to sleep so that he could dream so that he could see the face of his father enemy an jared does hold the key and he knows how magus really looks like but is he really safe that a good question because he by himself in gryffindor i did have to throw in some humor to balance things out poor ron and hermione they are really stumbling along and the cool thing with a time travel story is that i can plan for any plot loop holes kirikarin i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty five christmas morning ron couldntsleep he was too anxious to do so as he lay awake sometimes harry fretted a bit when he slept ron was a little used to it however harry seemed to be sleeping peacefully for a change of pace ron had no idea that he was going to end up with a child very much like harry there was no denying that jared was special of course ron was his father and like every proud parent he thought his child was something special it was more than that there was something very special about jared but ron didntquite get it he doubted that his future self understood it any better than his younger self it seemed fairly obvious that jared was going to grow up to be some extraordinary person ron didnthave much money but he did pick up something for hermione harry and jared he had meant to give hermione present a bit earlier but with the interruption of the raven that was not possible he had picked her up a simple necklace that had a small pendant on it it wasntanything all that expensive or special just a bit of crystal actually ron couldntafford to get hermione birth stone anyway jared was a little hard to shop for but he expressed that he did like to read a lot ron picked up a book at flourish and blotts it was novel written by a wizard for harry ron got him another book about spells against the dark arts to add to harry ever growing collection it seemed only right considering what harry was going to become in the future the book was an advance one that a former auror had written ron was very restless and couldntsleep very well at all so he got up and ventured downstairs he was stared at the fireplace for a long period of time wondering if jared would call when that didnthappen within the first ten minutes he got up to pace around back and forth in the silence of the night he was starting to think about how magus wanted him dead because of what he would do ron jaw clenched as he sped up his pacing there was no way he was going to let someone like magus get away with what he was doing he was going to stop him one way or another couldntsleep either ron father voice interrupted arthur was at the bottom of the staircase looking at ron with a bit of a wry smile can you believe it dad i havent even had him and i already pacing and worrying moaned ron as he plopped down on the chair in front of the fireplace you d think he d call or something doesnthe know i sitting here arthur chuckled at ron as he took a seat next to him you sound like your mother he observed he like his mother he doesnt like to listen to me said ron gruffly i told him back where he came from not to do this and he went and did it anyway i thinking of leaving myself a note to punish him when he gets back i ll just seal it in an envelope and open it after he gets back you must admit that his intentions are good pointed out arthur he a good lad he like you ron exclaimed as he threw his arms into the air why does everyone keep saying that even hermione and she got no idea who he really is she said that even before i found out arthur shook his head and chucked again it sort of gratifying to see you so anxious were any of us like this asked ron last year when you and your sister went to the department of mysteries answered arthur promptly your mother had a fit and i swore that if you were both all right i would kill you both anyway for making us worry so much i think that wishing children just like you and having it actually happen is satisfying enough ron shook his head well there only one thing left for me to do then he got to his feet and smiled at his father good night what the last thing ron asked arthur i just going to wish the same thing on jared replied ron as he grinned and climbed up the stairs to go to bed all arthur could really do was shake his head because the cycle was continuing the following morning jared got up early because it was too quiet sleeping in a room that was normally occupied by more than one person at almost any given time it was the silence that roused him and this was also the first holiday that he ever spent separated from his family his mother and father always had him home every winter he couldntremember one christmas and that was the one when he was attacked he now understood why none of his friends or family really talked about it it was because he had blocked it out of his memory and they didntthink it was a good idea for him to bring it up until he was ready jared got up and proceeded to the bathroom as he washed his face he stared at the scar along his neck he remembered how protective harry had been up till his third year his parents did let him go to hogsmeade but harry always seemed to pop up at the same places that jared was in they had spent a lot of time keeping him alive and untroubled harry made it his mission not only to keep jared alive but ensure him as normal a childhood as possible harry didnthave a normal childhood by the time he would become a professor in hogwarts he had spent more than half his life just trying to stay alive there came a time that harry realized that he was never going to be normal and to accept that he would always be different deep down jared knew that harry envied ron for having all the things that he had longed for jared was practically harry first child even though harry would eventually get married and have children of his own he finished up and ventured downstairs to the common room the fire was there because the house elves kept it up during the night he opened the brown parcel that molly had given him and found the customary weasley sweater it was maroon just as he had expected jared shrugged and put it on he was starting to feel less lonely and warmer who knew that a weasley sweater had that much power the fire roared again jared nearly jumped because he could see ron head in the fireplace gah he exclaimed you almost gave me a bloody heart attack not so loud warned ron hermione might be up any minute i was just wondering how you were doing you didnt call last night i was under the impression that i wasntsuppose to said jared as he crouched down closer to the fire i fine so how do i look he was referring to the sweater do you actually like maroon not really but she likes knitting them for me so i dontmind it makes her happy to see me appreciate it ron was wearing a sweater that wasntvery different from jared s in fact they were identical jared was just a good kid who really didntseek to hurt anyone feelings and it feels like having a slice of home happy christmas jared stay safe said ron happy christmas said jared he didnt add the last part until after ron was gone dad it was time to go and get some breakfast he put on some shoes and went down to the great hall professor de luca greeted him with a smile happy christmas jared happy christmas professor professor snape was watching jared carefully he must have been appraised of the situation as he walked up to jared so you re their son he asked yes professor snape answered jared plainly unlike ron he bore no ill will towards professor snape in fact he seemed to have a certain amount of respect towards him i knew that you would be here for the holidays as well but i didnt expect professor de luca to be here i chose to stay rather than return to my order during the holidays said professor de luca jared joined some of the other students who were sticking around it seemed like he was the only one remaining from gryffindor there were three from ravenclaw two from hufflepuff and to jared utter surprise malfoy had remained with crabbe and goyle so you re here blake i thought you left with weasley and potter said malfoy let me guess they didnt want you either i was wanted but it was overwhelming said jared what are you doing here i thought a spoiled boy like you would be home with his parents my father is in azkaban malfoy informed him thanks to potter and his little friends oh i forgot that jared added quite genuinely sorry about that malfoy snapped i dontneed your pity blake he seemed utterly frustrated so he stalked off so suddenly that it too longer than normal for it to register with crabbe and goyle to go after him jared almost felt bad for malfoy it was hard for him to understand how that bitter boy could turn into one of the best teachers in hogwarts but that was almost twenty years from that point jared marveled at the idea that someone could change so drastically over that time he ended up sitting with the two hufflepuffs because they were the friendliest of the others he didnt really talk that much to anyone in particular professor mcgonagall was probably told what was going on based on the way she looked at him when he walked in after breakfast jared decided to take a walk out to hagrid cabin and see if the groundskeeper was in but he interrupted by professor de luca do you really think it wise to go outside he asked with a tone that told jared it wasn t it boring in here said jared mildly yes you seem to be the type who prefers a lot of excitement agreed the dada professor you are a bit of a handful for your parents my parents are used to it said jared although my father always says that my body isntmine until i of age so it up to him to keep me in one piece whatever that means do you ever wish that you could have a wife and kids of your own not really said professor de luca there is a lot of evil in the world and from the looks of it there is more in the future as well i have devoted myself to this life to rid the world of evil and to keep others safe i am never really lonely in my fight or in my life it is very gratifying existence one doesntneed to have his or her own children in order to feel that they have contributed something to society jared jared nodded as he found himself walking with professor de luca i think you re the one who baptized me he said thoughtful i dontremember but i was raised catholic my father family have been catholic for generations and my mom never converted but her family hardly practices whatever they re supposed to be my maternal grandparents are too scientific to take things on blind faith professor de luca chuckled that really what blind faith is about i suppose they believe in magic because they ve seen it or at least a small part of it but it didntstop with the generation before you i was a handful compared to her they really werentready for me my nana always said that i had more energy and could cause more trouble than my mother ever could admitted jared i was disruptive at their house you know muggle things are surprisingly delicate to magic i once shorted out their dvd player because my papa wouldntlet me watch something on it jared glanced at professor de luca who had a mystified look obviously he didntknow what a dvd player was jared smiled as he continued i was okay to be baby sat until i hit two years old after that my mum or dad had to be there otherwise they couldnthandle me it not simple to tell a child wizard that magic is a no no and try to explain it using the laws of adults it wasntuntil i was eight when i was old enough to not use to my magic when i was upset there is a theory that is running in some circles said professor de luca the pureblood families like the malfoys and others like them are truly afraid of people from muggle lines just suddenly having magic however some believe that a hybrid child will function best between both worlds the racism is more rampant i afraid pointed out jared there are more and more children like me and harry he was always the one who could talk to me about being a half blood my parents have their arguments over how to raise me it either too much magic will prompt laziness or it part of my heritage i should use it usually they try to reach some kind of compromise the world only gets more complicated as the time marches on concluded professor de luca hermione was having a hard time trying to figure out what was going on with ron he was withdrawn he and harry had their heads together discussing something or someone hermione was also getting strange looks from ron brothers who were being very nice to her for some strange reason perhaps jared did have the right idea of leaving she had to get away from ginny for a little bit because she was making her feel rather uncomfortable she crept downstairs early in the morning to put some more presents at the tree she put ron gift next to harry s she had bought a nice scarf for ginny she would have made them herself but she couldntknit very well hermione was concentrating so hard at that moment that she hadntheard ron come down the stairs happy christmas hermione he said softly she whirled in surprise he pulled back with his hands in front of him sorry didnt mean to surprise you you ve been doing that a lot lately murmured hermione she was unable to look him in the eye at least when they were alone and right now they were very much alone she added hastily oh happy christmas to you too ron yeah sighed ron as he looked away from her his ears were bright red he was lucky that his whole wasntas red as it was last night i got you something it not much really it all right at least you got me here said hermione softly as she accepted ron gift she opened it and found a pair of combs for her hair these are beautiful she smiled up at him but he wasntlook at her ron was having some difficult getting over his shyness i glad you like them i got them at diagon alley the lady said that if you lose one you can get them both to glow to find the other pair just in case i dontthink you ll ever lose them he said with a grin so what d you get me hermione laughed as she put one of her hands on her hip and said why dont you go and look for it yourself ron started searching for his present he was going to have to pretend that he was surprised at the gift he already knew what it was and that it was going to fit him just fine he picked it up and carried it to the sofa he sat down with the box and to his surprise hermione took a seat next him ron tore off the wrapper and opened the box he stared at it for a moment what is it he asked it a jacket ron said hermione i didntwant to get you just anything but i thought that you d like something from the muggle world ron pulled it out of the box and put it on it was a little long but it fitted just fine on the shoulders he wasntoverly surprised but he did like the feel of it this is nice hermione he stood up i was worried that it wouldntfit said hermione as she stood up with him you look great how did you know it would fit asked ron as he finally looked her in the eye he saw that she had tipped her chin upwards she was at a disadvantage because she didnthave her heels on any longer so she was much shorter than last night about last night he started as he cleared his throat forget what happened all right i didntreally mean anything by it hermione expression changed from smiling to mystified to angry in less than thirty seconds what that suppose to mean ron she demanded i cantfigure you out these days what wrong with you there nothing wrong with me answered ron nothing at all if anything there something wrong with you me i wasntthe one who showed up suddenly and just took me away you know what going on and you wonttell me anything and what worst is that you trust someone you barely know over me we ve been friends for six years you ve only known jared for less than six months and then you kissed me and act like it was nothing what difference did that really make shouted back ron he didntmean to lose his temper so easily but he wasntabout to back down from a fight you said that you wanted me to get along with jared and now you re mad because i am i cantbelieve you everything i do is wrong no one can do everything as well or as right as little miss perfect i donteven get what you re complaining about now the fact that you told me to forget about last night ron said hermione her feelings were hurt and that would have been obvious to almost anyone but ron was missing it all together you wonteven have a civilized conversation about it what do you want me to say this is just getting stupid he declared i dontwant to continue this any longer come on just tell me what you want me to say i want you to stop dancing around things ron i want direct answers to my questions said hermione i want you tell me what you ve been hiding this entire time there more going on around here than you re telling me everyone knows something and i think it you who keeping everyone from saying something even your parents seem to know what going on ron looked at her plainly for a moment you really are too smart for your own good he looked at her musingly and has it really been just six years it seems like less but at the same time it like we ve known each other our whole lives so you want me to tell you the truth which truth are you talking about why did you kiss me you brought it up first we re back to where we started i thought you were asking about why i took you away from your grandmother house do you want me to answer that question no i want you to answer why you kissed me ron ron shrugged off his new jacket and folded it before he put it down if you have to ask that question hermione then you dontget it he said simply i not going to explain it to you i know that i no where near the type of bloke who should be kissing a girl like you in the first place i didntknow we were categorized as types ron for one thing in the world that we re in i can be the smartest witch in the world and your opinion would still matter more than mine because of who you are said hermione as she crossed her arms over her chest but she was thinking of what he was saying she took his hand sit back down ron my neck is hurting looking up at you i saw your grandmother house said ron it huge and your parents arentbad off either this jacket looks like it cost a fortune i haventgot anything else to go with it this is second major piece of clothing i have that mine to start with and all i got you were those combs do you ever notice how i smell ron asked hermione he wondered about that from time to time as he sat closer to her and he shook his head he never thought she smelt bad she shook her head and laughed you re so forgetful sometimes honestly i wear the perfume you gave me last year for christmas dontyou remember ron noticed that she hadnt let go of his hand yet it was just so natural to feel her hand against his she went on i sorry that i kept asking just now ron didntknow what to say at that point he was thinking of how nice it was to sit with her he couldnthelp but think of how much he really knew even with jared around he could never consider himself as that lucky now it was his turn to be surprised hermione leaned in and kissed him gently on the lips he deepen the kiss and she responded in kind she slowly pulled back with a smile on her lips he grinned back at her it really the best christmas ron had thus far and what made it even better was knowing even better ones were coming later on an the dialogue is particularly aggravating to read as it was to write between hermione and ron in this i wanted to write an adult argument doesntthe end make you feel all warm and squishy poor jared things arentgoing to get any easier for him confession i am official done writing temporal flux it has been finished for the past couple of chapters if anyone kept up with my journal they would know that at the end of the last chapter which isntthe chapter after this i will put up a preview for the next story no i dont want people making demands of me updating immediately because i ll do it when i feel like it anyone attempting will to do will be ignored it imperative that i post both stories before july 16th because that the due date that i set up for myself kirikarin livejournal com disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty six the case file jared was tossing and turning again in his sleep he woke up with a start and in a cold sweat he was heaving for air as he got out of bed he gazed out the window and saw very clearly that the raven was just sitting out on a limb watching him nevermore he whispered as he stared at it he could feel his neck tingling a bit he ran his finger down the side of his neck and then covered the scar with his palm it was at that moment he wished he was back at his own time all he would have to do was go down to his godfather office and he would be there jared had his problems starting out in hogwarts and it was harry who kept him out of it some of the other kids thought it was nepotism at work and it was he didntknow until now that harry was keeping an eye on him to keep him safe at his father request jared wished that he was more aware after that attack that put him in st mungo s he still didntknow how his father succeeded in capturing magus and now the raven was watching him it was going to be difficult to send messages via owl but that was why professor de luca recommended that no messages be sent that way anyway jared marched up to the curtain and drew them closed jared went to his trunk and dug around until he found what he was looking for it was his copy of the little prince his mother used to read it to him all the time when he was younger and it was one of her favorite books as well it was the first book the he ever read by himself jared settled back in bed reading the book until he fell asleep the rest of christmas day was a mixture of satisfaction and embarrassment for ron after the morning kiss with hermione he had to keep a straight face around his brothers but it seemed that bill and charlie had a talk with fred and george hermione found herself at the end of some very nice treatment from molly hermione stopped asking about jared how did you get her to stop asked harry ron shrugged she just decided to stop asking on her own like he was going to tell harry about how she got her to stop i talked to jared earlier he seems fine but i dontknow if he still safe yeah agreed harry we know that there ways of getting into the castle that is discreet but getting to jared isntgoing to get him what he wants which is you i wish there was some way of me to get a message to myself said ron if only had i had taken the time to give jared some kind of plan now there a thought said harry there a way for you to get a message back to yourself assuming that what happening right now is affecting the future timeline the theory of temporal flux jared mentioned it maybe there is a way for you to send yourself a message one that you would receive sometime later on yes but how would i do it asked ron out loud as he paced back and forth he stopped in front of his trunk jared has the same trunk just older he got down on his knees and opened it he pulled out a roll of parchment paper along with a quill and some ink he emptied out the rest of the contents and put it all on the bed then pulled out the panel normally i keep my extra pocket money in here along with some sweets jared used it to hide hermione diary along with the photograph harry watch the door tell me if anyone is coming completely understanding what ron was about to do harry went to the door without hesitation and closed it ron began to write a letter to himself he didntwant to delay anything so he wrote as quickly as possible giving himself instructions about what to do in the event of jared leaving somehow ron was going to have to get himself to put a plan of action or at least the case file of magus into the trunk okay this is confusing i have to put this letter in the hidden bottom of this trunk said ron out loud then assuming that i trust myself enough i have to get the case file to jared back in the trunk as well i donteven know where this trunk will be i donteven know if jared uses it the whole time he attending hogwarts or just for this we ll just have to take that chance ron said harry are you done yes answered ron as he put sealed the letter without any wax because there wasntenough time he put it on the bottom of his trunk all i have to do is keep the letter here he piled his things back inside i hope that i get it back there one way to find out fast jared would have to open the trunk and check said harry we cantsend a message via owl not if magus assumes his animagi form he ll intercept any messages but he didntput the diary back in the bottom did he asked ron where is the diary i think that ginny has it and she sharing a room with hermione answered harry why i need it answered ron he thought about it for a moment okay i ll distract this time you go to ginny and get the diary put it in your trunk all right agreed harry this works out better you re better at distracting hermione than i am anyway he grinned from ear to ear ron shook his head as he closed his trunk they walked out of the room looking for them as soon as soon as they came downstairs they saw that the girls were downstairs helping molly with something mum we need to get some help on the winter homework assignments announced ron molly gave him a mystified look and asked didntyou say that you finished those already we need someone to double check it answered ron hermione always does it for us this is my winter vacation from school and you expect me to help you out with your school work asked hermione ron and harry replied in unison yes hermione opened her mouth and closed it again i always have to help you guys out with school work when we re not in school when we re in school you dontwant to listen to me i not helping you she folded her arms over her chest fine agreed ron if you want us to fail that fine we didntneed you anyway hermione rolled her eyes and sighed as she handed back the cloth she was using to wipe down the dinner table fine i ll help you the last thing i want is you to blame me for it i sorry mrs weasley it all right said molly as she walked off with ron harry lingered behind and waited for molly to go back to work at the stove he really had to hand it ron because he really knew hermione better than anyone would have thought ginny mind giving us back what jared gave you asked harry in a low voice ginny nodded and said to her mother mum i ll be back i ll have to go and give harry back something of jared s he gave her a sharp look all right ginny said molly as they walked off as soon as they were going up the stairs harry asked why d you just tell her the truth because there a lot of lying going on around here anyway answered ginny i starting to fail to see why we have to continue lying like this my mother already knows what going on she been practically gushing at jared since she found out who he is suddenly she paying more attention to ron than she normally does and that way more than what he used to it funny because ron would rather be left alone but she been giving him a lot of parenting advice while you were with our brothers she paused and then added and another thing the best thing about a good lie is one closest to the truth the further you get from the truth the harder it is to keep it up and make it believable good point agreed harry begrudgingly you know i think i like it better when you were too shy to speak to me directly those days are long gone harry said ginny as they stopped in front of the girls room you can wait out here i ll bring it to you harry tapped his foot impatiently as he waited ginny came back with the diary wrapped in parchment you can have it back because i cantread it while she here anyway and i feel kind of bad for having it and sharing the same room with her right said harry feeling some of the guilt i have to go and drop it off in my room you can go back to your mother now all right said ginny as she went off harry shook his head and wondered about how little he really knew about ginny not that he really cared but she had a cunning nature about her that harry had only really seen in fred and george when he got to the room he put the diary in his trunk and grabbed his assignments he came back down to the living room where were you harry asked hermione we turned around and you were gone mrs weasley talked to me for a bit answered harry and i had to find my assignments i was just asking hermione if we could just check her homework against ours she said no ron hermione homework is at her parents house that what i ve been trying to tell him harry said hermione as she shook her head at ron he thinks that i memorize my homework why didntyou ask jared while he was here he probably finished the assignments before he even came here and knowing him he would have memorized it too let me guess he wouldnthelp you ron raised his eyebrow and cleared his throat well he never helps anyone we didntexpect him to help us he has the right idea it my fault for helping you both in the first place said hermione harry started laughing hermione glared at him you know that you re going to help us in the end he told her you always do hermione did you get in contact with your parents yet i got a letter from my dad thanks for letting me use hedwig my mum really mad and so is my grandmother he ll try to smooth things over but he said that it will take a while to pull off hermione glanced at both of them it will be hard to do because my dad still doesntknow why i left so suddenly i cantexplain it either because neither of you will tell me anything dontworry about it hermione said ron soothingly you were the one who freaked out when you saw that raven pointed out hermione and what about jared he collapsed near that pond i dontthink he should have left and you made him leave ron how do you know that i made him do anything asked ron he asked harry when has he ever actually listened to me harry shrugged why would he listen to you hermione glanced back and forth between the two of them and sighed fine have it your way you know for all the times that i have been there for you two you d think that you d trust me with some big secret ron i always there for you when you complain about pointless things harry i there when you feel like the rest of the world doesntunderstand you did either of you think that i might need something from both you just once did it occur to you that what we might be doing is for you asked ron as he looked her straight in the eye suddenly harry felt like he didntreally belong in the room he just sat there are ron continued and stop thinking of jared so much he not here so he not part of the problem it between the three of us and harry dontleave the room now would you mind helping us with the assignments hermione reluctantly went back to helping them but both of them knew that she wasntletting this go she was going to keep at it until they broke however they went right to work and it seemed that things would stand still for a bit magus sat at the top of the tree branch he knew that the mudblood pup was back in hogwarts and that they were actually careful about him leaving the castle however he had tangled with the boy before and knew that the child naturally inquisitive nature would get the better of him soon enough yes magus still regarded jared as a mere child yet he didntdeem ron weasley that way as smart as jared was he was still a child and didnthave his father remarkable skills when it came to wizardry and he had his mother intelligence the child was not to be underestimated but magus had cut the boy neck before and nearly slit his throat in the process the scar was inflicted with a metal that afflicted the blood itself it was the muggle blood kept the child alive ron had to stay alive magus wanted him to live long enough to feel the pain and the loss of his family the mistake was separating them and sending jared away magus needed him for bait and he was going to make sure he would get to the boy it was only a matter of time jared was cut off from his family now the one person that magus underestimated was ron he had no idea that ron had come up with a plan that was going to derail magus the case file was waiting in the trunk in the false bottom that was going to be the key to end it professor de luca received a message through his fireplace he got to his feet and read it with that he went up to gryffindor tower he knew the password to get inside and walked up to the boys dorm he found jared fast asleep jared he said as gently as he could professor de luca what time is it asked jared it still early it only eight why are you sleeping right now asked professor de luca i was feeling tired whispered jared why are you here to check your trunk jared got up and went to his trunk and opened it what are you looking for your father sent a message it was the only chance he had check the bottom that what he wrote jared pulled all his things out and felt for the false bottom i put things in there already why would there be anything else i would have noticed if there was his eyes widened as he pulled out a thick manila envelope okay this wasnthere before one of time travel confusing things isntit asked professor de luca yeah i starting to get a headache from all of this answered jared he opened the envelope i dontbelieve this it the case file he actually sent the case file it was a lot thicker than jared thought it would be the file was organized chronologically some of it was typed using an old0 fashion typewriter some in using a quick quill and other part were handwritten by ron hand jared felt sick to his stomach when he saw one of the crime photos of one of the victims for a split second he thought it was a doll but it was a little girl he quickly put the whole contents back into the envelope do you mind if i take a look asked professor de luca let take it to professor dumbledore office jared nodded but he refused to hand it over to him i not giving it to you right now it was meant for me the only other hands it will go back to are ron s the dada professor nodded obligingly and stepped outside the dorm room jared changed quickly and met him out in the common room they made their way to the headmaster office and saw that professor dumbledore was waiting for them jared took a seat so did professor de luca i have the case file said jared shouldntwe wait until they get back i think it would be more prudent for us to take a look at this now said professor dumbledore jared handed him the envelope this is heavy observed the headmaster as he opened it and started to leaf through the contents your father spent a good three years hunting this man down it started the year i started here confirmed jared my godfather might have taken the position as the new dada professor to keep a closer eye on me now that i think of it i remember one night on my first week here i was so homesick but at the same time horribly intimidated my parents are tough acts to follow everyone was expecting greatness out of me immediately i went into one of the halls to look at some of the trophies imagine seeing your father name on a quidditch plaque and thinking you had to match it uncle harry found me at first i thought i was in big trouble because he was mad at me for wandering around in the dead of night but then he mellowed out so suddenly it was relief relief that nothing happened to me it started prior to your start at hogwarts professor dumbledore corrected magus had sent pictures of you and your mother outside your house in london he knew where you two were at all times he sent pictures of you and your mother to remind your father oh said jared as he visibly paled this case consumed your father for three years professor dumbledore looked up at jared and looked closely at him you were the last victim according to this case file he picked up a photograph that was taken two years ago in jared time and handed it him that was the final straw here an account of how your father captured magus jared took the photo in his hand it was him it had been taken at the hospital it must have been taken right after the attack his lips were blue while the rest of his skin was pale he had bruising around his neck on one side while the cut was on the other he flipped it over and saw that his father had written jared ronald weasley 13 survivor jared noticed that the first writing was handwritten while the last word was printed out in capital letters i part of the case file whispered jared the second to last part said professor dumbledore your father hunted him down to an old abbey and finished him off in a graveyard your father almost killed him but brought him in the case file concludes with the court proceedings and the outcome magus was sentenced to life imprisonment in azkaban the only reason why he was kept alive was because he never revealed where all the bodies were buried he should have killed him when he had the bloody chance said jared softly his natural accent came out and he sounded close to tears he seemed to tremble i forgot about it i didntwant to remember it the blade that he used was coated in poison a poison that would have killed a pureblood almost instantly but lucky for you the cold water slowed the toxin as well as your muggle blood you had to undergo a full transfusion your blood was filtered out of your body and the toxin was taken out magus had a dagger that he attempted to kill your father with but your father used it and stabbed him instead it ended up not killing him which means that magus is probably a half blood as well that was how he was able to stop him i dontunderstand said jared as his anger surged how could he go around killing muggles and thinking that any muggle born witch or wizard or half blood inferior when he one too who he to decide who deserves to live or die look at my neck this is permanent if my parents could have gotten rid of it they would have it twitches from time to time hate is hardly ever logical as for the twitch that probably the toxin you re suffering from some kind of relapse from it said professor dumbledore professor de luca asked did you ever have to take extra potions here and there jared jared nodded yes i had to go to madame pomfrey everyday for the past two years to get some kind of potion i tried to ask at first why and what it was but my godfather said that it was because of the accident what happened to me wasntan accident i cantbelieve this they lied to me my parents my godfather even my best friends lied to me his voice echoed in the office he was getting paler and paler did you stop taking that potion recently asked professor de luca eventually i didnthave to go to the infirmary anymore to take it i was given the potion to take on my own but i didntpack it when i was coming here i left it back in my room in my parents house i ve been fine for months now but i must have started to relapse again that not in the file said professor dumbledore he got to his feet take this all of this back and go to madame pomfrey s i want you to give her a blood sample and tell her to give the results to me i would say to forward it to your parents but that wouldntbe a good idea thank you professor said jared as he got to his feet and walked out of the office when the door closed professor de luca asked do you suppose he ll be telling his father about this probably not answered professor dumbledore an jared is having some problems here he hasntreally gotten fully cured from the poison and like most teenagers he thinks he invisible he also pretty mad at his parents and harry at this point he didntreally tell ron that he was mad about that but this will probably keep him from telling ron about the possible relapse kirikarin livejournal com take out the spaces disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty seven time up things were worse off than jared would have predicted madame pomfrey was so alarmed after she had finished doing an analysis of his blood that she was insistent that jared stay until classes started up again jared reluctantly agreed professor de luca just sent back a message that the case file had arrived madame pomfrey sent the results back to professor dumbledore while professor mcgonagall dropped by to see to jared she must have been told about the situation because she kind enough not to ask any questions she merely told him that if things got too much for him that he had an excuse not to go to class and that she would cover for him that only served to make jared more anxious because it seemed so much more serious jared got well enough to get out of the infirmary and return to the dorms apparently the kind of blood poisoning he had hadntoccurred to anyone else yet what he didntknow was that snape and dumbledore were looking further into it jared was given nothing in the meantime he was able to get enough rest and felt safer in the infirmary than he did in the dorms alone madame pomfrey kept him far from a window at his request and sealed off that corner with the curtain he had heard malfoy come in with some kind of injury from practicing quidditch but other than that nothing else when he was released back to the dorms he checked his assignments again and waited for everyone else to come back during this time he had time to think about what ron had said about keeping himself it just made jared angrier when he thought about it the first creature to greet him when they had returned was crookshanks who immediately came up to jared and rubbed against his legs hey crookshanks it been a while since i ve seen you he whispered he resisted the urge to pick up crookshanks it good to see all of you i hope you enjoyed the rest of your holiday it almost came out mechanical happy new year jared greeted hermione as she walked up to him she immediately noticed that something was wrong with him no one could ever accuse hermione maternal instincts you look kind of pale are you all right i ve been staying up late answered jared he couldntreally stay mad at her so how did the rest of your holiday go nothing much answered ron harry added we finished the assignments no thanks to you but hermione saved us jared smirked of course what about you ginny things got a little boring after you left she admitted she looked at him a little more closely hermione right you do look a bit peaky are you sure you re all right jared nodded as he picked up crookshanks hermione didnteven try to stop him as he continued to pay more attention to the feline than to anyone else he settled on the sofa with crookshanks on his lap i was five when my family pet died i was so upset about it my dad offered to get me another cat but i said that it wouldntbe the same things didntimprove until he brought home a little african gray hatchling that was found in an illegal animal raid i was ten it was just a baby too my dad found a way for me to keep him he my familiar which is just right for a wizard those things live for like a hundred years easy what his name asked ginny paolo answered jared i hope that my parents are looking after him i sure they are said ron he too was noticing that jared didntlook any better than he did before hermione watched silently she looked more closely at the way that jared held on to crookshanks he seemed to know exactly how to hold him hermione looked closely at jared hands his fingers she smiled at him jared why dontyou just keep crookshanks with you for right now he seems to like you a whole lot and you must miss home in america for a bit how were your relatives they were all right but you re right i did miss my parents answered jared everyone else was gathering back at the dorms and soon dinner rolled around he went to dinner with them and hoped that malfoy and his cronies wouldntsay anything about jared being there he had to make sure that they wouldntsay that he was there for christmas he sat next to ron who was next to hermione he kept to himself and was withdrawn it wasntuntil everyone else had gone to bed that jared was able to talk to ron and harry about the case file when everyone else was fast asleep jared took the envelope and started down the stairs with ron and harry following behind him when they got to the table he merely dropped the envelope and let it slide to them ron was the first one to open it and it was in order jared didntsay much as they read through it harry looked at some of the pictures and nearly reeled back from them you do learn how to take really good notes ron he pointed out a good thing too said ron as he read the file closely god there isnta word to really describe magus other than disgusting jared said harry softly he looked at jared who was sitting absolutely still are you sure you re all right i mean being alone here must have done something to you i had time to think of a few things he said softly harry glanced at ron jared continued like how you all lied to me for three years about what really happened to me all of you even you harry you even got my best friends to lie to me to keep this from me he got up i going to bed do whatever you what jared said ron as he got up dontgo like this i really tired dad retorted jared i have to get some rest ron was about to go after him when harry placed the picture of jared on the table in his viewing ron froze when he saw it he reached out and touched it he looks dead in this harry he said i cantlet anything happen to him not even here he pulled out hermione diary and took out the picture that he had been looking at from time to time ever since he got the diary back ron put the picture of baby jared with his mother next to the picture of a nearly dead jared i know what he going through said harry i know what it like to have secrets kept from me things that are important to my life arentjust told to me but i can see why it sometimes it for the best ron flipped to that part of the case file he noticed that it was handwritten and that as it went along he must have gotten tired but he had done it all in one seating ron could picture himself sitting next to his son bed writing this report for the case file watching every breath ron read in greater detail how the treatment for the poison was done the whole thing sounded very clinical professional to start with but eventually dwelled down to a very personal account the next part of the case file was an arrest report given by himself ron read how he had done it he had gone toe to toe with magus knowing that he if he had been stabbed or cut he would have died it didntmatter he had do whatever it took to keep his son safe the arrest date indicated that it was a day before jared had regained consciousness to be frank ron would have never believed that he had the courage to do something like that but seeing jared made him believe it there you have it said harry you didntkill him though and i dontintend to said ron firmly he killed lots of people if i kill him then i not any better you had the right idea before harry about not letting sirius and remus kill wormtail i wouldntgive him that satisfaction let go to sleep sure agreed harry when they had gotten to the room jared had already drawn his curtains ron went up to the window and not to his surprise he saw that the raven was perched on a tree branch watching them he looked straight at it for a while before it flew away ron went to bed without drawing the window curtains closed leaving the room bathed in moonlight classes resumed the following morning so everyone was up ready early all the assignments were turned in and everything seemed to settle for the moment jared was still rather sore at ron and harry which ron couldntquite understand ron chalked it up to jared taking after his mother not knowing that jared ability to hold a grudge came from him hermione was actually quite concerned about jared behavior towards her best friends although jared was still perfectly nice and sweet to her which was a mystery to her ron and harry were still trying to get him to talk to them but he had refused how he was managing to keep it up was really a marvel to hermione she did observe from time to time during the first week back that jared had gone to see madame pomfrey when jared didntshow up for a da meeting hermione voiced her concerns to harry and ron i saw jared coming out of the infirmary today is it me or is he getting worse he was coming out of the infirmary asked ron as he glanced at her hermione nodded do you want me to find out what going on with him since he obviously mad at the both of you for something that i dontknow about yeah agreed ron reluctantly it was jared idea in the first place not to tell her who he really was so ron was sure that jared would keep his identity a secret ron also wanted to know why jared was looking so ill just be careful all right be careful about what asked hermione jared wouldnthurt me even you should know that by now and i dont think he interested in me i know that said ron understanding her meaning i just dontwant you upsetting him anymore than he is already now who fault is it that he upset retorted hermione harry chose not to say anything to him this was an argument between parents come to think of it jared had gone out of his way earlier to cause ron a lot of agitation harry just listened to him and wondered if his parents would have been having any discussions like this one harry shifted uncomfortably as hermione awaited ron answer who was sort of looking a way from her does it really matter who fault it is asked harry breaking the silence maybe he not mad at all he might be acting this way because he doesntfeel well he not going to tell ron and me because he doesntfeel like it he might tell you hermione depending on how you ask where is jared asked ron noticing that he wasntthere he looked at his sister expectantly but she was in the middle of reviewing her textbook ginny he prodded where is jared jared she asked barely looking up oh i haventseen him in here he might have gone to madame pomfrey again said hermione as she got to her feet i ll go and get him you two wait here she didntallow them to say anything and the common room was too crowed for either of them to talk to each other about the situation hermione had a bad feeling about the whole thing she didntknow exactly why she was so concerned about jared well being but he looked so sick that she had to do something he was definitely hiding something more than he normally was there was always an air of mystery surrounding him she made her way to the infirmary and stopped at the doorway as she heard jared talking with madame pomfrey it just getting worse said madame pomfrey you may have to stay here if you feel any worse i wish you would explain to me why you re so ill i looking at your blood test and it seems that the problem is in your blood jared said i know i dontwant to stay here i ve had my fill of hospitals madame pomfrey i spent weeks at st mungo before he sounded frustrated as if he had had the same conversation with the nurse before you should have brought the potion you were taking with you or at least the formula for it i might have been able to make it here chided madame pomfrey i never had a relapse before i thought i didntneed it he said he then said impatiently can i go now sure but come back professor dumbledore and professor snape may have something for you the headmaster is a renowned alchemist he might come up with something yet answered madame pomfrey now if you feel any worse just come back here and stay over night again thank you madame pomfrey hermione mind was reeling at what she had heard she quickly dashed far enough down the hall so that he wouldntnoticed she saw that he wasntwalking back down towards the tower instead jared walked purposefully towards the exit of the class classes were done for the day but he was headed outside she went right after him knowing full well where he was headed it was still cold out and the snow threatened to fall again yet jared pressed on until he made it to the tree jared called out hermione jared he turned around and seemed startled hermione what are you doing out here he asked you re not all right are you i went to go find you she answered she felt guilt about listening in on a private conversation i heard you talking to madame pomfrey but there something i dontunderstand okay there are a lot of things i dontunderstand first off why did you just tell madame pomfrey that you were in st mungo before when this is the first time you ve ever been here have you been lying to everyone the whole time her eyes were penetrating only she could make him feel guilty like this he felt weak as he leaned against the tree for support i cantexplain it all to you he was breathing hard he looked at the lake and felt the air chill him to the bone but you re not wrong about it not being any of your business because it is partly jared just tell me what happening to you you look so sick pleaded hermione gently just tell me what wrong jared felt his neck tingling it hurts he moaned it burning he was heaving hermione reached out her hand and lifted his chin up slightly she could see the scar along his neck but it wasnta scar any longer it was now red and it looked like it blood was going to break through his eyes were nearly closed his body felt heavy hermione pulled her hand back and that was when she saw the blood on her fingertips oh my god she whispered we have to get you back to the infirmary mum whispered jared he opened his eyes for a moment he saw the raven diving down mum look out he shouted in horror hermione turned around and saw a man standing in front of them she instinctively threw herself between the man and jared foolish boy whispered the man you came back in a time where your father is incapable of defending you stay away from him shouted hermione as she drew her wand i wontlet you hurt him the man walked up to her you are exactly who i want right now he pointed his wand at her come with me now and nothing will happen to him hermione no dontdo it gasped jared hermione glanced back at him dont worry everything is going to be all right she paused i understand now she turned her attention back to the man you gave me your word that you wonthurt him she walked up to him as she ran her fingers through one part of her hair letting something drop to the ground jared was getting weaker and weaker no dontgo he whimpered as everything went dark ron and harry were working on their assignments and had lost track of time it wasntuntil they came across a question they couldntanswer that they realized how long hermione was gone harry do you have the answer to question eleven no dontyou they looked at each other and then ron reached for hermione assignment she had been ahead off them but she had stopped at number ten hermione been gone for a while now pointed out harry ron was already on his feet yeah let go and look for them ron ron was already out the door as harry followed closely behind them i should have gone with her he said as he took fast strides towards the infirmary something happened you dontknow that insisted harry i sure they re all right when they got to the infirmary the found madame pomfrey doing some paperwork at her desk she looked up at them as the walked in what seems to be the trouble she asked where hermione and jared asked ron i haventsee miss granger all day but i just had a consolation with mr blake answered madame pomfrey he left ten minutes ago did you see which way he went asked ron madame pomfrey shook her head no i afraid not mr weasley ron didntsay anything as he dashed out of the infirmary harry said very quickly thank you madame pomfrey ron wait up ron didntknow where he was going he felt panicked as he looked around ron hang on a second said harry forcefully i ve got the map let go someplace where no one can see us so we can find out exactly where they are ron nodded and followed harry into a more private part of the hall ron looked around to make sure that no one was listening to them harry pointed his wand at the map and said i am serious up to no good the map immediately began to show and they looked at it they re not in the castle they re no where in the castle said ron where the bloody hell are they harry looked at the map they re outside jared out by the tree by the lake wait i canttell where hermione is let go and get jared he might know where she gone said ron he immediately started for outside as harry said mischief managed he folded up the map and followed ron out of the castle ron started running full tilt as soon as they were outside harry could only run after him ron stopped cold as he saw jared lying face up in the snow there was some blood as ron walked up slowly and got down to him what happened he whispered he saw something lying on the snow it was one of the combs that ron had given hermione for christmas and there were some errant black feathers he picked up one of them and the comb harry stood still holding his breath as ron reached his hand out and check jared pulse he alive he sounded somewhat relieved harry help me get him up harry nodded and came on the other side to help support jared he took her managed jared she gone time is going to really run out now ron stopped and said we ll find her in time he tried to sound sure of himself he and harry had to get jared to the infirmary you dontget it whispered jared he didntlook up at ron but something else my hand fading harry looked at ron he getting lighter he observed the blood stains that was on your clothes are gone he right something happening to hermione ron shifted all of jared weight over to harry harry get jared into the infirmary give me the map i have to go and find her you stay with him go now ron didntgive harry much of a choice because he was already leaving before he had a chance to say anything harry felt the weight of jared against his shoulder he could feel it changing from lighter to heavy he could feel the life fading from him harry used all the strength he had to keep going back into the castle time was now really running out an by the time jared is attacked professor dumbledore would be dead jared in real trouble and so is hermione ron is about to go into a fight that he not prepared for he going into this with two lives to fight for other than his this marks it towards the climax and the story is ending soon kirikarin livejournal com take out the spaces disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty eight confrontation ron had no idea where he was going the map was having difficult tracing hermione which rendered it almost useless he had only a feather and a comb to go by as clues he was going to have to find hermione soon or she and jared would be gone he kept going until he was at the edge of the forbidden forest it was the first time that he had ever even considered entering it alone he noticed the trail seemed to end at the edge he realized that he was walking straight into a trap squaring his shoulders he looked around him he decided that it was best to announce his arrival i here shouted ron as loud as he could come and show yourself if you want me come and get me the raven swooped from a tree and magus transformed as he came down he landed perfectly on his feet ron forced himself to stand his ground he didnteven have his wand drawn yet where is she demanded ron where did you put her by now you would have noticed your whelp fading away weasley i ve been waiting for you to come ron looked at him he had white hair that hung down to his back he had clear colorless eyes his skin was as pale as the snow surrounding them i know what you are and what you did said ron and i donthave any time nor the tolerance to deal with you you want to hurt me why didntyou just come right after me i take greater pleasure in watching you suffer than hurting you directly weasley said magus you ruined my life i ll ruin your life ron boldly corrected you couldntstop me in the future that why you had to come back here when you think i donthave any skill at all you are nothing i couldnt understand how a no one like you could have stopped me ron drew his wand that because i more than that i am going to ask you only one more time where is hermione she around answered magus as he drew his wand i doubt you know how to use that wand as well as you do later on you d be surprise at what i can do retorted ron expelliarmus harry wouldntallow them to throw him out of the infirmary as soon as he dropped jared off there he insisted on staying as madame pomfrey went to work the only thing she could do to get rid of him was to send him off to go and get professor dumbledore harry stood there just looking at what they were doing professor snape joined them as professor de luca started to question harry about what had happened harry wasntgiving any good answers because he was watching as professor snape and the headmaster were assisting madame pomfrey she had managed to stop the bleeding but they were now administering something else it looked they were going to have jared blood taken and cleaned out like what had been done to him before they were having so much difficult because jared was fading in and out ron out there professor de luca which way did he go harry he went towards the forest said harry nearly sounding frantic i didntexactly which way he went but i had to bring jared here hermione in trouble cantyou see that how can you stand here and ask questions his parents are in trouble you have to get out there and help ron i promised ron that i wouldntleave jared i cantleave him harry glanced over at jared for a moment as he thought about what he had to do the thought of losing his friends was overwhelming he had to do something anything to keep them alive it hasntsnowed yet there should still be some tracks professor de luca nodded he glanced at professor snape who was freed up for a moment severus come with me harry you stay here i not going anywhere said harry firmly professor snape looked to professor dumbledore for a moment who gave a nod go severus you ve already done you work on the potion i will remain here harry you can help me come on hold jared down once the blood has been cleaned enough the treatment i ve devised will be very painful you ll need to hold him down harry nodded and walked up to the bed he touched jared hand and felt how cold it was professor dumbledore gave him enough room to get up close enough it going to be all right jared i here i not going anywhere but you ve got to stay with me too dontleave he whispered you ve made it this far you ve got to keep fighting ron wasntable to get the wand away from magus who was threw a spell at him ron was able to block it he pulled back away from him i wasntfoolish enough to keep any daggers with poison lying around weasley no i have learned from my mistakes obviously you haventlearned enough retorted ron flipedo he was going to have to come up with something he thought back to all the lessons that year with professor de luca and all the da meetings he remembered how harry told him some of the things he was learning from professor snape after finding out that someone was after him ron started pouring over the books that harry he had to come up with a plan and he had to do it fast the spell had succeeded in knocking magus off his feet by flipping him over magus got back on his feet he was bleeding from the mouth you are right about one thing weasley the longer it takes to fight me the less you have a chance of saving her and if i dead then there no way you ll find her in time you will tell me where she is or so help me i will do what i have to get what i want snarled ron i wontlet you kill her and jared you re not taking my family away from me he flicked his wand and arrows spewed out of it nearly hitting magus you are a coward you re trying to kill off the muggles because you are one that the worst part of it you hate yourself so much that you want to destroy everything i wontlet you win let see if you can cast any spells without a voice to magus surprise ron came up to him faster than he could have imagined up till this point ron was pulling back defensively silencio shouted ron using a jabbing motion with his wand magus pulled back he opened his mouth to speak and grabbed at his throat i dontneed you to have a voice to tell me where hermione is he gripped the wrist of magus causing him to drop his wand as soon as magus had dropped his wand ron grabbed him by the throat making his eyes practically pop out of their sockets ron whispered with his wand pointed at magus chest legilimens just as ron had expected magus wasntexpecting that from him ron braced himself for what was going to happen he had never done that to anyone before and never really had a chance to practice it he had to get past all the horrible and disturbing images that were in embedded in the mind of a murder ron felt it overwhelming him until he got to a point where he had to get what he wanted where are you taking me asked hermione what is it that you want what about jared this isntabout you or your whelp spat magus this is about his father you are just bait to draw him out when i am done with him he ll have nothing left then i ll kill him hermione was afraid as she continued walking then as they got to the edge of the forest she broke off running she wasntgoing to get very far magus transformed into his animagus form and took flight above her he landed right in front of her she screamed and pulled out her wand stay away from me she shouted it over now you will comply said magus as he pointed his wand at her chest imperio hermione struggled to fight it but magus used his wand and said more forcefully imperio you see i not concerned about azkaban because i already have a life sentence there thanks to him he didnteven have the courtesy of killing me and i thought he was the only one worthy of the game what a disappointment he an embarrassment to his pureblood class marrying out and bring forth an abomination i will purge the world of such weakness come magus led hermione along towards the lake he put the bubble head charm on her head and used his wand to cut a hole in the ice jump in he whispered into her ear hermione body moved slowly and she walked right into the hole and sunk under if the charm doesntbreak you ll freeze to death in the water but if it does then you ll drown either way i get what i want he used his wand to seal up the ice ron released magus from his grip i wontgive you the satisfaction of killing you but i wontlet you ever hurt anyone again he said all you ll have is time with that ron pulled at the chain that was around magus neck and got the time turner i ll see to that he let it drop to the ground and crushed it under his feet he heard the sound of foot steps coming up to him he turned around and let go of magus completely he saw professor snape and professor de luca coming up to him you can have him said ron i need to go to hermione ron took off running as fast as he could he had to get back to the lake worst yet it was starting to snow he wouldntbe able to see the trail much longer he kept going until he reached the lake the more shallow parts were completely froze over ron had to figure out where hermione was under the ice hermione shouted ron at the top of his lungs hermione come on show me where you are a thought came to him he pulled out the comb that was still in his pocket he didntmention it but he had bought the combs in diagon alley the salesperson told him that the comb would light up to find its pair if they were separated it wasntglowing before but ron covered it with his hand which was getting colder and colder come on show me where your partner is he whispered come on there was still light out it was too bright to see anything ron put his wand away for the moment and covered his other hand so that he could see it was glowing now ron looked around searching for a light blue glow he walked along the edge and looked as hard as he could then he suddenly saw it there was a faint blue light not too far from him he went up to the ice and drew his wand he used a spell to blast through the ice ron pulled off his out of cloak and jumped into the water lumos he lit his wand before he went under the water so that he could find her faster he dove under the water immediately feeling the cold he swam as deep as he could looking all round he saw the blue light he saw that she was tangled among the weeds the bubble head charm was still in place but he knew that she must have been nearly frozen ron swam up to her and tried to pull her from the weeds but he couldntget her loose he saw the bubble head charm flicker out bubbles were escaping from her lips his eyes widened and he pressed his mouth against hers and forced air through he swam back up and took a deep breath he swam back down and pressed his lips against hers again then went back up he used his wand to make a bubble head for himself before going back down a third time ron went down to hermione legs seeing that it was her cloak that was caught on the weeds he went back up to her neck and freed her from her cloak he pulled her close and swam upwards when he got to the top he burst through and took off the bubble head charm she wasntbreathing he carried her out of the water completely hermione he said as he checked her pulse he pointed his wand at her and said ennervate the spell didntwork she wasnt breathing come on breathe come on he pleaded he grabbed his cloaked and wrapped around her ice cold body professor de luca was headed towards them he had snape bring magus back to the castle ron you found her shouted de luca is she alive her pulse is slowly she not breathing i gave her some air while we were under the water answered ron anxiously do something you need to keep breathing for her i ll do the chest compressions instructed professor de luca professor snape has gone back to the castle he should be alerting someone to come and help us he adjusted hermione body and further instructed you will give her three breaths and i will do the compressions we ll alternate until she either regains consciousness or we get some help ron nodded and they started they went on for three tries until hermione started to respond she started cough and ron pulled away from her ron she asked what going on it all right you re all right answered ron as held on to her we re going back to the castle now what happened to the man what about jared asked hermione he wonthurt you anymore answered ron jared going to be fine he picked her up and suddenly felt cold but his cloak was around her instead professor de luca urged let go back before we get completely covered in snow ron nodded as hermione closed her eyes again professor de luca led them back to the castle as ron kept hermione steady when they got to the castle the other students were getting ready to go down to dinner ginny eyes widened as she saw her brother carrying hermione what happened asked ginny we have to go to the infirmary answered ron i ll tell you later did you find jared asked ginny after him as she started to follow him to the infirmary oh my god what going on madame pomfrey looked at ron as he stared at what was going on with jared harry was holding down his shoulders as his body shook professor dumbledore was pouring some more potion down jared throat set her down on a bed over there ordered madame pomfrey ron hesitated for a moment but did as he was done what going on with jared what are you doing to him demanded ron mr weasley you re soaking wet come here insisted madame pomfrey she took a blanket out and wrapped it around him ron struggled against her i ll get some potions for both you you lay down i dontneed to lay down said ron defiantly he asked again what are you doing to him saving his life answered professor dumbledore i have figured out what will cure him he didnttell you that he had a relapse of the blood poisoning did he he wasnt taking the potion that he was supposed to be taking regularly in order to keep this from happening he didnteven have a sample of it ron eyes widened as he jaw dropped he felt ginny tugging at his arm ron you need to get some rest you can tell us what happened later please he let ginny guide him to a bed next to hermione madame pomfrey came and gave him some pepperup potion along with hermione who went right back to sleep professor dumbledore drew the curtains close to keep ron from watching ginny stayed by her brother side as they waited i guess you found him and he dealt with him too said professor snape mr weasley have you ever done that before have you ever used legilimency before tonight no answered ron as he glanced at hermione can we talk about this someplace else ron are you sure you can get around right now asked ginny you should change your clothes yes said ron as he got off the bed i ll change my clothes and meet you at your classroom professor snape ginny stay here and if anything happens come and get me she chose not to argue with him and just nodded ron went all the way back to the dorms and changed clothes ignoring all the strange looks at him he went straight back to the dungeons and saw that not only professor snape was waiting for him but so was professor de luca and professor dumbledore where did you put him asked ron where d you put magus we put him in one of the towers but i doubt he will be able to do anything replied professor snape now will you answer my question mr weasley ron nodded and looked away from him for a moment i never did it until tonight he answered i never even had a chance to practice it i just had to do it do you have any idea how difficult it is to do that type of spell asked professor de luca especially at your age and skill level without any practice of any kind did you take off the silencing charm i put on him asked ron did you i did but it wontdo him any good to speak when you went into his mind you stayed for too long when you do this type of magic you only gather what you can see and what you can correctly interpret what you did was so deep that you scrambled him from the inside explained professor snape ron swallowed i didntknow that the thing is that one never knows how long a person will stay like that said professor dumbledore you took his time turner didntyou i destroyed it he stuck replied ron coldly he didntgive me much of a choice he wanted me to kill him and i didntwant to do that what will become of him now we will find a place to put him said professor dumbledore he will most likely be placed in st mungo in the ward for mental illness but as professor snape pointed out he could come out of it at any moment then we ll have to come up with something more permanent said professor de luca we ll have to do a mind wipe professor snape nodded in agreement the headmaster looked at ron and said you may go now thank you said ron and he exited the room as soon as he was gone professor dumbledore turned his attention back to his fellow teachers he observed it seems that ron weasley will be a very powerful auror when he comes of age they nodded and soon left an harry chooses to stay with jared it is something that links up to how his relationship with his own godfather was like ron has come through but jared survival is yet to be determined but the story is almost done ron was rather severe with what he did to magus and even if ron doesntget the satisfaction of magus remembering what he has done at least he ll be gone kirikarin livejournal com take out the spaces disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter twenty nine at the beginning hermione regained coconsciousness the following morning and woke up to see that ron and harry were waiting for her where am i she asked as she tried to sit up what happened you re in the infirmary answered ron gently it been almost twelve hours since everything happened you want to know what been going on or did you figure it out yourself harry gave hermione a gentle smile not giving her a chance to answer you gave us quite a scare hermione we were wondering if you were ever going to wake up and before you ask jared fine he stable he said ginny interrupted them ron mum and dad are here and so are bill charlie fred and george what asked ron as he turned why i dontbelieve this i already handled it and didntcome out of it with a scratch and still they all come at once what up with this he got up and left as harry took the chair he had just occupied to get closer to he not giving her a chance to answerrmione i know that you said jared was fine but where is he asked hermione he still resting answered harry he quite a fighter but you know probably already knew that hermione smiled a little did i mention that i haventeaten in hours she asked harry would you mind getting me something to eat sure said harry as he got to his feet i ll be right back i know how to get to the kitchens he walked by all the weasleys and went out the door hermione couldnthear what they were talking about but ron was getting some kind of lecture from his parents she wanted to figure out what they were talking about but her wand was out of her reach so she couldntuse it to listen in on their conversation she didntwant to summon it to her ron i so glad that you re all right said molly as she gave him a rib crushing hug when i heard something happened i felt like my heart was going to stop dontyou ever worry me like that again now molly you know that he cantkeep that promise to you said arthur he going to be an auror i think you handled yourself pretty well son he sounded very proud of him which was something that ron wasntused to thanks dad said ron as he felt his cheeks burn molly asked what about jared how is he professor dumbledore said that he was so sick he fine now professor dumbledore did what the healers couldntdo before which is come up with a cure for him why dontwe go and check up on him asked ron hermione awake too but she ll want to hear how he doing does she know ventured bill curiously charlie and the twins had the same questioning looks on their faces ginny was looking at ron expectantly i mean did he tell her or did you tell her i didnttell her anything i dont know if she really knows or not if she does then this will be a first for her usually she knows things before anyone else answered ron let go see jared and ask hermione watched the weasleys go towards corner where jared was supposedly resting but when ron drew the curtain the bed was empty where d he go asked ron madame pomfrey where is jared where jared she asked as she walked up to the corner why he right here she paused when she noticed that the bed was empty and was made he must have snuck off when he had the chance i should have restrained him to the bed he probably would have figured out how to get out said hermione loudly calling attention to herself but i think i know where he gone if i tell you ron will you tell me what been going on ron looked sheepish for a moment as he thought about it and nodded sure why not so where d he go the tree by the lake answered hermione simply i would have thought that you would have known it his favorite spot in hogwarts if you dontfind him on the ground he probably on one of the branches the rest of you can go and look for him while ron stays and tells me what i want to know let go said fred i know a shortcut i coming along honestly doesnt he know that he could break his neck if he falls off that tree he such a hand full said molly arthur why dontyou talk to him what makes you think he going to listen to me he barely listens to ron answered arthur let all go and find him and leave these two alone said molly ginny reluctantly followed the rest of the family outside madame pomfrey sensed that she should make herself busy if you need me i ll be in the storage closet checking the inventory we ve gone through a lot of supplies in the past couple of days ron turned his attention to hermione completely as soon as madame pomfrey was out the door he walked back up to her bed and took the seat he had previously he was extremely nervous as she sat up a bit more so what do you want to know he asked trying to get this over with as soon as possible oh nothing much said hermione musingly as she looked him straight in eye she narrowed her brown eyes like when were you going to tell me that jared was our son ah yeah that right i got it it was all in front of me all along and i noticed how much he was like us i just didntput it together because it didntmake any sense to me not until he called me mum went on hermione so were you really just going to go on and say nothing you could have told me she grabbed his arm well what do you have to say for yourself i was going to tell you said ron as he laughed nervously she glared at him i swear he didntwant me to say anything and you went along with it asked hermione as she pulled the pillow from behind her she started to hit ron over the head with it you should have told me anyway what was your problem how could you keep this from me ron managed to wrestle the pillow away from her and pinned her arms down on the bed that hurt he told her i didntwant to tell you because i didnt want you freaking out and after what you did i was right i only mad because you didnttell me said hermione and what more you ve been lying to me the whole time and so has he you re a bad influence on him arentyou i glad that you re feeling a lot better ron said as he leaned in closer to her face i dontknow what i d do without you you ll be giving me a lot so are you going to tell me anything else that happened i want to know everything from the point when you figured out who jared really was it a long story said ron as he settled back you should get comfortable for this actually ginny was the first one to figure out who he was then harry and then me jared already knew that the other weasleys were arriving he was pretty sure of it because he knew how the family worked he saw them coming from the tree he didntdo his normal climb up but levitated upwards to his favorite branch he was entirely surprise either when molly glanced up at him with an exasperated expression jared ronald weasley come down here this instant before you fall off and break your neck she demanded hmm well i thinking about it jared do you want me to call your father out here molly was really mad at him now fred and george were snickering because they couldntlaugh out loud arthur shook his head while bill and charlie worn huge grins on his faces jared looked around and saw that ron and harry werentthere he sighed rolled his eyes and jumped down landing on his feet he winced because the impact was harder than he normally would have expected ello everyone he greeted he asked molly who told you my whole name i guessed said molly are you sure you re fine you shouldntbe up in that tree like that you could have gotten hurt i fine i made of hardy stock insisted jared i get enough lectures at home i dontneed them here we re all glad to see that you re all right said arthur we dontknow everything that happened but from what professor dumbledore told us you were pretty close to the brink he a miracle worker said jared with a smile as he stretched out his arms i haventfelt this good in a while he said that i wonthave to worry about taking any more potions and that a good thing my dad wonthave to worry so much when i play quidditch at school since you re still here talking to us hermione hasntkilled ron for not telling her anything said charlie with a laugh ginny also said your scar is still there professor dumbledore said it permanent but you shouldntbe feeling anything else from it now it not just him it was professor snape as well jared nodded and shrugged he finds me obnoxiously smart in class but i should thank him for his work on it so where are ron and harry dontknow where harry went said fred george added your dad had to stay with your mum she was the one who told us where to find you and she d only tell us if he stayed and explained what happened but like charlie said you re still here so she done anything too permanent to him yet why dontwe get you back to bed asked molly you really are like your father you re just trouble waiting to happen hey you wonthave to worry as much as my parents do that the grand part of being a grandparent pointed out jared and you didnthave to bring everyone out here with you i would have gone back i just had to make sure said molly arthur wrapped his arm around molly shoulders let go back inside it cold out here i sure that your parents are almost done talking he urged let go back to the tower said jared i have to start packing what i came here to do is over now i have to get back to my own time my parents will probably be mad at me for not listening to them but i think i d rather come back and stop their worrying than making it any longer than it has to be when do you plan on leaving asked arthur he sounded as disappointed as the others looked it didntoccur to anyone that jared would be leaving soon after they had just met him i ll be leaving as soon as hermione is out of the infirmary but dont worry you ll be seeing me again in no time granddad i ll be a lot smaller though and i wontbe talking for two years after until that but you ll love me just the same maybe we should enjoy those two years before you start talking teased ginny jared glared at her now if you dontmind telling us about our futures i would be even happier you haventbeen as nice to me as you should be so i not telling you a thing retorted jared besides that would be telling wouldntyou like to be surprise here a hint for the rest of you i the fifth grandchild and an only child you lucky boy said bill his siblings all glared at him he laughed no what i meant to say what that he got all the attention of his parents not that it a good thing hey i was the one out this group to be an only child if not for just a little bit i am never really lonely said jared my cousins keep me company but it nice having a set of grandparents i donthave to share with anyone else god my dad probably going to kill me when i get back of course my mum would never let him get away with it they stopped at the fat lady leaping toadstools he said and the portrait swung open with delay they stepped inside and since it was the middle of the day there wasntanyone else in there i ll just rest for now look cajoled fred as he sat next to jared i understand if you dontwant to tell ginny anything because she hasntbeen that nice to you and all after all she was the one who told us who you were it was one of the funniest things i ever saw but how about telling me and george about us my mum told me never to buy anything from your shops said jared because of your pranks i got three weeks detention with professor potter of course you put warnings on there absolving yourselves of any responsibility but who reads those things you said shops pointed out george and professor potter harry becomes a professor the defense against the dark arts professor and head of gryffindor he hardly lets me get away with anything where did harry go asked jared i went to go get something for hermione to eat but dropped it off with her and ron answered harry as he came down the stairs so you decided all by yourself to check out of the infirmary yes said jared it was boring and i hate hospitals and infirmaries your mum a healer pointed out harry he turned and greeted the weasleys hello everyone i ve been in and out of st mungo and that infirmary for the past three years of my life by the way thanks harry said jared i can always count on you harry didntexpress just how much jared helped him deal with the most recent loss in his life perhaps harry had learned something from that after all he was happy that he was able to help out even if he hadntdone the final moves that was all ron for the first harry got to see what it was like from ron perspective and it wasnta bad place to be so you ll be going soon said harry jared nodded everything is going to be all right hermione listened as ron explained everything from beginning to up to that moment they were only interrupted when harry came by with some food he left to get out of the line of fire because hermione looked rather mad at ron and harry really didntwant to get yelled at by her either ron continued talking as hermione ate some food so you could have given me better warning about someone coming after me said hermione as she finished eating you could have told me in the first place so i wouldnthave gone to that party in the second place and now i know that you kissed me just to get me to go along with you actually i would have kissed you anyway said ron with a grin he wasntblushing at all i guess we re going to have our hands full with jared wontwe definitely agreed hermione and i will remember this ron you have a lot to do to make up for it so dontthink you re off the hook i won t groaned ron are we done here hermione sat up more and leaned in and kissed him on the lips he smiled at her again and said you know i could get used this do you think they found him probably they haventbeen back yet so i assume they have answered hermione i would like to talk to him later on he was the one who gave me that last bit that i needed to figure out who he was so he called you mum when magus came asked ron at least he decided on his own to tell you you should get more rest you can talk to him when you feel better all right agreed hermione ron stood up and started to leave she added dontgo too far ron i would never be too far away from you he told her softly as he walked out as soon as he was out the door hermione whispered to herself i love you too another day passed before hermione was allowed to leave the infirmary madame pomfrey was happy to report that hermione had suffered no permanent damaged from her time in the water she let her go with a clean bill of help and everyone was happy that she was back there really wasntany explanation given and the weasleys had left before anyone had come out of class in the previous day jared stayed with ginny and harry while he waited for them to come so how are you feeling asked jared you should be fine hermione gave him a hug i fine i glad i so relieved said hermione so when are you going very soon neville interrupted them you re leaving jared jared nodded as the other people in the common room turned to look yes i ll be going soon the semester up i have to go home my parents are waiting for me as if on cue professor mcgonagall walked in it time for you to get going now jared will you guys walk me out asked jared turning to ron hermione harry and ginny they nodded ron and harry followed him upstairs and helped him with his trunk he had carefully packed everything up hermione knew that he had her completed diary but wasnttoo upset about it jared had the time turner on him but he had one more trick up his sleeve the three boys went down the stairs and the girls joined them professor mcgonagall led them to where they had to go professor mcgonagall stopped when they got to the quidditch pitch this is a good a place as any thank you professor you re welcome mr weasley said professor mcgonagall before taking leave of them jared turned his attention to them and sighed this isntreally good bye he told them you ll be seeing me again he smiled at them it might be too soon for you probably the first person who gave him a hug was ginny you re probably right about me waiting to see what comes after all it half the fun she admitted you take care of yourself she released him harry gave him a hug as well uncle harry dontdespair things will work out time will come when you wonthave to worry about staying alive having you here gave me that perspective so i am thankful that you came said harry ron was the next person that jared turned his attention to ron gave embraced him and held him longer than either harry or ginny he reluctantly released him so you re what i have to look forward to asked ron i guess it not as bad as i think it will be dontworry too much about not having any money dad said jared i got everything i need and you do good work and it your job to keep people like magus from spreading his hate it took me a while to understand that hermione was the last person he turned his attention to she never got a chance to talk to him like she had hoped she bit her lip as he hugged her she took a deep breath as she hugged him back he was near enough to her that she was able to give him a kiss on the cheek i cantwait for the day that i get to really met you i guess we ll just get more time together later on she told him before i go i wanted to show you this said jared as he pulled out the picture that me and you ron took the picture hermione took it in her hand and stared at it he bit his lip when she didntsay anything for a while she pressed her fingers to her lips and smiled so what do you think you re beautiful whispered hermione look ron she showed him the picture he grinned where did you get this he put it in the diary it usually on his desk at work answered jared he looked at ron you keep four pictures on your desk you change my picture very year but your wedding picture a family portrait that was taken in egypt and this one on there hermione handed it back to him i wish i could keep it but you said you needed to take everything back this really is it i think that everything happened here for a reason but dontworry about getting into trouble with the ministry said jared as he pulled out the time turner i was very careful about casting this spell as soon as i gone it will be like none of this ever happened see you soon what asked ron utterly confused it was too late for jared to answer any more questions as he adjusted the time turner everything began to swirl and change around them and things were slipping backwards and forwards all at once there were bright lights and then everything was still hermione was walking along king cross station with her trunk in hand she looked around for anyone she knew when she immediately saw the back of ron hair and ran dragging her trunk to catch up with him she was worried because she hadntheard from harry the whole summer ron she called out he turned to look at her and gave her a big smile she didntknow why his smile made her heart beat faster she ran until she caught up with him when she got to him she noticed that he was already wearing his prefect pin but it was flip upside down ginny was standing next to him hermione it great to see you again she told her it hasntbeen that long ginny pointed out hermione not that long at all hello ron hello hermione hermione started talking about harry i wonder if harry all right she gave a worried look to ron and ginny he hasntwritten all summer she stared at ron for a moment he noticed that she was staring at something so he followed her gaze and saw that his pin was flipped he tried to adjust it but it wouldnt stay so he had to take it and put it in his pocket ginny told hermione professor dumbledore said that he was fine i mean that he was staying at his aunt house harry blaming himself for what happened to sirius ron and hermione didntsay anything for a while as they stared at each other something about this was very familiar to them as if they had done it before a wave of d j vu came over them both at the same time ginny looked at both of them what wrong with you two nothing said ron immediately just it feels like we ve done this before finished hermione for him ginny shook her head you two are just imagining things we all just got here let go find harry she went off ahead of them ron and hermione looked at each other for a moment before they started towards the train ron brothers had taken his trunk and pig in his cage to the train for him while he and ginny went looking for hermione she still had one hand on her trunk and dragged it behind her as they continued walking onward neither of them realized that by the time they had gotten to the train they were holding hands a sure indication of things to come they reluctantly let go of each other hand as they got on the hogwarts express an i wanted to end the story in such a way that the next two books wont affect my story so much this ends temporal flux but i have another story already completed from here i always meant for jared to go back into future in such a way that it wouldntaffect the past anyway thank you for all the reviews and kind words the next story is actually linked up to this one and it about percy fate while temporal flux is happening it is a darker piece and was written concurrently with this one it will premiere soon for right now take a look at the preview tap tap tap the sound of incessant noise filled his ears clamping his hands against his ears he started to bang his head against one of the walls luck for him it was soft and insulated with rubber his bare foot kicked against it as he tried to make the noise stop it almost sounded like drops of water falling in a metal sink in his more lucid moments he could process what was happening to him it was the only time when he didntfeel like he was crawling out of his skin and the noise was at a bearable level the lights would dim and he was able to see better even if it was still a bit blurry it was his own personal hell not knowing where he was and why he was there sadly it was of his making it was them they were saying that he was crazy he spoke of things that they claimed was impossible he told them about how a world no a society separate from theirs a world where magic existed outside of fairy tales but in many ways wasnttoo different from theirs men were wizards and women were witches pictures moved rather than capture a singular moment in time electricity was unusable leaving all the modern marvels of their world lost to that society it was the makings of a fantasy novel make it stop he muttered to himself make it stop his voice was hoarse if he wasnttalking in whispers he was yelling at the top of his lungs it was then that he heard the sound of footsteps they were deliberate without pausing it came in fours first for the toes then the heels repeated again for the other foot a woman was coming he could tell from the sound he stopped muttering to himself when he heard the sound of the little window on his door slid open what do you want he demanded in a loud voice what do you want from me for more look for deconstruction to start soon kirikarin livejournal com take out the spaces disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter three meeting with dobby hermione kept stalking down the hall almost everyone moved out of her way harry and ron chased after her trying to calm her down they had never seen her lose her temper at someone like that before hermione calm down pleaded harry you said so yourself before schooling isnteverything added ron and this whole thing has taken you to a dark and scary place hermione he didntreally do anything wrong you cantbe mad at him just because he answering questions too it not like he knows any better hermione she ignored them as she shouted the password at the fat lady pixie dust the fat lady looked like she was going to scold hermione for being rude but taking one look at hermione face stopped her hermione stomped through the portal with harry and ron practically in tow what are you going to do asked ron looking at her face i dontlike that look on your face what are you thinking of doing i going to study answered hermione having regained some of her composure with everything that been going on i ve gotten soft after getting the o w l results i took a little break and that was a mistake uh huh muttered ron with a nod as he looked over her to harry so you think that jared spent the summer studying that how he able to keep up with you of course he studied over the summer ron exclaimed hermione with a wave of her arms realizing she was losing it again she closed her eyes to calm herself i mean it obvious that the americans arentas laid back as i thought they were so that means that i should get back to work and take things more seriously you werenttaking things seriously before asked harry amazingly hermione whirled around to glare at him and stalked off to her favorite corner of the common room to study before dinner to her agitation someone with wavy short brown hair was already sitting there jared she said loudly he was too engrossed in what he was doing to acknowledge her harry and ron strode over to her hurriedly when they got there jared had turned his head he looked startled yes hermione asked jared dontact like you dontknow what you re doing she sputtered ah crookshanks what are you doing with him keeping my lap warm answered jared wondering what was wrong with her he was looking at her with very innocent eyes his eyelashes were kind of long and curled perfectly when he was a child almost everyone said he was like a doll did i do something hermione was seething as she tried to calm herself she licked her lips and said you re sitting in my spot and you have my cat in your lap this is your spot yes i didntknow that no one told me that it was well i telling you that you re in my spot really really really yes harry decided to stop them jared keep studying hermione why dontwe go for a walk he said in a soothing tone you re having a bad day yes agreed ron hurriedly let go and take a walk we ll come back later and jared will be done wontyou sure answered jared actually i almost done with my homework but i dontremember how many inches of parchment that professor mcgonagall wanted for her essay i up to roll that due next week and you re almost done asked hermione as she breathed deeply she was looking at it i was going to start it tonight actually it just a rough draft corrected jared i have to edit it before i turn it in i like it to be perfect dontwe all muttered ron hermione let go but he started hermione he not doing anything interrupted harry let go the boys were on either side again and guided hermione out of the common room the rest of the common room had heard the exchange and were intrigued by jared even more ginny and neville started talking what happened to hermione asked ginny as she shot a look at jared he what happened replied neville he told her everything that happened in all the classes he had with hermione and jared by the end ginny was laughing hysterically dean seamus lavender and parvati eventually joined them and added to the recall of the day events it was the funniest thing i ve ever seen laughed seamus no one has ever raised their hand faster than hermione i loved it in dada class when he started asking those really weird questions added dean with a chuckle and when the professor said that a very good question jared hermione looked like she wanted to hex him i cantwait to see what happens tomorrow look you know that i like hermione but sometimes i just think that she needs to be taken down a few notches said lavender i mean just now look at what she did to jared he so cute and he smart too said parvati as she looked towards jared direction you mean he a little scary said neville i dontknow who going to last here him or hermione i thought that they d get along because they seemed fine on the train i thought if anyone was going to have trouble with jared it was going to be ron or harry ginny bit her lip as she thought hard about something what wrong asked neville her lips were in a firm line and she opened her mouth she shut it again as if she was putting her thoughts in order before saying okay i was just thinking that there something weird about him yeah he smarter than hermione maybe not he just as smart as her said dean thoughtfully you know you re right he fits right into gryffindor and he hasnt even been here for a week you know come to think of it there is something familiar about him agreed lavender musingly that it that what i ve been thinking exclaimed ginny she lowered her voice again i mean other than the fact that he answers questions and does his schoolwork obsessively there other things about him you know he hasntreally asked for any directions it like he knows the school layout you re right whispered parvati when he came into the great hall he just sat down at our table without thinking about it i think we re overthinking this argued neville we re not being very welcoming a shadow cast over them causing them to turn their heads jared was standing just behind them what are you guys talking about he asked as crookshanks trotted beside him he leaned against the chair that neville was sitting at it had one of the higher sturdier backs rather than the soft cushioned ones he had his hands folded over the other and his chin resting on top of them ginny asked a question that caught him by surprised how tall are you what i i an inch or two over six feet and still growing i had a growth spurt recently actually i have a lot of those answered jared as he blinked at her my brother was the tallest one here until you came you re the about the same height observed ginny she narrowed her eyes at him but he stared straight at her in fact if i didntknow any better you re built about the same you could fit into ron clothes and he could fit into yours everyone else gave a nervous laugh as jared turned and walked away ginny what did you just do asked neville nothing i didntdo anything answered ginny and it impossible isntit what impossible he asked catching a look in her eye she shook her head it nothing hermione calmed down while she ron and harry walked along the lake after thinking about it for a bit she realized how silly she had been acting she started to laugh out loud the two boys shook their heads and smiled i was being so ridiculous why didntyou two stop me she asked it was too entertaining answered harry with a laugh hermione it just a little competition and it healthy for you added ron it helps the rest of us know you re human too what about jared do you think he human ron asked hermione playfully i not so sure about that he answered with a shrug all i know is that he really giving you a challenge said harry thoughtfully i ve never seen anyone so determine to get to you without trying so hard not even ron can do that what does all of this have to do with me asked ron with mock hurt i didntdo anything hermione sighed as she rubbed her temples and laughed at herself again i guess i was just upset that i wasnt expecting it it like i got blindsided by him maybe i should apologize to him for the whole thing in the common room you never apologize to me exclaimed ron that because you re partial at fault retorted hermione harry was partly glad that things were getting back to normal at least they didntkeep asking about his summer because it wasntthat exciting harry had spent most of his summer studying the books that sirius and remus gave him for christmas the most interesting thing happened the first week he was back at the dursleys after his uncle and cousin left the house his aunt asked him about what was happening and what dumbledore was doing this shocked harry but for the second time in his life he had seen her very anxious harry was still angry with dumbledore and mourning sirius death he found some comfort in his aunt anxiety because she knew what it meant for voldemort to be back there was something about voldemort that she wasntspeaking about and like other wizards and witches she didntdare speak his name harry told her that he had seen voldemort at the ministry of magic which made her pale for several minutes his aunt didntask if he was all right but he had expected that she merely nodded and went about her obsessive compulsive cleaning causing harry to think that something had happened to her that made her clean like that he didntask and she didntoffer any explanation after that conversation they went back to normal for the rest of the summer harry uncle kept reminding him to send owls regularly to the members of the order but that was to keep them from coming to the house at all harry cousin steered clear of him all together harry was reading his books taking notes and preparing for the school year he was looking forward to regular da meetings and had devised several forms of attacks and defenses all the books contained historical facts about the dark arts giving harry a slight advantage over everyone in the dada classes however professor de luca was better than any known historical textbook on the dark arts actually i wanted to tell you about what we ll be doing in da this year started harry hermione and ron stopped in their tracks you ve already planned what we re going to do asked ron yes answered harry after what happened in the department of mysteries i decided we should focus more on offensive spells this time around hermione ventured after some minutes passed harry about what happened in the ministry you haventreally talked about she stopped because ron threw her a look to silence her she turned her head away and gazed at the lake let get back suggested ron they went back to the common room discussing their o w l results even though harry knew what his friends got it was not a surprise that he did well in dada but it was a shock that he had gotten one for potions it solved another mystery for hermione i was wondering why we re all in the n e w t level class together i want to be an auror so i dontreally have much of a choice i ll have to stomach snape for this year and the next said ron what about you harry are you still interested in being an auror i dontknow admitted harry i dontreally want to plan for the future yet maybe for the immediate but not for the distant distant asked hermione that only two years from now harry let see if i get out of here alive first then i ll worry about things like a career he said as they stopped in front of the fat lady pixie dust that nicer said the fat lady as she opened up for them the corner that jared previously occupied was empty neville was finishing up his herbology homework devoting himself much more than before because of the high score he had received in the subject ginny who was going to be taking the o w l s later in the year was busy talking to her friends they were planning on setting up a study session she was the most industrious weasley since percy hermione eyes swept throughout the room what asked harry as he took a seat where d jared go asked hermione he went to the room after he was done writing his essay answered neville crookshanks followed him i thought that kneazles were supposed to be loyal to their owners hermione teased ron i think he likes jared better than you hermione turned on her heel and started to march up the boys staircase hermione where are you going asked ron to get my cat she replied calm as she opened the door to the sixth year boys dorm honestly harry i dontthink it very fair that the girls can go up our stairs and we cantgo up theirs commented ron as he glanced at harry now ron why would you want to go to the girls dorms anyway who up there that you want to see asked harry causing ron to turn bright red ginny started to giggle at him obviously not too distracted by her friends shut up ron ordered her before i give you detention hermione walked around the dorm and spotted jared sleeping on his bed with crookshanks on the floor napping as well she was going to tell jared to stop playing with her cat but seeing him sleeping made her think otherwise there was definitely something familiar and innocent about him at the same time he was wearing only shirt and pants having removed his outer robes tie shoes and socks he had gone to sleep without pulling a blanket over himself before hermione was too angry with him to noticed just how handsome he was she was too annoyed with him to notice his eyelashes which were sort of like hers long and curled he looked awkward from time to time like someone who was adjusting to a growing body his hands were on top of his transfiguration book carefully hermione pulled it from him and grabbed the bookmark off the nightstand and saved his place she placed it next to his wand she could feel the warmth from him his hair was wavy but looked very soft touchable she didnttouch him anywhere else but his hands his hands were big but finely shaped with long tapered fingers he was right handed judging by the smudges of ink and thick writer callous she hadntnoticed that either sighing she saw how he haphazardly placed the things he had removed on top of the trunk she picked up the cloak and folded it placing the tie on top of it she straight the shoes and left the socks beside them not knowing why she was doing any of it when she was done she picked up crookshanks and left the room she closed the door quietly behind her realizing what she had done she didntwant to go back to the common room and explain herself instead she went to her dorm crookshanks woke up from his brief nap yawned and looked up at hermione she sat down on her bed with him on her lap you know something about him dontyou she whispered i wonder what you know about him crookshanks merely purred at her it was just after eight when jared woke up he noticed that the sun had gone down and sat up with a start heaving heavy breaths he looked around and noticed that he was by himself the first thing he did was put his socks and shoes back on he detested wearing socks and shoes as a child and even now he preferred to go barefoot it exasperated his mother to no end coming in with dirty feet he saw that his things were arranged but didntthink much of it he didntthink much of crookshanks being gone either he came down the stairs to the common room he wasnttoo concerned because he knew the way to the kitchens he noticed that people were still playing games but saw hermione studying harry and ron were playing chess like most everyone they were distracted at the moment jared decided to make his escape and slip away unnoticed he knew the shortcut to the kitchens and knew what routes to avoid he got to the picture of the fruit bowl and tickled the pear the painting opened and he stepped inside the house elves were busy working in their little tea towels that were marked with the crest of the school it was the first time that jared had ever seen so many house elves in one place one of the house elves wasntdressed like the others he was dressed in mismatched socks a little maroon sweater and shorts he bounded over to jared oh what the matter he asked staring at jared with his large ping pong like eyes young man hungry yes my name is jared what your name asked jared sir my name is dobby answered the house elf let me go and get you something to eat sit sit the other house elves came up to a little table and gave him a bottle of butterbeer when dobby came back they ran off he carried a huge platter of sandwiches and fruits thank you said jared remembering his manners you re welcome mister jared said dobby as he bowed and tried to leave wait do you mind joining me it been a while since i ve eaten alone i not used to it requested jared you want dobby to join you squeaked the house elf in amazement as he made a stool appear with a pop he took a seat next to jared jared offered him a sandwich which the house elf blinked at and accepted after jared gestured with it these are good said jared after they were eating for a few minutes he took a sip of the butterbeer dobby only eats with harry potter until now explained the house elf mister jared good too i in gryffindor too offered jared do you see ron or hermione wheezy dobby likes wheezy he a great one very kind to dobby hermy is good too but the other house elves dontlike her as much she keeps trying to free them but they dont want to be free dobby told jared the latter part in a lower voice jared had to get closer to hear him she and wheezy like each other i know that whispered jared with a grin i positive of it thank you for dinner and the company dobby i ll see you again later i have to go back before anyone notices that i gone dobby rose to his feet and walked him to the painting he also stuffed some pumpkin pasties into jared empty hands take these with you urged dobby refusing to let him leave empty handed jared nodded and accepted them he walked off towards gryffindor tower and took the same route as before when he got into the common room almost everyone had gone to sleep jared quietly went up the stairs to his dorm someone was sitting at the fireplace and watched him go up the stairs and shut the door quietly she rose to her feet and walked up the stairs but instead of going to her room she went to the sixth year girls dorm instead she raised her hand to knock on the door but lowered it in doubt it took everything ginny had in her to go back to her dorm and sleep away her theories about jared an it been a while since i ve done a full on ron hermione fic i pulled away for a bit because i didnthave any ideas after living memory but recently i decided to come back it is some of the easiest writing i ve done in a while i also went for lesser explored characters to avoid plagiarism but that didnt really work this is not an invitation for anyone to copy and paste my work it hasnthappened again why am i bring this up if it hasnthappened yet consider this a pre emptive strike jared hasntpulled any pranks thus far his mother didntlike him being baby sat by his uncles too much but that doesntmean that jared isntcarrying a bag of tricks his father has also been awry of the possibility of raising a prankster not that he didntfind it funny if anything jared got a couple of things from his godfather that will aide him by the way if anyone wants to keep up with this story i have author alert also in the journal i ll be posting some previews possible i havent decided yet there are several chapters ahead of this one completed but i posting slowly i d like to have some reviews before posting the next one com disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter four dumbledore army the following morning jared got up before the boys in his dorm and came down to the common room he had his transfiguration essay to edit and he wanted to do that before hermione found him in the chair again it was his favorite place to study too as soon as he was finished he went back and got ready for the day everyone else was already awake you slept a long time commented seamus um yeah jetlag explained jared lamely it common when you travel like a muggle are you a muggle born asked dean harry ron and neville looked busy but it was fairly obvious that they were listening to what they were saying jared shrugged his shoulders i dontsee how it important the tension rose from him causing the others to seize up a bit he pressed his lips together and then parted them he sighed my mother is muggle born while my father comes from one of the oldest pureblood lines in the world so what do you think that makes me it not a problem my parents were the same way too said harry no one going to bother you about that here yeah right said jared as he picked up his toiletry kit and towel he added as he went to the bathroom but then again i not harry potter the rest of the boys went about getting ready for the day quietly ron broke the uncomfortable silence harry do people ever ask about your parents like that he asked softly not really replied harry easily without as much as a blink they dontthink about where my mother came from only what she did ron shook his head and finished tying his tie he didntknow why he was thinking so hard about jared reaction towards dean seemingly harmless question it was something that ron had never been asked because as a weasley almost everyone knew where he came from harry didnthave such a problem because he had bigger things to deal with ron barely knew anything about the world that harry and hermione talked about from time to time ron felt left out at those moments seamus and dean went to the great hall ahead of them while the others waited for jared he came out with his hair damped tying his tie ron said come on we need to get breakfast jared looked little taken back by his invitation but nodded and went along with them he let neville harry and ron go down the stairs first he followed closely behind them and saw that ginny and hermione were waiting for them let go and get something to eat i starving said ginny spotting jared she went on you didntget anything to eat last night jared you must be really starved jared had stowed the pumpkin pasties in his stash of candy that he got when he was in diagon alley but i well rested he countered with a slight smirk on his face there was something distinctly familiar with that smirk as he walked ahead i woke up early to finish editing my essay ron and harry turned their heads to look at hermione waiting for her reaction she was very still as she kept her composure so what did you end up writing about she asked brightly i finished it last night i even did the essay for arithmancy what about you oh i finished that yesterday afternoon before doing the transfiguration essay revealed jared stunning hermione as he continued to walk ahead of them she was frozen in place for a moment as harry urged her forward come on hermione he whispered she walked forward but harry and ron went passed her they were hungry ginny do you know anything about him you were talking to him on the train you had more time than i did said hermione staring at the backs of harry ron and neville as they pulled away not much else admitted ginny he really a puzzle isnt he she didntknow why she didnttell hermione about seeing jared coming into the common room with food in his hands she was going to confront him herself and ask him how he knew his way to the kitchens without a guide no one knew him well enough to tell him where they were do you think he might be interested in harry ginny and hermione voices were low and the boys were long gone you think he here for harry whispered hermione she shook her head feeling a vein throbbing as rubbed her temples something in her was screaming at her telling her that there nothing wrong with jared a wave of protectiveness came over her something kicked in but she couldntidentify it he not here to do anything to harry she concluded firmly i thought you d say that said ginny by the way did you ever get crookshanks back from him hermione cheeks turned rosy she turned her head and strolled faster through the hall hermione wait what happened called ginny after her they all caught up with jared for breakfast the house elves always served every kind of breakfast food imaginable as long as it was of wizarding fare he already part way through his breakfast as harry and ron joined him hermione and ginny came a few minutes later actually ginny was trailing after hermione professor de luca says that da will have its first meeting tonight announced harry da asked jared what that dumbledore army it the defense against the dark arts club answered hermione oh that what professor de luca was talking about yesterday my attention span varies from time to time said jared causing hermione eyes to widen he ignored it so what about it everyone who wants to join will come which means that three out of the four houses are coming harry in charge so the slytherin arent going to come if they could start a dark arts club they probably would if they haventalready but a lot of their relatives were exposed last year ron informed him are you coming i dontknow answered jared there a lot of homework that i have to get through you did a bunch of the assignments already haventyou pointed out ginny that was just the essays i have to study answered jared neville shook his head you re worse than hermione he muttered what that supposed to mean demanded hermione without looking at jared who wore small stunned look on his face i not like her am i asked jared with shock hermione glared at him not that it a bad thing i sure i ll shut up now he turned his head to avert her gaze ron started laughing at them which got hermione glare redirected at him what so funny she asked calmly you guys i happy i not the only one who you re fighting with answered ron as he continued laughing hermione was going to say something until someone from the ravenclaw table walked up to them are you talking about da asked a girl she wasntluna or cho she was another ravenclaw all together she had honey blonde hair and blue green eyes in fact she was very sweet looking i saw the noticed that luna posted in our common room i was wondering if you had to say if you were going to come or not harry answered no it open to anyone who wants to come it will be in classroom that we use for dada class it was decided that the room of requirements was too good of a secret to completely expose to the school and professor de luca preferred the classroom because it as easier to find just come after dinner thanks said the girl as she smiled and went back to the ravenclaw table jared noticed that she was looking at ron before returning to her seat no one else noticed he remembered that he was there for a specific purpose and he had to remind himself that things had to play out he couldntjust stop them even if he could protect hermione feelings in the process you were saying hermione asked ron she just shook her head and dug into her breakfast jared had lost his appetite because he remembered that he had to find out where the dark wizard was before he or she could strike jared still didnthave a clue as to who was going to get hit he was sitting next to hermione feeling the warmth of her body her smell was familiar jared could recognize it anywhere because from his very first days that were the only way he knew she was near in the middle of day during lunch jared went off by himself to go back to the dorm and look through his trunk for the clues that he had he dug to the false bottom and pulled out the boards the marauders map was the first thing he pulled out setting that aside for later jared pulled out a book it was hermione diary but the main difference that this one had with the one in her room was that it was complete it chronicled the seven years that she had spent at hogwarts no one else knew about it but him and her jared flipped through it it had been enchanted to carry as much pages as hermione required he didnthave to flip very long because it had been bookmarked to the current date with an old photograph the photograph was taken at the doorway of a house that had an unusual door knocker hermione was years older beaming at a newborn infant in her arms it was a wizarding picture so the baby and she were moving she was waving his little fist towards the camera and the picture taker the baby was wrapped in a cashmere blanket a combined effort from his grandmothers one grandmother bought the expensive material but she didntknow how to knit the other grandmother could knit better than a spider the picture was colored showing that the baby had a thatch of brown hair jared stared at it for a moment and placed it face down on top of the map to his relief nothing hadntreally changed in it the spell that was weaved over jared was in place when he would leave everything would go on as if he was never there he read the entry which talked about how the first da meeting turned out there was nothing for that day that hermione logged as unusual so jared closed it and placed it back inside with the picture as the bookmark jared knew that he should read ahead more but he had to get back and he felt like he was invading hermione privacy he didnt put the map back but instead tucked it into his pocket he threw everything back into the trunk and slammed it shut jared grabbed his things and went to the next class the rest of the day didnt ease him at all as he managed to stay out of trouble the meeting was going to start another thing all together as jared thought about that girl who came to the table his parents never really talked about past suitors he did know about viktor krum who he met when he was younger his father didntseem too happy about it but was absolutely smug when viktor said that jared looked like both his parents but this girl spelled trouble jared knew that his mother wouldntbring up any of his father old girlfriends his parents were too much in love with each other he was an only child and partly the reason was because his father loved his mother too much to risk her life on having another baby during dinner jared had decided to go to the da meeting he really didnt want to go because he already knew everything harry was going to say and that wasntin hermione diary he already experienced it before in his time by the end of dinner he agreed to go to the meeting he came with the others and noticed that the other two houses had joined them as predicted the girls from the other houses remembered him from the first night they were whispering among themselves as jared tired to keep an eye on everyone from gryffindor jared called lavender i was wondering if you were coming or not it pretty crowded isntit he observed this was a time when everyone wanted to learn how to defend themselves it was when fudge was still in power in the ministry of magic but was losing support fast jared knew the rest of the story and that was probably the only reason why he wasntvery anxious what kind of defensive magic have you learned inquired ginny the institute is cutting edge with their techniques hogwarts is more traditional the institute actually has research by the faculty at almost university level so i ve picked up a few things from my dada teacher back where i come from answered jared i bet you haventchanged teachers as often as we have said neville jared shook his head nope my dada teacher started the year i started he been there ever since he used to be in magical law enforcement but decided to go into teaching instead he stopped talking and saw that harry was at the front of the dada classroom they had moved all the desks to the sides of the room to clear the middle professor de luca was leaning against one of the desk looking very inconspicuous in fact most of the students didntnotice he was there the girls had lost interest him after the first day of classes welcome back everyone said harry in a soft voice i see there are lots of new people here too so i dont think we ll be wasting any time time is something we may not have so pair off everyone we ll just go over what we did last year start practicing with disarming wands at the end we ll talk about what we ll be doing this year he went on to explain the disarming spell using ron help with a demonstration jared watched the way that ron did the spell because he had never seen him do it before after harry was done explaining he told everyone to pair off jared looked around for a partner and found most everyone pairing off because they knew each other obviously there were an odd number of people leaving jared the odd man out feeling some embarrassment at the situation he continued looking around for a partner after almost everyone had paired off he felt a tap at his shoulder yes harry he asked i supposed to be practicing too but ron and hermione paired off without me so it looks like we ll be working together answered harry do you mind no replied jared they stepped farther apart from each other and before jared could even raise his wand in a battle stance harry shouted expelliarmus jared watched helplessly as his wand flew out his hand and here he thought he would have an advantage over harry who grinned and tossed back his wand you should pay attention better pointed out harry dontwaste time jared fought the urge to smack his own forehead because that was one of the first things his professor taught him as soon as he had his bearings he shouted expelliarmus harry wand immediately came to him that good complimented harry you seem to have it want to he was interrupted by the sounds of people not doing the spell right it was the sound of a few people crashing into desks um i should check that i ll be back harry rushed off to see what happened in the other side of the room professor de luca hadntmoved from the desk he was now watching with keen interest and a smirk was tugging at his lips jared figured that he was only there to make sure that things didntget out of control and had confidence that harry could handle it what did you do asked harry to a first year who was trembling he had knocked down three older students the first year explained without saying the incantation and flicking his wand you re overdoing it if you put too much power into the spell you re going to knock the person out in fact if more than one person aims the spell at a person you will knock them out all of you should be targeting the spell at your partner not anyone else s ron and hermoine glanced at each other with small grins as they remembered something that they had done before harry knew what he was talking about from experience jared didntknow that what they had done would eventually make him one of snape least favorite students by association they moved onto another set of spells to work on and jared did them without any trouble giving harry a chance to walk around and see how everyone else was doing these spells were very easy for jared because he had a better foundation in defensive magic and credit was due to his teacher jared seemed to have a natural aptitude for everything he was doing all right i dontknow when our next meeting is going to be because quidditch is opening up for the season the quidditch teams need to train so we ll have to coordinate something hermione will be the one to set up the next meeting so keep an eye on your coins for it that was the very last announcement that harry made at the end of the meeting by this time the girl who had come to the gryffindor table earlier in the morning was making her way towards ron hermione was distracted by the quidditch captain from the hufflepuff team while someone from the ravenclaw team was also giving her the schedule cho chang was the team captain for ravenclaw but she no longer attended the da meetings there were fewer ravenclaws present than last year the hufflepuff were the same in number while the gryffindors had increased by a couple of students hello ron said the girl shyly ron turned and faced her do i know i you no you don t my name is cassandra levy she replied casey for short i watched you all of last year when you were the keeper for the gryffindor quidditch team are you going to be on the team again this year ron looked a little confused but at the same time he cheeks were red um yeah i think so harry back too this year he going to be team captain really asked casey i thought that he wouldntbe playing this year considering that he spent most of last year not playing i mean he was on your house team for what two years before your house won the cup while you did it in your first year on the team it not harry fault it was the chamber of secrets that one year and last year it was umbridge fault defended ron as he craned his neck looking for help he caught jared eye but jared didntcome to his assistance harry finished first and walked up to ron relieving him most people in hogwarts were awry of harry so casey backed off for the time being jared went off to gryffindor tower not wanting to see anymore he just had to finish what he had come for and go back to where he belonged crookshanks greeted him when he came into the common room the part kneazle rubbed up against jared slacks prompting him to pick up crookshanks jared didntsit in the chair that hermione normally sat at instead he sat in front of the fireplace crookshanks comforted jared by purring as he gently stroked his fur jared closed his eyes as he remembered what happened to crookshanks kneazles were long lived creatures and very loyal to their owners jared remembered following crookshanks around his parents house until he got too slow then they would take naps together crookshanks had been there for the first five years of jared life and had died of old age it was estimated that crookshanks was thirty years old in human years when he had died it was heartbreaking for jared at the time jared was very much like his father he was sensitive when things got to him but like his mother he couldntignore others pain some said that he looked like his father except softer and with different coloring but when people saw him with his father there was no denying it the older jared got the more he resembled his father although his father insisted that he looked like his mother staring at the fire he was so engrossed in his thoughts that he didnthear someone come in jared called ginny startling him slightly jared turned his head i see you re with crookshanks again you know hermione doesntlike you playing with him oh said jared as he set crookshanks on the floor but the part kneazle refused to leave his side the animal obviously knew who jared was or at least had a sense that he was someone familiar crookshanks continued to nuzzle against jared shins she doesntlike me very much does she ginny suddenly felt bad she was going to confront him about his trip to the kitchens the night before but couldntbring herself to do it there was something on his face that immediately made her want to make him feel better she just shocked that all she used to being the best because she feels like she got a lot to prove i mean being muggle born and all explained ginny it harder when some people tell you that your father contaminated his bloodlines by marrying your mother whispered jared he sounded both angry and sad at the same time when i first started school i had a really hard time i got into a lot of fights that first year ginny was appalled at the idea of someone telling that to anyone face to face her mouth was opened with disgust as she said fiercely you shouldntlet a few people let you think you re not good enough just because you ve got a muggle blood in you i ve heard what neville harry and the others say about you in class you re too brilliant dontlet anyone get to you like that it hard sometimes whispered jared with a sigh my mother is beautiful inside and out no one deserves to be told they re inferior either to their faces or behind their backs i cantstand it i have my father temper so when i go off sometimes i just cantstop your mother must be something if you re willing to fight for her like that said ginny softly with an appreciative smile what about your dad jared faced her and smiled lopsidedly trying to think of an answer for her after a few seconds he replied my father is the most amazing man i have ever met if i could be half the man he is then i d be something he fights for what he believes in and is loyal to his friends and family especially to my mother and me i mean he got one hell of a temper and does shoot off his mouth but he the fun parent he gets in trouble with my mother more often than i do he lets me get away with a lot more than he should but he cantbring himself to really say no to me you must miss them said ginny not really admitted jared without hesitation i dontfeel like i far from them at all ginny gave him a questioning look but before she could ask further the portal opened harry hermione and ron came in that was a lot of people said harry with a sigh as he dropped into one of the soft chairs yeah too many people agreed ron as he glanced over at ginny and jared they were sitting too close for his taste what are you two doing he demanded eyeing them suspiciously ginny rolled her eyes and got to her feet we were just talking said ginny you know having a conversation it an art you know dontquote your muggle studies class at me what were you talking about before we came in snapped ron i donthave to give you an answer i going to bed declared ginny as hurried to the stairs ron wasntgoing to drop it but he turned his attention to jared what are you doing with my sister accosted ron jared regarded him without blinking to think he was actually saying nice things about him you re a freak arentyou concluded jared normally he knew better than to push ron buttons like that but jared didntknow what came over him ron looked at him with his mouth agape in shock he snapped his jaw closed as his ears reddened jared realized he might have gone one step too far this time a freak exclaimed ron that it five points off gryffindor ron you canttake points off just because he insulted you shouted hermione why are you defending him shouted back ron hermione looked flustered because she didnt know the answer to that question she didntknow why she was defending jared and it wasntas simple as her agreeing with him or wanting to disagree with ron she felt torn as she glanced at jared briefly who rose to his feet he looked pale i i sorry just stop fighting please stop fighting he whispered in a shaky voice sounding very wounded there was something about his reaction that shocked ron and hermione into silence jared noticed it too he clutched his jaw and stalked out of the room without saying anything else he changed his clothes quickly and didnt bother to brush his teeth even if he knew he should he just didntwant to face either ron or harry when they came up he drew his curtains closed and laid there staring at the canopy until he fell asleep an jared has some issues that happened to him when he first started school even with the war over by the time he starts racism would remain an issue if jk rowling is modeling her world after ours it true so he a little defensive and perhaps overly sensitive and the plot has thicken it takes me a while to get to things because i have a need to describe things studies show that babies who lack a lot of visual acuity as newborns can smell the difference between their mother milk and another s so that should be a hint as to why jared is so familiar with hermione hmm why is hermione so determine to defend jared she done it twice here furthermore i have a few ideas as to what harry will do for a living remember the aurors are under the ministry of magic and chances are he may not want work for them after what happened in the fifth book it sort of a good hint as to what harry might end up as when he finishes school and i will assume that snape will survive to the end by the way who should find out about jared identity first i was between harry and ginny but who i leaning towards ginny but in the later chapter that i wrote harry has got as much of a chance of figuring out who jared com disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter five his mother son it was a revolting sight from where jared was sitting that casey was the most annoying person he had ever encountered at any time she was constantly talking to ron over the next few days why didnthe just shoot her down bloody hell thought jared as he continued to watch he wasntthe only one who was noticing harry and ginny were paying close attention because they were on the quidditch team they had seen casey come to all of the practices harry was elected team captain and most of the team this year was new he had the most experience and directed the team flawlessly harry did it because they needed him but he was more interested in da than he was in quidditch hermione told him that da was good but quidditch was better for harry to escape with if anyone noticed as much as jared did it was hermione to his surprise she didntappear upset or angry instead she was surprisingly calm to the point of being completely dispassionate jared disliked it even more than casey and ron together the whole made him extremely irate what the hell was wrong with these people he couldnt understand it at all he wanted know why we still need to get a better beater said ginny to ron and harry she had been helping them fill in the team because she had surprising insight to know a weasley was to know quidditch jared knew that in fact he was an excellent quidditch player but he was usually a keeper he didntsay anything because he was supposed to not know how to play quidditch at all but a weak strange american version as much as jared wanted to play quidditch he decided against it he did have a broomstick but he had it in his trunk it was much more advanced than harry firebolt so jared had to keep it hidden he needed it just in case besides jared was building a reputation for being smart not athletic people from other classes were asking him for help but he didntoffer any hermione said he was being mean but she helped them anyway jared also accidentally did something that he shouldnthave he wrote an advanced proven transfiguration theory in his paper professor mcgonagall summoned her to his office and they had a long talk about it it became a heated argument in the end she still didnt think it was possible while jared still insisted it wasntfar off the theory that jared wrote about was the ability to transfigure a wand into another object altogether so that one still could carry a wand could even be transfigured into a weapon like a sword jared had seen his father do it on more than one occasion it was extremely difficult and jared hadntbeen able to do it himself despite many hours of practice jared was no where close to being as good skilled or powerful as his parents he was still a child after all even though he was fast maturing are you sure you dontplay asked harry to jared nope answered jared i dontplay quidditch in fact i think it sounds weird ron gave him a dismissive wave of his hand you americans play that weird game what it called quodpot answered jared i mean where the explosions you guys dont have that crazy american muttered ron jared shrugged his shoulders as he spotted much to his dismay casey approaching the table he glanced at hermione who looked upset but it only lasted for a flicker jared exhaled and kept his hands wrapped under the sleeves of his cloak ron hands were right on the table he didnt want anyone to notice that he had his hands jared didntvisibly flinch when casey put her hands on ron shoulders inside he was cringing and his anger was bubbling up yes he did have his temper but at the same time he had his mother high tolerance he had to develop a thick skin when he started in hogwarts his temper flared up frequently when he first started one of his professors warned him that he couldntjust his temper control him even his father had to learn how to channel his anger properly jared was having a hard time because it was hurting hermione breakfast was over jared could even notice he went off to class trailing behind the others things were going to get a lot worse before they were over jared had to remind himself that he had to refocus if he wasntworried about harry because he knew that everything would be fine then why was he so concerned hermione and ron jared had to focus because if he wanted to figure out who need protection the gryffindor quidditch team continued to train and casey continued to see ron this continued to vex jared ginny started to notice it over time after over a week jared was no closer to figuring out who the target was and what ron saw in casey jared thought hermione was better and that casey was infinitesimal compared to her yet jared didntdo anything about it jared started attending the quidditch practice even though the first match was a week away hermione didntcome all that often because she stayed in the library he knew that she only tolerated quidditch for ron sake and eventually jared s too jared tried to chalk ron current relationship with casey as youthful stupidity but jared didntsuffer any foolishness lightly just when jared thought problems couldntget worse for him he ran into one named draco malfoy when it became obvious that jared was becoming friends with harry ron and hermione snape lost interest in him and gained irritation towards him in fact snape had given jared detention for being a know it all as far as jared was concerned it was a relief because what was happening was just unnatural he didntreally like snape being so nice to him that was the unnatural part the main problem with draco was that he didntlike jared very much at all now that was ironically funny to jared but he couldntbring himself to do anything to draco really on one particular bad day draco did say something that did set off jared temper he was on his way to see the quidditch practice hermione and neville were walking with him neville needed some help in transfiguration so hermione was going to tutor him in exchange for some help on medicinal plants in herbology draco was determined to get a rise out of either hermione or jared so off to go to see the quidditch team practice blake sneered draco i thought americans played a water down version jared had enough tolerance to ignore that snide remark no i happen to like watching quidditch bet you couldnteven get on a broomstick we have broomsticks in america malfoy in fact we ve developed some of the fastest ones in the world blake that not a common name here in england said draco coming in for a kill what are you a mudblood no answered jared coldly my father is a pureblood hermione intervened malfoy get out of our way i ll take points off if you keep blocking us she glanced at jared he looked paler but the tips of his ears were reddening with every passing second warning bells were sounding in hermione head i a prefect too granger malfoy reminded her i guess mudbloods stick together that was one step too far jared gripped his wand tightly malfoy went on i dontreally know what worse really i mean someone who is just a mudblood or a pureblood mixing with one it hard to say isntit jared released his wand but malfoy noticed and drew his come on blake what are you waiting for he taunted no magic in the halls shouted hermione as she stood between them jared let just go jared she faced him and startled at the expression of absolute fury on his face jared jaunted past with inhuman speed and went toe to toe with malfoy i dontneed a wand he said coldly as he gripped and twisted malfoy wrist causing him to drop the wand malfoy was surprised but not enough to keep from fighting back his pale face was red in pain and anger his other hand rolled into a fist and came at jared who blocked it deftly as if it were nothing in that split second jared released malfoy wrist and punched him in the stomach as malfoy went down jared used his elbow to hit malfoy back he hit his kidneys before he hit the ground neville and hermione stood there with their mouths and eyes wide open hermione took a step back when jared twisted malfoy wrist the other students in the hall stopped when they saw the fight break out malfoy cronies came running over with pansy parkinson just behind them the slytherins had their wands drawn you racist son of a bitch heaved jared i ve been dealing with people like you long enough to know that this is the only thing you understand he looked at all the wands drawn at him without any fear his jaw was clenched stop this immediately shouted professor mcgonagall as she came over what is the meaning of this what is blocking this hallway she stopped short when she saw malfoy on the ground he was bleeding from the mouth and doubled over in pain jared stood over him without turning to face the transfiguration professor mr blake she whispered come with me someone get mr malfoy to the infirmary crabbe and goyle picked up malfoy by the shoulders and lifted his feet off the ground as jared surrendered to professor mcgonagall the slytherin all parted along with everyone else pansy stayed just long enough to threaten hermione he going to get expelled from here for doing that to draco malfoy started it retorted neville get out of our way hermione was stunned into silence she glanced at the direction that jared had walked off in no one had ever actually said that about malfoy no one had ever dared to state the obvious like that hermione had seen ron lose his temper just like that but it never came down to that she decided it was best not to tell ron about what happened in the hall he would probably go and find malfoy and do something even worse than jared when practice was over the quidditch team came back to the common room to find it a buzz with news of jared and malfoy fight hermione was sitting at her usual chair ignoring it none of them had heard from jared since professor mcgonagall took him away she was nervously biting her lip not concentrating on her homework harry you re killing us declared ron as he took off his outer quidditch robes we need to get ready for the next season insisted harry the rest of the quidditch team was too tired to respond or argue they all dropped into chairs sinking into them ron noticed that the other people were talking about something and didntseem to have noticed that seven members of the house just came in what going on he whispered jared and malfoy got into a fight in the hall while you were in practice answered neville he put malfoy in the hospital broke his wrist and punched him in the stomach that what we re talking about professor mcgonagall caught the end of it and she took him to her office i think he might have even gone to see dumbledore he hasntcome back yet why did he fight with malfoy asked harry in amazement he called him and hermione neville paused i d rather not repeat what he called them jared disarmed him by twisting his wrist that how he broke it he one hell of a fighter said seamus we saw him just knock him to the floor he elbowed his back on the way down added dean ron felt his temper rise he had completely missed the details of the fight because he was only paying attention to one thing he strode over to hermione who looked up at him are you all right he asked fine answered hermione i just worried that jared might get expelled never mind him said ron with a wave of his hand i cantbelieve malfoy said that to you he rotten git he hasntgot a leg to stand on his father already in azkaban ron interrupted hermione just calm down please jared already in trouble i dontcare about him exclaimed ron still stinging from what jared said about him the night before hermione shook her head at him you both need anger management i didnt think it was possible for anyone else to have your temper but he seems to have it she said completely exasperated as she rose to her feet i going to bed ron looked flabbergasted he doesnt have my temper he shouted out loud we re nothing alike harry glanced at ginny who glanced at neville around the common room there was a general agreement that ron and jared had a lot in common not that anyone would say that in fact when ron looked around again everyone tried to look busy harry was now thinking that there was something distinctly familiar with jared the following morning was saturday jared was sleeping soundly behind his curtain he had returned to the dorms after he had his first night of detention jared was lucky that he didnthave to answer to snape instead he was given detention with de luca jared didntwant to spend time alone with either of those two professors but de luca was the lesser of the two he was sent back to the dorms after spending one grueling night cleaning the dada classroom with nothing more but a mop he had to scrap gum from under the desks and the wizarding variety was particularly difficult to remove in the end he was just dead tired professor mcgonagall didntsend jared to dumbledore despite probably wanting to there was something going on that dumbledore had to attend to jared had to serve out two weeks of detention with de luca and he wasnt allowed to go to hogsmeade with the other students twenty five points were taken off from gryffindor jared just added it to the mental count of points that he had taken off over the years from his house mcgonagall was going to send word to jared parents thinking that she could easily inform them jared got some pleasure out of the fact that his parents were easy enough to reach but mcgonagall wasntgoing to be able to get much help out of them in fact one of his parents had witness what he had done the punishment worked to jared advantage he didntreally want to go to hogsmeade anyway he knew that ron and casey were going to meet there for a date harry and hermione were probably going to go along with ginny luna and neville also jared wanted a chance to look around the boys dorm uninterrupted he had to look through two trunks his father and his godfather s he kept his eyes closed as he listened to the other boys rustle around the room his curtains were drawn indicating that he was there but not awake he could hear the sound of footsteps pacing around him if his eyes were opened he would have seen someone tugging at the curtains deciding whether to draw them open or not ron pulled his hand back from the curtains leaving them closed he was dressed in his best clothes but they werentthat great he picked the jeans that were the least worn out and the least faded shirt he had he didntknow why he was hovering around jared bed like that his eyes fell on the trunk that jared had now that struck him as strange the trunk was old older than ron s but all the clothes that jared had along with his schoolbooks been brand new it didntmake much sense to him why would someone have a really old trunk when he could afford new things it would have made a lot of sense to buy used books and get a new trunk to hold them ron glanced at his trunk and noticed that it was almost the same color as jared s only brighter it was clear that ron owned the newer trunk between the two of them he saw the top part of the jared s it didnthave the circular disk on it with ron last initial on it but there was a sign that something used to be there there were wheels attached to the bottom of the trunk but those looked newer than the rest of jared trunk before ron could examine the trunk with his fingers harry showed up from the bathroom drying his hair what are you doing he asked nothing answered ron just looking jared came back late last night or early this morning i think he needs to sleep pointed out harry as he hung his towel over his trunk dobby would come back later on and take it for laundry you wanted to ask him about last night ron stuffed his hands into his pockets no he muttered it shouldntbother you went on harry i mean he stood up for hermione and himself i not like him repeated ron from last night harry looked at him with a raised eyebrow and stopped himself from insisting that ron and jared were alike too much alike at times because there were moments when jared was completely different from ron actually harry was thinking at first that jared was a lot like hermione now he was just plain confused jared listened to all of it he had opened his eyes part way through and wanted to say something sure he was like ron but not so much so he glanced at his hands they were rough from polishing the desks he clenched them into fists then released thinking just how much he was like ron he had his hands damn it and his feet along with a lot of other things his mind went to where he had come from there was no doubt in jared mind that his parents were worrying about him his mother cast the spell but his father sent him almost unwillingly it was the only way that what his mother had said his father didntwant to risk jared at all but relented in the end it was jared idea in the first place he could still hear them discussing it with his godfather ron we have to get going said harry you dontwant to be late do you no of course not why am i wasting my time here responded ron the sound of rushing footsteps followed soon after jared laid there for a good five minutes before sitting up and drawing the curtains open the first thing he decided to do was scrub himself clean ron was the only one at the dorms who didntuse the same bathroom as the boys because he had access to the prefects bathroom thankfully the bathroom was empty because almost everyone had gone to hogsmeade giving jared some time to take a long bath smiling jared recalled how much he used to detest taking baths his father had to be the one to coax him into the tub at home every other day until he was about six years old his father ended up chasing him around the house much to his mother amusement jared soaked for a long time relieving his muscles from the strenuous work that de luca made him do like his father jared didntlike cleaning the muggle way after an half hour jared got out and dried himself off he dressed in plain muggle clothes that his mother had bought him jared walked barefoot to the room preferring not to put on his shoes and socks until the last minute besides there was no one there to compare his feet to ron s at night he was forced to wear his socks until everyone was asleep before he could pull them off as a baby his mother said he would pull off his booties with sighs of happiness no one had any idea why he didntlike socks and shoes it was an exasperating problem for his mother because his feet were dirty in the summer and cold in the winter on top of that his mother kept finding socks in the piano when he got older his father just laughed and called jared his weird child the first thing jared did was take his key out and unlocked ron trunk as he predicted it wasntas organized as his still jared carefully took things out of ron trunk disappointed he saw that there wasntmuch in there other than clothes and books jared knew about the weasley family financial status he also knew about the grangers being much more well off even by wizarding standards so when jared found the sack of money that ron had he didntbother to open it there was nothing in the trunk of any use to jared he even went so far as going through the false bottom but only found more money and some candy he carefully put everything back the way he remembered it being not that ron could tell the difference but from personal experience jared knew that ron was more observant than most people gave him credit for the next thing jared did was go through harry trunk which would have been trickier to open jared also had a key to it harry trunk was more organized than ron s jared found the invisibility cloak at the bottom and the marauders map but he already had those there wasnt much else there was a mirror that was foggy but jared didntknow why it was there jared left it alone and continued rummaging through the rest of the trunk he didntfind anything there either so he placed everything back where it belonged and shut the trunk jared glanced out the window and realized that it was still sunny enough to enjoy the weather but glanced down at the tree that was near the lake hermione was sitting there by herself why hadntshe gone to hogsmeade like she was supposed to jared hurried to put his shoes and socks on before going down to see her he was hungry but he felt like being around hermione more than getting something to eat hurriedly he practically ran out of the castle looking for her and hoping that she hadntmoved from the tree he saw that she was still sitting there without any books or homework he caught his breath trying to appear as casually as possible before approaching any closer jared cleared his throat when he noticed that hermione didntseem to see him hermione he called after a minute passed hermione turned her head slowly she hadntbeen crying but her eyes were sad oh i didnthear you she admitted as she stared at him do you want to sit with me jared didntneed to be asked twice as he sat down next to her why didntyou go to hogsmeade i didntgo because i got it as part of my punishment for fighting malfoy he told her i have two weeks of detention no hogsmeade this time and twenty five points off gryffindor he was feeling ashamed of himself at the moment fighting malfoy wasntworth it said hermione but without the usual disciplinary tone that jared would have expected i d do it again in a heartbeat admitted jared hermione whipped her head to look at him now that was the look that jared was after i mean you know look i have a really bad temper i can hold it but sometimes i just can t haventyou ever gotten so mad that you wanted to hit malfoy hermione laughed i did i did hit him once in the face actually i slapped him she said in a soft voice it was during third year but it wasntbecause he insulted me you have to pick your fights better jared jared wasntgoing to say that he fought malfoy because he had insulted her more than him malfoy had insulted hermione twice over that was really what set jared off he didntreally fight malfoy for himself that still doesntanswer my question about you being here by yourself when you could go to hogsmeade with everyone else he said changing the subject all together i just didntfeel like going answered hermione in a soft voice is it because ron and casey are having their date asked jared rather impulsively hermione closed her eyes while jared silently prayed for her not to cry he couldntstand it when she was upset but he hardly ever saw her cry look i know it isntany of my business i sorry if i prying too much he added hurriedly am i that obvious asked hermione in a whisper her lip was trembling she didntknow why she was telling jared any of it there was something in him that brought her some comfort you know the last time i really cried was my first year here ron said that i was a nightmare and that was the reason why i didnthave any friends i didntknow what was worse at the time the fact that it was true or the fact that he was the one who said it jared knew that there was only one person in the world who could hurt hermione that much was ron honestly jared never thought that ron was that oblivious for a very passionate person ron was just plain unfeeling at times maybe he didntneed to be so careful with ron trunk after all jared fought the urge to put his arms around hermione he had to keep his distance then why dontyou do something about it asked jared why dontyou just say how you feel it better than this hermione shook her head slowly i dontthink he would do anything about it we re just best friends and that better than nothing isntit i dontwant him to feel like he has to do anything else it good enough just being there i dontbelieve you screamed jared in his mind he rolled his hands into fists and swallowed the words he wanted to shout out he wanted to tell her everything was going to be fine and that he was proof of it he wanted to ease her heartache these were all the things brewing in him but he fought it he pushed it down i care too you know i care about you he whispered i love you and you love me you ve loved me even before you knew you were going to have me you love me because i also come from my father hermione swallowed but the tears remained close to the surface yet she didntcry she believed him and found solace in his familiarity an so i plagiarized from myself by taking my old idea from runaway fox and using the wand transfiguration thing it will come up later again i said that jared had his father temper so i thought it would be best to demonstrate it and i just had to find the right trigger to set him off draco always good for that purpose i think jared might be a mama boy who could really blame him if he is why throw in casey i need to bring hermione and jared together that why eventually jared will just lose control again where she concerned and ron may end up being at the receiving end of it there will be a chapter later on entitled his father son it wont be for a while though i wontbe able to update as often as i wished due to my new job with a summer camp i work with five and six year olds some seven year olds too so they will be getting my attention and energy com disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter six the tree harry wondered what had happened to hermione he was very worried because she had said that she would meet him in the common room but she never showed up later on ginny said that hermione told her to tell him that she had gone to the library to study harry wanted to know why she didnttell him herself he glanced around hogsmeade hoping that she would still show neville ginny and luna were with him ginny was very disgruntled about ron going out with casey she had her own personal opinion of who her brother should be with i cantbelieve he went out with the dumbest girl in ravenclaw she exclaimed exasperated i mean she smart but not that smart i think we ve got the two smartest people in the school in gryffindor right now agreed neville that no reason to insult cassandra said luna but she really wasnt defending her but you re right i thought that ronald liked hermione everyone stopped in their tracks most of them knew that but no one had really voiced it out loud luna looked a bit taken back making her eyes bug out even more i thought that she wasnthere because ronald went out with cassandra ginny bit her lip and glanced at harry well luna not in ravenclaw for nothing he muttered after a second or two so that why hermione didnt show up we have to do something cried ginny frantically i dontlike that ravenclaw no offense luna she turned her head at her none taken luna assured her but there nothing wrong with cassandra really it just not right though that ron going out with her hermione did seem very quiet during the whole thing pointed out neville harry what are you going to do all of them looked at harry expectantly he looked at each of pair of eyes harry shook his head look they re my best friends but i dontknow if i should get involved it really up to them isntit the hell it isntjust them exclaimed ginny angrily my brother being an idiot they re both being idiots he d better do something before someone snatches her away or something calm down ginny said neville harry right ron and hermione will have to work it out they ve never really gone out together have they i mean as a couple not as friends it not like they re going to end up getting married or anything you know not at the rate that ron is going retorted ginny she glared at harry then at neville you you boys you re just going to standby and do nothing you re all so stupid with that she stalked off luna barely glanced back at harry before she followed after ginny now what are you going to do with that kind of logic harry asked neville she acting like it our fault maybe it is harry said neville bracingly what about hermione harry didntrespond he glanced back towards the direction of the castle and he was suddenly worried about hermione he thought of going back to the castle but he also remembered that he promised to meet ron a little later swallowing harry faced neville again let go to honeydukes i ll get her something he suddenly remembered something important ron was anxious because he had no idea what he was doing he didntknow why he had even agreed to meet with casey in the first place he thought he was a bit underdressed his best clothes werentthat great but they were all that he had ron wondered why he was having such a hard time trying to come up with something to say considering that one of his best friends was a girl cassandra levy was talking animatedly about something it turned out that she was a big quidditch fan who liked the chaudley cannons if i were the coach i d start looking at the minors for better players or at least at schools all over europe you know get em while their young i think you d make a great keeper actually i thinking of becoming an auror said ron feeling his cheeks turning red it was a great compliment an auror asked casey you mean those people who fight dark wizards she looked amazed i mean it takes a lot to become one yes it does but i made it into the classes that i needed ron was getting the feeling that casey only liked him for the fact that he played quidditch he didntknow why it bothered him it just did are you on the ravenclaw quidditch team no i not answered casey i ve never even tried out everyone in ravenclaw pretty much knows who going to be on the team cho already decided that she team captain this year i guess she going up against harry potter he the team captain for your team isnthe ron nodded but he didntlike talking about quidditch he had a feeling that casey was trying to get information out of him ravenclaw was defeated by gryffindor the previous year for the cup cho was probably still crying over that while harry felt indifferent towards her ron had a feeling that cho wasntfeeling so indifferent about harry in fact ron had a feeling that cho downright disliked harry at this point ron veneered the conversation away from quidditch so what else are you interested in he didntmean for his voice to come out the way that it did it sounded deep almost husky the reaction from casey was priceless she turned beet red as she stared at him for a moment how couldntshe ron was leaning in a more relaxed position the top buttons of his shirt were open a little bit revealing that he had more than just a little muscle it came from the quidditch workouts as well as the practice against the dark arts his hands were finely shaped like a piano player s but they were coarse in the fingertips he was also tall with his blue eyes and flaming red hair being his best features can you hear me asked ron as he leaned in a bit what wrong with you dontyou do anything else but talk about quidditch he sounded rather sarcastic because he didntknow why she was staring at him he had no idea why anyone would be looking at him like that casey looked hurt as she bit her lip i i love to do fortune telling for fun not anything like that horrid divination professor i heard the rumors about her so i never bothered to take it in school i see said ron i in trelawney class and i ll tell you those arentjust rumors although i dontknow exactly who better either her or firenze they have their own way of teaching but we alternate teachers it must be fascinating to have a centaur as a teacher said casey admiringly causing ron to turn red in the ears y yeah hermione kind of wishes she had stuck in the class he mumbled casey eyes dimmed at the mention of hermione she didntlike her one bit it was now casey turn to veneer the conversation elsewhere she heard the way that cho ranted off about harry talking about hermione during their date casey didntthink much of it at the time but right now she downright detested the gryffindor girl so today your birthday asked jared of course he knew that why didntyou go to hogsmeade with everyone else i dontfeel like celebrating i never really celebrated my birthday in hogwarts ever since the first year i didntreally have any friends until halloween and ever since then it didntreally matter to me whether or not anyone celebrated my birthday or not my parents always make a big deal out of my birthday it in august revealed jared as he looked skyward you see my mother said that she really wanted to have a baby but the doctors and healers said that it would be too dangerous for her my father decided all by himself not to have any kids to keep my mother alive even though he came from a huge family i ve got a truckload of cousins so how did you end up here asked hermione watching his recognizable body language my mother sort of tricked my father into it answered jared as he turned his head with a slight smile my father didnttake it very well when he found out what she had done but he calmed down after my godfather talked to him my godfather good friends with both of them it was a given that he d be my godfather but my father said he knew he loved me when he first saw me that the only love at first sight i believe in admitted hermione so your parents love you loads dont they yes they do agreed jared i an only child my dad said that it okay he said he didntwant more children than he could stand and just between you and me there are times where i think he can barely stand me but my mother said it cause i too much like him you know what jared started hermione in a soft voice i like your name i like it a lot it funny you know i like that name it a little unusually but that one of the boys names that i like and blake is my mother maiden name funny isnt it jared didntlook startled by her revelations it took his parents three weeks to name him but that was just the way they were is there anything i could get you for your birthday he offered you donthave to get me anything you dontknow me that well countered hermione maybe i could get a toy for crookshanks he went on ignoring what she had said entirely but that would be more of a present for him than it would be for you i ve been meaning to ask you about that why are you so attached to my cat you said that you had a cat like crookshanks when i was younger confirmed jared he was the baby monitor he d go and get my parents whenever i cried he also knew when i was hungry or just wanted to be held so he knew which one to get my mother always said that if i woke up afraid only my father could calm me down the cat would walk around the bassinet when i was just born he caught a wind o wasp from getting at me once caught it with his paws hermione looked a little alarmed those pixies can do a lot of damage especially to a baby that amazing my father was prepared to vaporize it but my mother made him let it go he always listens to her even if he doesntlook like he does jared was touching the blades of grass running his fingertips over them did you really want anything for you birthday he asked again i dontknow answered hermione she glanced at his side profile thinking about how handsome he was he was almost as handsome as ron ron really wasntlike his date at all just as much as she didntlike the mention of hermione the conversation went astray they were deteriorating as the date went along ron found her boring because all she did was agree with him it wasntvery stimulating at all time crept by slower than usual it seemed he started to wonder where harry was that was the reason why he told harry to come up and see him and he thought that hermione would have been brought along come to think of it he hadnt seen her that day at all casey was prattling on about something that ron wasntpaying attention to he wasnteven giving her the courtesy of at least pretending he cared casey was feeling more than just frustrated at ron you know what she asked him somewhat aggressively what prompted ron hoping that she would shut up sooner or later you re really just a bad date all around arentyou i should have listened to padma on this one concluded casey icily if you dontlike me so much then you can just leave retorted ron feeling his temper rising his voice was already raised what the bloody hell is your problem look at me spat casey i went all out for this date and all you could do is wear what you re wearing ron mouth was open in utter insult for the first time he actually looked at what casey was wearing sure enough it was the latest thing in the wizarding world of fashion ron clothes were outdated by at least a couple of years he had holes in his jeans he was seething through his teeth sorry i didntnotice he said sarcastically knowing that would anger her more which is exactly what it did casey shouted you are the most stupid boy i ve ever meet i ll make sure that ravenclaw takes you out for the cup this time around i should have known better than to go out with a poor weasley this was a waste of time i would rather be poor than stuck up like you levy shouted ron as he got to his feet his ears were bright red i cantbelieve it you re the real waste harry and neville had just arrived when they heard the yelling neville winced at the way that casey insulted ron while harry watched stoically holding a bag from honeydukes and another package he waited until casey stormed off without crying she shoved her way passed a couple of people and straight through neville and harry without a backward glance now that the second time ron gone out with a ravenclaw isntit asked neville in a whisper harry just nodded as he stepped forward not a word harry muttered ron as he got to his feet feeling very poor and dirty he sounded gruff and his confidence level had dropped let just go back fine agreed harry knowing that he couldntreally do much the only person who would be able to reassure ron would be hermione hermione back in hogwarts ron stopped and turned to look at him why didntshe come with you i couldntfind her ginny said that she went to the library to study answered harry you know hermione she been trying to keep up with jared oh muttered ron he had almost forgotten about jared didntmake it did he he probably wasntallowed to come this time after that fight with malfoy explained neville look you should head back but i said i d meet ginny and luna too we were all suppose to meet together at the three broomsticks but if you want to go back fine you can tell ginny what happened sighed ron i d rather not repeat it he continued to walk ahead harry nodded at neville before catching up with him neither of the boys talked about what really happened but harry had a feeling about it he heard the mention of padma recalling that ron date with her didntgo well either harry kept his mouth shut about mentioning hermione he knew it wasnta good time to bring it up harry was starting to wonder what hermione was up to hermione was laughing it was a sound that jared knew all too well it was one of his favorite sounds but he liked it much better when it was with ron she was actually laughing at the fact that jared was climbing a tree to retrieve a kite he had brought it out and they had spent the last hour running with it everything was going so well until the kite got stick in the tree jared made it with tissue paper using a design that his grandfather taught him it had gotten stuck in one of the tall willow trees he had to climb up the tree which he did with ease because he had had lots of practice at first hermione was worried about him falling down and breaking something but now he was just sitting on a strong branch looking down at her you could have just used your wand to get it down shouted hermione with a grin on her face where would be the fun in that shouted back jared as he looked around from the branch looks really nice up here you should get up here i dontthink so exclaimed hermione dontthink you can get up do you teased jared playfully it not that but you re afraid of heights arentyou hermione shook her head and started laughing again you re unbelievable you know that you fly kites and climb trees is there anything you cantdo not really responded jared smugly my parents said that i could do anything i want as long as it isnt immoral or gets me arrested my father said that i may have my own body but he responsible for it until i legal and even then he a little worried about the horror he unleashing upon the world somehow i dontthink you listen to your parents very well agreed hermione as she continued to grin at his words that true my godfather once told them that they donthave any hope of controlling me they can only hope to contain me by this time ron and harry were back in their dorm they both noticed that jared curtains were drawn harry handed some of the candy from honeydukes to ron it included an assortment of sugar quills chocolate frogs and botts every flavor jelly beans which ron put into his trunk just as harry walked by one of the stands he saw from the window something that made him laugh out loud what demanded ron not really in the mood for anything jared up in a tree by the lake answered harry he looked closer when he saw the back of hermione head harry kind of stiffened because he had a very bad feeling about telling ron about that part he didntget a chance to ron was already standing beside him what kind of idiotic thing is he up to now hermione what she doing with him harry didntbother to tell ron to calm down he could only follow ron as he ran down the stairs and tore through the rest of the castle trying to get the lake and the tree harry was able to keep up they were both out of breath by the time they had gotten to the lake hermione turned her head the smile on her face was wide which was something that hardly anyone had seen in a while ron completely ignored that as he stalked up to her what are you doing with him he asked sharply as he jerked his thumb upwards at the tree nothing answered hermione immediately disliking the accusing tone that he was using we were just talking then we were flying a kite that he brought jared had to climb up the tree to get it down when we got it stuck up there get the hell down here roared ron causing jared to flinch he really hated it when ron used that tone on him now i dontthink so i think i ll stay up here for a while i dontthink it safe for me to come down said jared quietly knowing better than to comply with ron ron stop yelling snapped hermione why are you so mad why arent you in hogsmeade with casey jared felt his throat get stuck at her words his skin had gone pale when he saw the look on ron face ron jerked his head away from jared to face hermione she had her hands on her hips her battle stance ignoring her question entirely ron started yelling at again you always takes someone else side why do you do that i not on anyone else side why do you always get jealous when i spend time with someone else what do you expect me to do just be on standby until you want something from me you always come after me when i have one foot out the door why is that retorted hermione angrily stunning ron completely tears of anger were pouring from her eyes which she furiously rubbed way with her fists without anything else to say hermione walked passed ron then harry making a path back to the castle ron was stood still he was stunned by her words but more by her tears he completely forgot about jared altogether jared was absolutely torn between them he clutched the kite between his fingers tightly harry stepped forward a little bit but didntsay a word he looked upwards at jared but he didntfeel any anger towards him ron are you all right ventured harry in a soft voice oh whispered ron much more subdued i have to go and change out of these clothes i wouldntwant to ruin them he pivoted on his heel and walked off in a direction that pulled him further from the castle harry sighed as he looked at jared again who was climbing down the tree he had thrown down the kite just before his feet touch the ground harry picked up the kite for him and handed it back to him thanks whispered jared i was wondering about something said harry softly he was about to have a nearly identical conversation like the one he had with viktor krum i need to talk to you jared dusted off one of his hands on his shirt his clothes were dirty but much newer than anything ron wore it none of my business he immediately said jared didntknow which one he disliked more ron raising his voice in anger towards him or the quiet way harry had of getting to him he was ready to walk off he really was but he stopped himself what is it he muttered what going on between you and hermione asked harry you seem to be very interested in her jared paused and held his breath harry stared at him into his bottomless brown eyes he listened to jared breath for a second before he went on i dontsee why you re provoking ron like that or why your provoking hermione like that in class why are you doing it i not trying to provoke anyone un harry spat jared just barely making a mistake he closed his eyes for a moment he had to get out of there before he really did something stupid when he tried harry stepped in his path he was taller than harry currently but he knew better than to try to get passed him please get out of my way no responded harry forcefully if you re not trying to provoke anyone then what are you doing with hermione what is going on between the two of you jared wanted to say that they were just friends but that wasntthe truth he felt something tugging at his consciousness he stepped back from harry remembering something harry trained over the summer in occlumency even though he spent almost no time with his friends however harry also was trained in legilimency as part of the effort to keep his mind clear from voldemort intrusions harry connection to voldemort also gave him the near ability to read someone without reciting the incantations there was only one way that jared could get passed harry at that point so he took it i love her he whispered harry eyes widened with surprise stunning him effectively and giving jared the escape route he needed however he could not help but add as he continue towards the castle which he said loud enough without turning but how i love her you ll have to figure that out harry stood still blinking and listening around him by the time he had turned around jared was already out of sight harry shook his head trying to figure out who he should go after he stared at the tree it was the same one he had seen when he looked into the pensieve when it contained snape memories it was the same tree that his father and friends had gathered under touching the trees with his fingers harry wondered just how many lovers spats and quarrels did this tree bear witness to an i ve taken a real liking to neville since the fifth book so he getting some choice lines and i didnt want to keep him as a loner so he going to be hanging out with ginny and luna for most of the story i love irony it one of my favorite devices along with cliffhangers but i love irony the best i dontuse the word love that often either so that should be saying a lot and it looks like the mere mention of hermione name is enough to turn a date with a ravenclaw south ron pretty smart even though he doesntget much credit for it i mean he gets overshadowed by his best friends harry has a tendency to work best under pressure so that when his most brilliant ideas come about hermione is always studying so that how she pretty smart i think ron goes by instinct even more jared has inherited this ability as well as the book smarts there an oedipal complex going through this thing isntthere ron and jared seem to be fighting over hermione jared maybe able to beat hermione in academics but there are things that he simply cannot beat ron at jared is just causing conflict between ron and hermione accidentally though sorry about the delays my old computer ran into some trouble and i ve been busy working for the summer i sprained my ankle at work and i really dont want to go into the details the new computer is a dream come true but at a hefty disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission temporal flux chapter seven dumbledore office ginny and neville returned several hours later close to sundown with the other students by that time ron was brooding in the boys dorm jared was sitting in hermione designated chair while she was in the library harry was sitting by himself in front of the ron chess board pondering about what jared had said earlier he knew for sure that he wasntabout to tell ron what jared had told him ron hadntreally done anything to jared but it was only a matter of time harry was on ron side yet at the same time he didntwant anything to happen jared for right now it was better that all three were separated ron had left his chess set out so harry was just setting them up the chess pieces were getting antsy glancing up expectantly at harry to get the game going do you mind if i enjoy offered jared as he shifted to look at harry sure answered harry jared got to his feet and took the chair across from him do you know how to play yes replied jared ginny came up just then and asked what going on where ron and hermione what happened on ron date actually i kind of want to know myself said jared looking expectantly at harry i mean it might explain why he got so pissed with me just talking to hermione harry glanced at ginny then at jared it seemed like the chess pieces wanted to know too he sighed and gave a brief summary of what happened on ron date with casey ginny was livid while jared was grinning i cantbelieve how stuck up that little ooh just wait until i get my hands on her exclaimed ginny she not worth it said jared she wasnteven worth the date and why are you spending so much time with hermione demanded ginny as she glared at him why canti spend time with her countered jared cleverly ginny clutched her jaw and wore the look she often did when she attempted to discipline him it was an expression close to his grandmother s jared assumed the look that weasley boys often wore when they wanted to look innocent it was something he had picked up from his uncles not that it ever really worked it sure wasntworking right now i mean it her business who she wants to spend time with ron doesnt have the monopoly on that does he what do you have against my brother challenged ginny as she slammed her hands palms down on the table startling ron chess pieces i ve got nothing against him answered jared automatically i like him just as much as i like hermione ginny turned her head at harry for some assistance because jared was absolutely confounding her harry stared at jared if what he said about hermione was true did that mean that jared loved ron too that didntmake any sense at all or did it harry would have said more but he felt a sudden sharp burning pain in his skull he groaned as his hands automatically flew to his scar he was heaving gasping for air jared was on his feet harry are you all right he asked what wrong what going on ginny jared turned to her and saw that she had gone pale harry can you hear me asked ginny as she placed her hand on harry shoulder calm down block it block it jared go and get professor mcgonagall now she shouted the last part because jared seemed froze in place he blinked then made a dash for the portrait no don t moaned harry trying to control his breathing he was focusing on blocking this intrusion into his mind he had to fight it he didntwant dumbledore to find out he concentrated trying to keep himself calm and ease the pain that was penetrating through his head it was much stronger than it had ever been before harry would have allowed himself to see the visions but not now it was too dangerous he knew how dangerous they were it cost sirius life harry collapsed succumbing to the darkness jared knew that they were trying not to talk in front of him he considered the three of them a trio an old man a spy and a priest jared had gone to get dumbledore as ginny had ordered him too and snape and de luca joined him it was the dada professor who had given him entry into the headmaster office jared was holding his breath knowing that it didntlook too good for him snape was probably telling the other two that he was dangerous to harry jared had the unfortunate luck of being present when harry collapsed and it wasnthis doing at all ginny had gone to get ron as soon as harry was helped into the infirmary and together they had gone and fetched hermione from the library that much jared knew he cursed himself for not reading this in the diary ahead of time he should have known that harry was going to get attacked even in hogwarts voldemort had a way of getting in not that jared was afraid of the man or even the name it took a long time before anyone could say voldemort name in a sentence maybe it was better that jared didntknow it would have looked more suspicious otherwise jared was sitting across from dumbledore desk while the headmaster was conversing with de luca and snape after another five minutes of heated whispering snape stalked off with de luca following closely behind jared swallowed feeling his throat constrict as the headmaster swept up to him jared had read hogwarts a history numerous times in the revised edition that he had practically memorized dumbledore had a whole chapter devoted to him but still jared had a feeling that the chapter left out a lot of things headmaster stated jared without looking at him dumbledore took a seat at his chair would you like a lemon drop jared he offered his blue eyes sparkling i suspect that you have a sweet tooth that was true jared loved sweets he took one drop but didntput it in his mouth thank you professor dumbledore he whispered the headmaster leaned back against his chair his eyes never leaving jared face you are a very gifted student jared very gifted indeed your parents must be very impressed with you jared didntlike where this conversation was heading so he decided to take a different route he had a way of disarming people he did it very often with his parents and family there was very few people who were immune to his tactics whatever do you mean he asked innocently almost batting his eyelashes for effect blake is your maternal grandmother name isntit asked dumbledore jared remained calm his expression never wavering you do have your mother eyes much like how harry potter has his mother eyes however judging from the report from professor mcgonagall regarding your fight with draco malfoy earlier you seem to have inherited your father temper now the real question is not who you are but why you are here how did you figure it out asked jared very impressed and elated that the history books werentlying through keen observation of your activities that and professor de luca has his ways of figuring things out replied dumbledore he was right to trust you you arenthere to harm anyone but why are you here i cantsay answered jared please dontforce me to give you an answer the headmaster stared into his eyes with a soft smile on his lips i must say that i am surprised at how well ron weasley and hermione granger son will turn out you are a credit to both of them however i cannot have you running around my school causing problems between my students jared pulled at the chain around his neck it was in the shape of an hour glass but rather than holding sand it held a clear blue liquid inside this is an advance time turner it was original developed by my mother he explained it works a bit differently combined with a spell it keeps a person in a different time for as long as they wish the spell will hold as long as i dontflip it over my parents didntwant to send me back so i went on my own a disobedient weasley as if i have never heard of one before joked professor dumbledore he sighed do you have any intention of telling your parents would they believe me laughed jared i dontthink either of them like me right now especially my father he was yelling at me today dumbledore shook his head with a chuckle there is very little i can do if it is a family issue for you just do not fight with anymore people in the halls in my defense malfoy insulted my mother no more jared i am sure that you are aware that your mother can fight her own battles insisted the headmaster if you require any assistance from me please say so there is one thing i just have to know what did you tell de luca and snape what are you really doing here jared clamped his mouth shut at that question because he didntreally want to give any information it was bad enough that people were on to him he found dumbledore eyes unreadable but didntventure to ask again they had a silent agreement so jared sighed and instead asked may i leave now i have detention with professor de luca in a little while very well but remember i will be keeping an eye on you dumbledore reminded him i sure you wonthave any trouble finding your way back to gryffindor tower no agreed jared and i would have never had a problem finding this office he got to his feet and let himself out while dumbledore got to his feet he reached towards fawkes and gently stroked his feathers did you notice anything about him fawkes asked dumbledore to his familiar fawkes gave a melodious noise i dontknow what he up to either he very well trained dumbledore found it difficult to read jared because he had successfully blocked him it was most intriguing when jared got out of the office he walked towards the infirmary instead of gryffindor tower he stopped just sort of the corner when he saw ron and hermione coming out they were talking in hushed tones i forgot that it your birthday today said ron um i sorry i didntget you anything it all right said hermione we never really celebrate it anyway harry got you something but i think he wants to give it you later i wish i could have gotten you something explained ron looking rather sheepish let worry more about harry said hermione not wanting to talk anymore about her birthday what do you think happened to him asked ron i was in our room at the time ginny just went and got me jared went and got dumbledore because ginny told him to he and harry were at the chessboard hermione bit her lip jared knew it was a sign that something was troubling her and once again he had a feeling that the conversation wasntgoing in his favor she pulled a lock of her hair behind her ear what is it asked ron dontyou think there something weird about jared asked hermione with a sigh ron raised his eyebrow at him it was something that jared had unconsciously done earlier causing hermione to do a double take as she looked at ron there something strangely familiar about him dontyou think i try not to look at him really he really irritates me hermione confessed ron i had no idea that anyone could be that obnoxious hermione laughed at his words as she shook her head i know someone who just as annoying she laughed are you comparing me again to him i nothing like him exclaimed ron loudly realizing that was too loud he repeated in a softer voice i am not like him hermione shook her head there are times where he exactly like you what about in class asked ron what about with you he like you not me he more like you than he like me insisted hermione jared was having a difficult time holding in his laughter it wasntthe first time his parents had that argument but it was the first time they had ever had it without realizing it he was nearly choking on his laughter and he was about to leave hey what are you doing here demanded ron angrily his ears were red are you eavesdropping no replied jared automatically wearing his innocent look again actually i just wanted to know if harry was all right he fine madame pomfrey just wants to keep him overnight hermione informed him she placed her hand on ron wrist to keep him from doing anything she was doing it without thinking jared looked pointedly at her she gave him a puzzling look before she glanced down and noticed what she was doing ron was staring at her as she released him suddenly jared had a grin on his face as they reddened in front of him hermione cleared her throat and said why dontwe head back jared has to go with us because he might get detention if he gets caught and we have our prefect badges to keep us safe ron shoved his way passed jared what the hell are you smiling about nothing answered jared hermione wore an exasperated expression not knowing who she should throw it towards she and jared just followed closely behind him from around the corner of the corridor that jared just came out of professor de luca shook his head and smiled because someone had completely forgotten his detention jared woke up with a start the following morning he realized that it was sunday but realized that he never showed up for detention damn it he thought frantically as he climbed out of bed he nearly fell out of bed and opened his trunk he grabbed his toiletry kit and made a dash to the bathroom he dumped almost everything into his trunk and was only half dressed on his way out of the door hermione was just coming out of the girls side when she saw jared practically sliding down the side of the stairs he was trying his shirt over his head his stomach was exposed many people told him he was built like his father but hermione never saw ron without a shirt before and she wouldntuntil the next summer or so she had no idea that jared slender muscular structure was almost exactly like ron s she blushed at him as he tried to pull his shirt over his head but he ended up stuck ah he exclaimed struggling with his shirt the sleeves seemed tangled hermione shook her head as she went downstairs she held her giggling in as she asked jokingly do you need some help didnt your parents teach you how to dress yourself she assisted him and pulled the bottom edge over jared stomach he smoothed out his shirt she noticed a chain around his neck but didntthink much of it his hair was sticking up in one side hermione resisted the impulse to smooth it out even though it was very tempting instead she asked why are you in such a hurry on a sunday morning for you information i could have dressed myself yes my mother taught me how to dress myself and for your last question i forgot i had detention last night i have two weeks of it i have to go and talk to professor de luca before he gives me more detention and hopefully explain to him why i forgot jared said it in a very rushed voice but at the same time he sounded almost bossy now i have to go good luck called hermione after him impulsively thanks said jared as he left hermione sighed as she shook her head are all boys like either ron or jared she wondered if that was true then she was really worried she felt tired because she was between the both of them she sat in her chair noticing that someone had left something on it hermione picked it up and saw a short note with it the smile on her face grew as she read it sorry about almost forgetting your birthday sorry about it being late too i know that you said you really didntwant anything i wish i could have gotten you something better but this will have to do ron she unwrapped the plain paper wondering when ron got it because he had come back from hogsmeade empty handed it was a small jewelry box that was just the size of her palm she opened it and found that it was empty but it was a beautifully crafted there was an intricate design on it representing the rune symbols she was studying in her class what she didntknow was that ron had picked it up in diagon alley weeks before school began ron just didnt want to hand to her in person and with anyone around he had dropped it off on the chair after everyone else had gone to sleep in the early morning hours he had taken the chance of jared finding it first ron also didntwant anyone else to see the small jewelry box he really could only afford it suited hermione fine because she hardly ever wore jewelry except for special occasions the last time she wore piece of jewelry for a long period of time was the time turner she didntthrow the note away instead she folded it and placed it inside the jewelry box she went back upstairs to put it in her trunk harry still hadnthad a chance to give hermione the candy he had picked up for her favorite candy from honeydukes none of the other girls stirred when she put the jewelry box in her trunk next to her diary realizing that she hadntwritten yesterday entry she picked it up and grabbed her quill jared still had not had a chance to check her diary in the last few days if he had the entry would have read like this i haventreally written yet about the new boy jared blake he says he from los angeles but i not so sure about that he is the strangest person i ve ever met it like he knows me or something at first he got on my nerves but whenever i look at him i canthelp but think that there something special about him he really knows how to get to ron it funny really funny ron and jared have so much in common they have the same gestures they both make sarcastic remarks and they have the same temper it exhausting trying to keep them from hurting each other especially keeping ron from hurting jared i know that ron doesnttrust him but i do i cantexplain why though i just do i feel comfortable with jared like we have a bond together and that why he knows me so well hermione stopped because she could hear lavender or parvati waking up she closed her diary and returned it to her trunk by the time her roommates were up she was just brushing her hair hermione didntlike to take much care in her appearance normally but she was trying to appear as if she hadntrun into jared and gotten ron present it was like the two situations were connected together she was in deep thought when ginny tapped her shoulder she gasped i sorry said ginny equally startled by hermione reaction it okay ron waiting for you he wants to go and see if harry all right i ll be there ginny was giving her a smile similar to jared s what demanded hermione you were getting ready for ron werentyou teased the younger girl hermione cheeks immediately went rosy no she said defensively i was not i was just brushing my hair that all you dontreally like brushing your hair insisted ginny hermione sighed and rolled her eyes at her deciding that it was better to ignoring ginny for the time being honestly hermione was starting to think that fred and george were bad influences on her hey dontignore me shouted ginny after hermione hermione came down and saw that ron was waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs he had his hands in his pockets looking up at her expectantly what took you so long she was brushing her hair answered ginny for her hermione looked back at her with a glare causing ginny only to grin at her again hermione turned back at ron and rolled her eyes i ll see you two later added ginny arentyou coming along asked her brother nope just the two of you answered ginny with some satisfaction i also have to meet with my study group she practically skipped the last two steps of the stairs grinning like the cheshire cat hermione yanked ron arm and dragged him out of the common room this was no easy feat but she managed to get him through the portrait what was she talking about asked ron utterly clueless he looked absolutely irresistible at that moment his hair was ruffled a bit too hermione shook her head she was just babbling you know how your sister is she explained lamely without looking at him oh murmured ron noticing the way she was avoiding his eyes you know that date i had with casey how did it go not so well i just donthave any luck with girls it seems except for you that is hermione swallowed hard but she had the compulsion to say something to make ron feel better she just wished he had more confidence in himself you will someday she attempted to reassure him i dontthink so i mean look at harry he got money naturally good at quidditch money isnteverything ron interrupted hermione sharply as she faced him so what if he good at quidditch so are you stop comparing yourself to harry or anyone else your brothers arentbetter than you either i wish you d just see that for yourself ron gaped at her thinking that his ears were playing tricks on him hermione turned a little rosy again and looked away from him this was the way their conversations went they either argued over something stupid or were telling each other things that the other one wanted to hear in front of other people they argued hardly anyone ever saw them talk to each other like that you re a good friend hermione concluded ron softly without taking his eyes off her yeah a good friend echoed hermione feeling more upset and mildly hurt at his statement a friend just a friend of course that was all she really was to him that why it took him so long to notice that she was a girl let go see if harry all right said ron because they had stopped walking completely are you all right hermione his voice sounded anxious after another minute of silence did you like the present i got you i know that it wasntmuch but i love it hermione said in a whisper without looking at him as they continued in silence an a very bad explanation for jared time turner isntit it works for me as for the wrist grabbing that was definitely an allusion to the movie i think that so cute okay and this whole chapter is just filled with ron and hermione moments the end part is left open for interpretation did hermione really mean that she love the present or someone else actually jared just one big moment in their lives still haventdecided who among the students should catch jared first that not really true i had time to write the story over the break without the new computer so yes i know who finds out first disclaimer i do not own harry potter this story belongs to me and cannot be posted anywhere else without my permission
