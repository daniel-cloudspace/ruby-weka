 a new definition of family chapter 1 upward bound disclaimer well i dontown any of jk rowling characters big surprise i know any characters and spells you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are my babies harry lay on his back and tried not to move in the oppressive summer heat his movements were languid and his thoughts followed suit he had had three weeks to contemplate the amazing things that had happened in those last few days of the end of the term third year had been quite eventful but there were only so many times one could mull over the events before they became well rather mundane briefly he wondered when his friends would contact him he d not heard the littlest peep from anyone in the wizarding community the thought joined others that swirled endlessly in a slow circle like water trying to drain down a clogged pipe he tried to get worked up about it but failed miserably as his mind followed the example of his body and lolled about lazily harry might have felt less stifled in his room at 4 privet drive had the window not been nailed shut knock knock knock harry turned his head slightly to hear as his uncle opened the front door boy growled uncle vernon get down here slightly faster than a lizard in torpor harry swung out of bed and made his way downstairs standing in the hallway was a plain looking woman with brown hair in a business suit vernon had a frown on his face there appeared to be a confrontation of some sort going on this cannot be good thought harry mr dursley i can assure you that the upward bound uk program is not considered soft on troubled boys i disappointed that you dontseem to have the confidence in the program that your letter to us implied the strange woman said i was under the impression that the program was run by ex military types not mere slips of girls like you the woman plastered on a fake smile i assure you sir that i am a counselor trained in the rehabilitation of teenagers with personality disorders and that i am quite capable of handling your nephew situation when she saw that vernon was not convinced she added i am ex green beret vernon brightened a little harry finally shook off the paralyzing shock long enough to say hang on what is going on here vernon opened his mouth but the woman interrupted mr potter your uncle was fortunate enough to secure the last open spot for you in our summer program for delinquent teens be advised that this opportunity is a rare one from what your uncle has reported you are lucky indeed to be offered this last chance before you end up incarcerated in the juvenile justice system you have ten minutes to pack your things and then we are leaving harry gaped as his sluggish mind scrambled to assimilate what he d just heard he looked remarkably like a fish that had found itself in the desert wait miss vernon started levy she supplied miss levy is it possible to arrange for you to take the boy to catch his train to his boarding school when the program is over i mean miss levy paused to contemplate this which school what train station what day st brutus secure center for incurably criminal boys kings cross station 1st of september well the program ends on the 31st of august but yes yes i think i will be able to arrange it splendid dursley beamed thinking that petunia would be pleased that he had rid them of that horrid boy for the rest of the year miss levy turned to harry shouldntyou be packing harry sputtered and turned an even darker shade of red with anger his mind had by now slipped out of its muddled haze and his body decided to follow the example he turned to his uncle and shouted you cantdo this miss levy proceeded to demonstrate just how competent she was in dealing with recalcitrant teens she leapt in front of vernon and faced harry she grabbed him by the shoulders looked him straight in the eye and said mr potter do not make your situation worse please do what i say now he glared at her but his mouth almost dropped in shock again when he saw her barely wink at him she gave a slight jerk of her head indicating the stairs and quirked her left eyebrow harry mind raced and his heart pounded what was going on she wiggled her eyebrows up and down and the corners of her mouth turned up ever so slightly before she turned around to vernon took his arm turned him toward the kitchen and said mr dursley there is a bit of paperwork harry turned and started up the stairs when he saw his cousin on the upstairs landing smirking for all he was worth didntsee that coming did you freak dudley chortled harry had the presence of mind to glare at dudley and stomp a bit as he went to his little room and slammed the door hedwig looked up startled and indignant and almost ruffled her feathers in protest but the languor that had held the room in its spell was still in effect she merely glared she was not happy about being imprisoned in her cage the last three weeks harry understood how she felt he stood for a moment in the stifling heat brow creased in thought until his eyes fell upon an envelope on his bed that had not been there before it was addressed to harry potter the smallest bedroom 4 privet drive little whinging surrey he turned it over and was surprised to find elegant handwriting mr potter neither my owl nor i was able to get to you or you would ve had warning i had to wait until i was in the house before i could deliver this to you sorry it was signed miss levy and harry did not miss the quotation marks around her name he tore open the envelope dear harry i sure you wontobject to a little scheme to get you away from the dursleys a bit early this summer on 23 july one of my associates will be arriving at your home posing as a director for a camp for juvenile delinquents i am counting on you to play along and make it look believable sincerely albus dumbledore harry immediately opened his trunk and began packing his belongings his eyes widened in surprise as each item he put in shrunk down to a tenth of its size how was she able to do that she had not been up to his bedroom he had not seen her with a wand a niggling thought finally broke through to the surface what if she was an imposter sure his window had been nailed shut but a detail so minor had never stopped dumbledore from getting a letter to him before his letter did not specify if his associate was a man or a woman this woman could have intercepted dumbledore letter and used it to her own advantage why else would she have to wait till she was in the house to deliver it harry mind worked furiously he grabbed a scrap of parchment and scribbled a quick note to the weasleys he would play along and if he found himself in the clutches of one of voldemort followers he would just have to make sure he could let hedwig loose with the letter uncle vernon aunt petunia and miss levy turned at the sound of harry trunk ka thunk ka thunk ka thunking down the steps the trunk was actually pretty light thanks to the spell on all the contents but harry could not help taking out his anger on the dursleys in a childish but satisfying way for all they knew they were sending him to some sadistic tough love type program for criminals and by the looks on their faces they were glad miss levy gave a little gasp at the sight of hedwig in her cage uhm a pet owl that a bit unusual i afraid the pet will have to stay here no shouted harry vernon and petunia in unison miss levy huffed out an impatient sigh and said alright i ll see what i can do she pulled a cell phone out of her briefcase flipped it open and began dialing as she strode out the front door to the stoop reception she stated over her shoulder as the door closed three people stood frozen as they listened to her muffled conversation she swung the door open and entered they will agree to board the bird on the condition that we can use it in our animal therapy program for the more mentally disturbed boys it seemed to harry that her eyes sparkled just a bit with amusement as she looked at him done snapped petunia eager to get her nephew his owl and his trunk out of her home what harry cried playing his part they cantsubject hedwig to insane boys boy growled vernon in warning harry shut his mouth he wanted to get himself his owl and his trunk out of this home just as badly well then miss levy said brightly you have all the contact numbers with the paperwork we will make sure the boy gets to his train he is packed and it looks like everything is in order we ll just be on our way then she paused to let the family say their good byes no one said a word suddenly dudley came stomping down the stairs and sneered hope you have a grueling summer freak miss levy appeared a bit taken aback but recovered her composure and announced firmly he will have a character building summer i assure you mr dursley you will be quite satisfied with our program i will be quite satisfied if you would just get this miscreant out of my house yes uh well then uh come along mr potter she turned and walked purposely out the door with harry in tow as harry stowed the trunk in the boot of a rather old and worn car the dursleys lined up happily on the front stoop harry got himself and hedwig in the back seat and he turned to glare at his family as miss levy drove off petunia hugged vernon while dudley pumped his arm up and down several times in the air harry slumped down in the seat disgruntled and dejected well they really are a sodding lot arentthey miss levy stated her voice tight with anger harry grunted give me a minute or two to get us out of the neighborhood and we ll get this sorted out right she asked as she glanced at harry in the rearview mirror yeah he quietly replied she swung into the car park of a shopping center and circled around the back stopping the car when it was out of sight of the public finite incantatum she turned to harry as the glamourie spell wore off to reveal a woman with short dark red hair and large green eyes the color of her hair and eyes reminded him of his mother so forcibly that he felt a sharp stab to his heart my name is arinna dunlevy and we have just successfully completed the kidnapping portion of this adventure her words did nothing to boost his confidence that she was not an imposter he attempted to hide his disquieting thoughts and stated lamely i harry potter her eyes twinkled slightly again i am relieved to hear that if i had accidentally nabbed dudley dursley instead i d never hear the end of it she peered at him closely he was quiet and nervous in her assessment she was unsure why she pointed to a bag of clothes in the foot well of the back seat could you hand me those and you are welcome to get in the front seat harry grabbed the bag and moved to the front as he handed her the bag he saw a wand for the first time she murmured an incantation and suddenly she was dressed in the clothes from the bag jeans and a short sleeved top the business suit was now in the bag whew i hate stuffy clothes now i am back in my element harry was silent he was nervously waiting for the other shoe to drop it just couldntbe this easy to escape the clutches of the dursleys something had to be amiss right arinna took a deep breath well i sure you have a lot of questions so would you like to start or should i launch into the entire story from the beginning summoning his courage harry turned and looked right into her eyes who exactly are you working for he asked coldly arinna was taken aback she should have realized the kid would be paranoid he had every right to be but how had she aroused his suspicions well using words like kidnapping and nabbed probably didnthelp suggested her mind she took another deep breath go slowly she told herself dontfreak him out too late countered another part of her mind i am here as a favor to your headmaster albus dumbledore a small group of people whom he trusts came up with this little plan to get you out and it was felt that i was the best person to execute said plan why didntprofessor dumbledore little warning get to me in time did you have anything to do with that ah so that where i slipped stupid mistake rinna they had warned you he was sharp witted she leveled her gaze at him yes i afraid i did harry made to get out of the car but she grabbed his arm with lightning reflexes wait up and let me explain not unless you can convince me you are not working for voldemort she did not flinch at the sound of the name harry heart stopped for a moment you re bungling it she screamed at herself she let go of his arm and leaned back into her seat she tried to appear non threatening harry she sighed something in the sound of her voice made him stop his fumbling at the door latch was it sadness pain he shook his head to clear his thoughts as she started to speak i am not working for that effing bastard voldemort she said fiercely i made the mistake of offering to deliver dumbledore letter myself when it became clear that the owls werentreaching you i didntcount on that shit of an aunt of yours and her pig husband not ever letting you out of the house i finally decided to just deliver it when i got there i sorry harry but i seriously underestimated how you would react it makes perfect sense that you d be suspicious of me what with all you ve dealt with where voldemort is concerned and with your recent experience of being hunted by sirius black her voice hitched ever so slightly she paused to breathe he wanted to protest no sirius wasnthunting me but the niggling thought interrupted again she said voldemort name without nary a stutter twice he grabbed for the door latch again wait wait she said desperately i can prove to you that i am a friend not a foe again he stopped at the tone in her voice part of his brain was berating him run while you can idiot but he turned and looked at her her green eyes were wild with concern how he asked she reached for the glove box and pulled out a photograph she silently handed it to harry he looked down at it and saw two teenaged girls both with long red hair and green eyes at first you would think them sisters because of the similarity in the hair and eye color but on second glance it became obvious that these two had completely different features the one with almond shaped eyes and a smattering of freckles was his mother the one with big eyes and porcelain skin and delicate features was clearly a younger version of the woman sitting next to him he watched as the two girls laughed hugged each other and then mugged for the camera the picture spoke of deep friendship and love frivolity and hope a bond of sisterhood arinna spoke in a near whisper your mum was my dearest friend 7 a new definition of family chapter 10 aftermath disclaimer here a big surprise i dontown any of jk rowling characters they do however seem to want to play around in my head take me hostage and make me write about them hence this story any characters or places or book titles you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my fertile and fevered imagination a n you may have heard by now that fanfiction dot net has supposedly made a new rule against authors writing responses to their reviewers in their chapters and that some authors have had their stories deleted as a result i went back and edited all my chappies and took out the review responses it makes me sad because i want to show my appreciation for those of you who review sorry if you got a bunch of chapter alerts in your inboxes i had to repost each chapter and now a brief recap of where we left off and on with the show her eyes traveled up his body taking in the ragged clothes the too thin frame unkempt hair and beard he was a stranger then she reached his eyes stormy pools of cerulean blue swirling with emotions that she knew she did not want to name she sucked in her breath sharply sirius hullo rinna the silence between them was heavy and the air itself felt weighted with heartache and recrimination i didntknow if i d ever see you again she too had thought she d never see him again but when he had escaped from azkaban she had lived her days in dread of just such an encounter what would she say to him how could she explain what she had done or more accurately how could she explain without summoning the feelings she was desperately trying to keep at bay she whispered i m i sorry i can t i cantstay she shouldered past him he reached out to her brushing his hand across her arm as she passed but she didntstop rinna his voice was threaded with reproach and longing and desperation she stopped as if jerked by the end of a chain his next words thrust clear to the core of her heart you broke my heart rinna her head dropped and her eyes slid shut i know i broke mine too she turned and dragged her eyes back up to his he deserves an explanation rinna in a voice barely a decibel above a whisper she began to speak he wanted you the dark lord dontyou see i had to do it i i couldn t she took a deep breath i could not i would not allow your feelings for me to be used as the bait to lure you in sirius frowned she continued her eyes pleading for him to understand if you had thought i was being threatened in any way you would have done anything to protect me i knew that if you no longer cared about me so you did it to save me his voice was thick with accusation and pain you didnttrust me enough to tell me the truth rinna what happened to your faith in me what happened to your faith in what we had together his eyes his presence his words shook her very being like a tremor shakes the earth she stood helplessly as each memory and emotion associated with sirius black rose like a wave and battered at her defenses relentlessly until each surge joined together and decimated her fortress walls like a tsunami levels a seawall sirius the thought of losing you was killing me you were never in any danger of losing me he cried what happened to you rinna did you throw away your discernment your common sense how in the bloody hell would breaking our engagement keep you from losing me his voice grew louder in anger explain the logic in that rinna because i sure as hell want to know he saw the look in her eyes and knew he was going too far he couldnthelp himself as the anguish and anger he d felt and nurtured for thirteen years erupted the irony of course is that it was these feelings that helped keep you sane in azkaban she did in fact save you by breaking your heart rinna bowed her head knowing she deserved every iota of his wrath but that knowledge did not stop the guilt from striking like a thunderclap her citadel of safety she had so carefully crafted around her heart had been swept away there was no protection from the pain and guilt and the full weight of her actions crashed in on her crushing away her breath and threatening her sanity there is no way you can adequately explain to him why you did what you did it will take a miracle for him to forgive you the force of her emotions had driven her to her knees her face in her hands breath coming in ragged gasps sirius watched her crumple to the ground and felt his heart twist heaven help him but he loved her still as angry and hurt as he was even now he loved her sirius knelt next to her in concern she lifted her head and looked in his eyes dark like sapphires with emotion he could identify what he saw in the depths of her eyes at that moment after his many years in azkaban he recognized the look of despair she began to speak voice weary and resigned merlin knows i loved you sirius every word i spoke to you that day was a lie she broke off with a sob her hand flew to her mouth and she shook her head unable to continue perhaps it was the movement of her head or maybe an errant shaft of late afternoon sun had escaped but a red sparkle at her throat caught sirius attention his eyes dropped then widened as he took in the ruby pendant she wore without thinking his hand reached out to touch it and he heard the sharp inhalation of breath as his fingers made contact with her skin his eyes slid back up to hers and he saw tears pooling there you still have it he questioned hoarsely she nodded unable to trust herself to speak why he wondered i could not bear to part with it she managed in a quiet strained voice he let go of the necklace but kept his eyes on it where it sat scintillating on her breastbone he considered the words she had left unsaid which mutely reverberated like an aphonic shout in the silence between them and spoke louder than her answer ever could they knelt there next to each other perfectly still for an eternity or perhaps just a few moments until he held out his hand and lifted her up to her feet she couldntlook him in the face anymore so she looked at her hand in his instead he did not let go at last after so many years he knew the truth sirius wasntsure what he had expected from this encounter but the warmth of her hand exploded into his awareness this hand that he had longed to feel in his again had dreamt about caressing his face his body for so many years now a sudden shift in the atmosphere became noticeable like the change in barometric pressure before a thunderstorm the air between them almost visibly twanged with tension the same tension that tugged at him deep in his belly rinna felt the change too her heart flipped painfully in her chest sirius had always been her weakness one smile one glimpse into the depths of his eyes and she would do anything he asked never regretting it even for a moment his laugh filled her with happiness his sexy lopsided smile made her melt his sweet words whispered in her ear made her feel safe no that was how it used to be she told herself that was how it was before you broke faith with him before you foreswore your promises and dreams with him she had only herself to blame he was right she hadnttrusted him enough and you have the audacity to ache for him now you arentdeserving of him guilt pain despair the assault on her heart was more than she could bear she had no defenses now no hope of deflecting the emotions that bombarded her and threatened to push her to push her over she knew knew that if she was to survive this unintended encounter with sirius black she would need to make good her escape now she yanked her hand from his as if his touch burned her i sorry i so very sorry she whispered i need to go i can t i can t the pain and guilt are too much for me i a coward i ve got to go dontlet her go this time his heart screamed at him rinna his voice was raspy desperate she interrupted him yours was not the only heart broken she said softly to him i i died that day she turned and bolted dontlet her go without conscious thought sirius legs began to move as words tore from his throat ruby wait please don t he thought he saw a hitch in her gait a hesitation at the use of his endearment for her and he called out again ruby please but it was too late he heard a pop and she was gone no his hands balled into fists in frustration as he fell to his knees in the soft grass stunned remus lupin had stood in open mouthed shock as he watched the scene play out his immediate reaction was to apparate after rinna and find her and make sure she was all right the look on her face had been frighteningly reminiscent of what he d seen in her eyes so long ago but the logical part of his mind reminded him there was no way to know where rinna had gone he sighed in frustration and looked at sirius on his knees on the lawn remus lupin knew that ultimately at least in his mind matters of the heart came second to the sacred bond of deepest friendship and his oldest friend needed him he moved quickly to sirius side and crouched next to him peering at his face sirius looked utterly lost remus took his arm and tried to haul him to his feet come on padfoot he said gently but firmly suddenly harry was at sirius other arm assisting harry help me get him to the porch please remus indicated the porch steps with his chin harry nodded in understanding and the two were successful in getting sirius to his feet they walked him to the steps and sat him down each taking the spot on either side hermione and ron came and sat beyond harry unsure what to do remus felt strangely detached from the aching in his chest he would have to deal with it later he had always been the one to pick up the pieces after any crisis minor or catastrophic in his friends lives it was a skill he d been gifted with keeping his head and knowing how to handle people and he knew he was being called to employ it now he took a deep breath shouldered all his own thoughts and feelings to the side and prepared to do damage control sirius what in merlin name are you doing here he asked why did you come back sirius head snapped up at the question he turned haunted eyes to remus and opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted i afraid that my fault professor harry confessed quietly he looked at his shoes once again ashamed and furious at himself for writing the blasted note to his godfather i sent him a letter asking about rinna sirius made a sharp cutting gesture with his hand it is not harry fault he didntask me to come back when i read that rinna had contacted him i had to make sure harry was safe that she wasn t he looked up at remus again but when i saw her with you i knew she was all right you wouldnthave let her near harry if she wasn t sirius she never would have i couldntbe sure moony i know remus looked at him soberly you need to know what happened after after he faltered then took a deep breath and continued resolutely after lily and james died why didntshe take harry sirius wanted to know she was supposed to take him if i his eyes begged for confirmation that his fianc e had not been a traitor she couldnttake me harry interrupted again she d been captured by voldemort captured and tortured the two men turned to him remus in surprise that harry knew this and sirius completely shocked by what he heard harry looked at remus rinna told me i asked her why she let me go to the dursleys she told me about about being in st mungo after she went his voice trailed off when he saw the horrified look on sirius face sirius turned to remus his eyes frosty with malice the bastard got her remus nodded his expression also hard as steel sirius shot up from the step anger radiating off him in waves he just couldntwait to get his effing hands on her sirius remus said sharply in warning sirius jerked around and saw his friend roll his eyes toward the teens sitting on the steps with their eyes wide taking everything in sirius took a deep breath and ran his hands through his disheveled hair he was so exhausted he wasnteven thinking clearly remus got up and put his hands on sirius shoulder i ll explain everything to you but we need to find a safe place for you to stay he glanced around noting that most of the weasleys had come out to the porch in response to the commotion earlier he locked eyes with molly he saw the expression on her face and shook his head he cantstay here molly arthur cannot afford to be caught harboring a fugitive molly looked at her husband then at the gaunt man standing in her backyard sirius she said kindly harry told us everything is there anything we can do for you name it agreed arthur sirius wearily scrubbed his face with his hand then looked at the weasleys thank you but i not sure he swayed on his feet i sorry i ve been traveling on very little sleep and i cantremember when i ate last his knees buckled and remus steadied him molly clicked her tongue in anger that it get him inside this instant she snapped harry jumped up and took sirius other arm again he starved sleep deprived and has had a nasty shock i am not turning him away arthur her defiant eyes met her husband s i not asking you to molly arthur said mildly and he swung open the kitchen door harry and remus helped sirius up the steps and remus caught molly eye she raised her eyebrows daring him to challenge her authority but he merely smiled slightly at her and nodded i wontargue with you molly at least not for the moment ron hermione and the rest followed them inside sirius was seated at the table and molly placed a huge plate of leftovers in front of him and watched to make sure he started eating when she felt she had adequately mother henned him she stepped over to remus and asked quietly where did rinna go is she all right i not sure he replied worriedly could i use the fireplace i need to make arrangements for sirius and i can see if rinna is home of course do you have any idea where you can take him remus nodded there was one person he could trust one person he could explain the whole debacle to and she would agree to help in a heartbeat at least he hoped she would he stepped into the living room lit the fire and placed his head in it tonks nymphadora tonks was startled to see remus face in her fireplace warning bells went off immediately in her head he was supposed to be at harry birthday party remus what wrong is rinna there he asked in concern no why would she be here she supposed to be at harry party with you she saw remus grimace bloody hell remus is something wrong what happened remus sighed wearily look tonks do you remember the other night when we had dinner what we talked about he saw her nod confusedly he had to be very careful about what he said next well i have a situation here a stray that needs shelter he waited for her to catch his reference her eyes widened in comprehension you mean right he interrupted her i know that it is rather inconvenient to ask given your situation but he needs a safe place to stay remus could see her contemplating the implications of taking sirius in just like arthur she could little afford to be caught aiding wizarding england most notorious renegade but remus was fresh out of ideas he could not take sirius to mundungus fletcher s for obvious reasons the foremost being that mundungus probably wouldnthesitate to turn him in for the reward money tonks looked at him determination in her eyes all right i ll do it but how are we going to get him here unseen remus grinned in relief leave it to me it will be easier than you think expect us later tonight right now tell me what has happened to rinna you ve worried me no end she had an encounter with the stray that upset her remus shrugged apologetically i cantsay more right now tonks could you go to her house and see if she there tonks looked at him in frustration i will but you have a lot of explaining to do remus lupin i will i promise thanks tonks he removed his head from the fireplace and rubbed it he felt a raging headache coming on molly returned to the table to sit and watch with satisfaction as sirius tucked in to the food he looked up at her and remarked your cooking is even better than i remembered molly he realized he was under a great deal of scrutiny since most of the family had sat back down at the table he looked across the table at harry and his friends hey ron how the leg he asked gruffly oh uh it fine never better really was ron surprised answer sirius eyes traveled to ron left all right hermione she nodded then added how buckbeak oh he safe and doing fine sirius looked around the table at the rest of them hullo bill charley he said they nodded to him molly cleared her throat and stepped in to ease the awkwardness those are the twins fred and george they are not usually that pink this is ginny percy is upstairs mum you probably should leave him up there he doesntneed to know we are entertaining sirius black at this particular moment bill suggested right molly agreed she said to sirius the whole family knows the truth the kids were quite certain you were coming here and we didntwant anyone pulling wands first and asking questions later well i appreciate that he said sardonically sirius looked at harry who was sitting across from him at the table harry i sorry but i donthave anything for you for your birthday what harry was incredulous sirius you could be caught and sent back to azkaban how can you be thinking of birthday presents he ran his hand through his hair in frustration why did you come back sirius not that i not glad to see you he added hurriedly but sirius looked at him piercingly i was worried about you he said simply because i mentioned rinna in my letter harry asked sirius nodded i wish i hadntwritten that stupid letter harry lamented if it hadntbeen for that you d never have come back and put yourself back in danger harry mussed his hair more looking very anxious sirius you need to get out of england sirius looked at him with a rueful smile i afraid it is a bit more complicated now harry i have unfinished business to attend to harry countered what with rinna why she broke your heart he felt fiercely protective of his godfather and responsible for putting him in danger someone had to make him see how unreasonable he was being how dangerous it would be for him to stay harry said sirius gently i need to find out what had happened to her i need to know why harry interjected now that he knew it was rinna who had ended the relationship he couldntunderstand why sirius would want to have anything to do with her sirius looked at him for a long moment how could he explain to harry when he barely knew the answer himself i dontknow except for the fact that not a day went by while i was in azkaban that i didntthink of her he looked into his godson worried face harry he said exasperatedly i eluded capture this entire past year i think i quite capable of remaining at large and out of prison arthur slipped into the conversation which brings us back to the question of where you will stay i refuse to bring you and your family into danger arthur besides if i not mistaken i betting that remus is already finagling some solution and if not like i said i am very good at staying hidden as it would happen came a voice from the entry to the kitchen i believe i have plan padfoot well moony that doesntsurprise me in the least sirius grinned tiredly at his old friend hang on said george padfoot and moony as in messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs purveyors of aids to magical mischief makers fred looked stunned as in the marauder map remus and sirius looked at each other slightly wide eyed then back at the twins how do you know about the marauder map asked remus suspiciously looking at harry ron and hermione why we were the ones began fred who gave it to harry finished george what on earth are you all talking about demanded molly what map realization dawned in remus eyes so you re the ones who nicked it from filch yep that us said george cockily we sure owe you a great deal ow george rubbed his shoulder where fred had socked him and glared at his twin who was making odd contortions with his face when george followed his brother eyes in the direction they were rolling his gaze fell upon his mother very red and irate visage george realized his faux pas and gulped what did you nick molly began dangerously but she was interrupted by a groan from sirius who had placed his head in both hands holding it as if in a great deal of pain oh sirius molly cried as she rushed over to him are you all right i sorry molly but i just exhausted and my head is starting to hurt sirius said miserably head still down in his hands i think i just need some rest he chanced a glance at the twins all the kids saw him wink conspiratorially right then remus said in a brisk take charge tone i think i d better be getting him to a safe place he placed his hands on sirius shoulders that is if you think you can handle a tandem apparition sirius sirius nodded and then gripped his head again for effect arthur molly everyone thank you for your hospitality said remus and happy birthday harry sirius stood and looked at harry happy birthday harry we ll be in touch and dontworry about me i ll be fine he shook arthur hand goodnight arthur he stopped in front of molly took her hand and bowed over it thank you molly for all your kindness i really appreciate it molly squeezed his hand and looked into his sunken haunted eyes i wish there was more i could do for you sirius you ve done plenty i wontallow you to risk yourselves anymore on my account he squeezed her hand back then followed remus to the door he was surprised to see harry already there blocking his exit harry locked eyes with sirius for a long moment and then the two of them moved toward each other for a hug one of the quick manly kinds that involve a few slaps on the back harry stepped back and said stay safe sirius that can be your birthday present to me okay sirius reached out and ruffled harry hair affectionately right and without another word he followed lupin out the two men walked silently out the side gate and into the wooded area behind the house that was a fine bit of dissembling you did back there padfoot remus finally commented do you reckon we distracted molly from the twins gaffe sirius asked are you kidding you know what she like was remus reply so she hasntmellowed out over the years sirius asked remus responded with a snort and a dry hardly those two boys are goners then sirius shook his head sadly then he stumbled remus shot out a hand to steady him as sirius said i hate to say but it wasntreally an act moony i feel completely knackered they stopped walking and remus pulled from his pocket a ribbon taken from the flotsam of torn gift wrapping that had been left in the weasley living room here what we ll do i wasntjoking about the tandem apparition pads you need to transform and i will apparate with you in my arms he transfigured the ribbon into a collar and leash why asked sirius slightly suspicious because we are apparating into suburban london and i dontwant you seen nor any trace of you apparating to be found where are we going sirius inquired to your cousin s andromeda s no to her daughter s nymphadora tonks tonks opened her door to find remus lupin standing on her landing with a large black dog sitting by him she cast a puzzled look to the dog who thumped his tail and opened his mouth in a tongue lolling grin her eyes returned to remus begging the question may we come in tonks remus inquired softly right right of course she exclaimed regaining her composure and standing aside to let them in she followed them into the room saying it completely warded remus i set extra spells after we spoke at her words the large dog changed into the thin rag tag form of sirius black hullo tonks he said he looked her up and down you have certainly grown up since i last saw you to her credit she recovered quickly from the shock of finding out her fugitive relative was an animagus i was ten sirius she retorted acerbically of course i ve grown up her voice softened how are you cousin quite dead on my feet actually to be honest tonks flew into a flurry of activity have you eaten shall i make some tea here sit down put your feet up she pushed him to the couch and unceremoniously shoved him down throwing a ratty knitted afghan over his legs what can i get you anything remus grinned at the sight of tonks going all motherly all of a sudden sirius looked like he didntknow what hit him but managed to say i ve eaten but some tea would be nice tonks whirled and immediately tripped over her own feet she stumbled to the kitchen and the two men heard the teakettle hit the floor followed by a few muttered oaths remus sat down on a chair still grinning sirius looked at him a bit wide eyed i take it she hasntoutgrown the clumsiness then he queried one of her many endearing qualities that remus smirked sirius raised an eyebrow you know her well then remus remembered that sirius was completely in the dark we became reacquainted through rinna he explained the two of them were flat mates for two years sirius digested this rather startling news he pondered what he d already learned of rinna this afternoon and realized that he had not considered that she would have continued on changing and maturing seeing his young cousin a grown woman brought that fact home neither rinna nor remus had spent twelve years in a state of arrested development or suspended animation if you will as he had the thought struck fear into his heart what if they had changed what if they were not the people he remembered anymore i think you had better fill me in now moony he said gravely tonks managed to get the teacups and teapot to the living room in one piece and served it without scalding anyone so she curled up in the remaining armchair with satisfaction and listened as remus related to sirius an abridged version of events regarding rinna since the deaths of the potters remus watched as sirius struggled to keep his eyes open and found himself punctuating his narrative with the phrase i can tell you more about that tomorrow more and more often finally he stopped and said padfoot there is something inherently creepy about an unconscious person sleeping with their eyes open so what do you say i let you close yours and we ll finish this tomorrow sirius was about to protest that no he wanted to hear more but he realized that he was looking at two very blurry remuses and conceded defeat he stretched himself out on the couch and closed his aching eyes unfortunately just as he was about to slip into unconsciousness the thought that had been scrabbling away in the depths of his mind ever since he saw rinna turn and run from him finally broke through to the surface his eyes shot open remus he croaked instantly his friend was at his side what is it sirius remus i came back because of her i cantget her out of my head remus ignored the spasm around his heart i know sirius it was clear that sirius was now beyond merely exhausted and had slipped into delirium what if it too late if i ve lost her forever bloody hell moony sirius grabbed at remus arm and looked at him wild eyed what if there is another bloke time seemed to stop for remus lupin as he stared at sirius hand on his forearm and blinked this is it now your chance to fight for your claim on rinna heart said one part of his mind the part that had been quietly waiting for such a time as now but the more rational side of him pointed out you have no claim on rinna heart you know she is really in love with sirius but she loves you the first voice spoke you know she does yes she does was the answer she does love me but not in the way she loves sirius and sirius is still in love with her they deserve another chance at happiness remus lifted his eyes to sirius face and said quietly but clearly there may have been another bloke but he out of the picture now are you sure moony sirius searched his friend face for the confirmation he needed to squelch the disturbing thought that had been tormenting his heart and mind remus nodded resolutely sealing his fate i sure a sigh of relief escaped sirius lips and his eyes slid closed as his mind allowed sleep to finally claim him remus turned away a shuttered expression on his tired face tonks who hadntmissed the exchange walked over to where remus was standing looking morosely into the fire she gently touched his shoulder and handed him a newly warmed cup of tea come join me on the balcony remus she entreated let talk he followed her out did you find rinna he asked i flooed her twice but no answer damn it he swore turning around to go back inside i ve got to find her tonks grabbed his arm hang on remus she fine we both know what she does when she is upset she turned him around and led him to one of the ugly dark green plastic chairs that thankfully had a garishly striped cushion on it he took a seat as she continued she is going to go for a run or beat the stuffing out of a boxing dummy or both remus frowned in concern i dontknow tonks the look on her face when she ran off she ran off tonks snapped in surprise you failed to mention that detail what happened sirius showed up unexpectedly at the weasleys and immediately confronted her about breaking off the engagement they had a bit of a row at least sirius was yelling but she seemed to just i dontknow it was like all the calm detachment she perfected over the years disappeared he looked up at tonks eyes dark with worry the look on her face it reminded me of how she looked that time when they told her what sirius allegedly did when she went mental you mean tonks whispered feeling alarm stir in her gut at remus words i worried about how she is handling this tonks i worried she is off somewhere drinking herself into oblivion tonks studied his face her eyes tracing the lines of worry above his brows you love her dontyou she asked softly he jerked and eyed her warily of course i love her he replied a little too hastily she one of my dearest friends she leaned back in her chair and sighed affixing him with a look of disdain oh please a person has to have a certain level of intelligence to become an auror you know dontinsult mine remus looked at her but didntspeak she leaned forward i ve known you well for three years and every time i ve been with you both the chemistry between you two has been palpable i heard what you told sirius she leaned back again never taking her eyes from his i happen to know that the only bloke in her life is you i just hadntrealized you two had actually hooked up remus winced we didntactually uh hook up as you so eloquently put it he said tartly tonks arched an eyebrow and looked at him with an iron hard gaze that he would from now on forever classify as her auror look he squirmed so what exactly is the nature of your relationship then she grilled him remus realized he had made a grave error in judgment about this seemingly clumsy innocuous witch before him beneath her klutzy good natured exterior beat the heart of a ruthless interrogator he immediately felt sorry for any perpetrators of crime she ever chanced to apprehend remus she prompted you are like a bulldog he snapped in exasperation it was nothing her eyebrow arched again well there was some snogging her other eyebrow joined the first all right you horrible wench there was a lot of snogging if you must know but it doesntmatter now why because it isntme she wants it sirius she studied him and you know this how because it his name she calls in her sleep as soon as he said it he realized his slip it not what you re thinking he amended hastily snogging and sleeping with her my my professor she clucked her tongue enjoying his discomfiture immensely he stood up and threw his arms in the air in vexation we were drunk and ended up in bed together at the look on her face he realized that once more the words came out wrong he smacked his forehead with his hand oh shit he took a deep breath and fixed her with a stern glare we were fully clothed nothing happened you he pointed his finger at her should get your mind out of the gutter she kicked her feet up onto the plastic table in front of her and smirked saucily at him but why it so nice and comfy here in the gutter you really should try it sometime professor she purred tonks why are you doing this she jumped up with another mercurial change of mood and strode over to him she put her hand on his shoulder i know what you are doing you are making your noble sacrifice stepping aside and denying yourself something you ve always wanted for the sake of your friends it what you do remus he looked away from her intense gaze was this how it was at school too did you deny your feelings for her then because of sirius she asked gently remus pulled away from her i a werewolf tonks he said bitterly what do i have to offer any woman really she walked around him to face him again hey she put her hand to his cheek and to her surprise he didntshy away you as much as the next bloke deserve the love of a good woman she smiled gently at him i wish you would realize that she leaned forward and kissed his other cheek astounding him as to what you have to offer most women i know are looking for someone who is kind and good a gentleman who will respect them and cherish them someone like you remus she rubbed her thumb across his cheek as she removed her hand and then turned for the door to the flat remus was so stunned he was unable to move where are you going he whispered to try to find rinna she told him stay here with sirius he needs you right now remus stayed on the balcony for a long time after she left his hand on his cheek where she kissed him and his heart churning with emotions the trio found themselves out on the back porch as harry natal day stretched into evening and the stars began to twinkle overhead hermione cast an appraising eye over harry as he sat slumped on the old wicker loveseat staring off into the woods beyond the garden she was sitting on the porch railing leaning against the post that supported the roof ron had pulled up a chair in front of harry the silence had long ago moved from merely uncomfortable to interminable hermione could take it no longer with a dramatic sigh she swung her legs down hopped off the rail and moved to take a seat next to harry really harry it wasnta total loss this whole day it was quite a splendid birthday for the most part dontyou think she cajoled ron took his cue from her yeah mate the quidditch games were ruddy brilliant harry knew what they were trying to do cheer him up he could count on them for that just like he could count on them keeping him company for an hour as he sat in a funk while the sky grew dark he could also count on them listening to him telling them exactly where the day went wrong without thinking he was a whiny brat well without telling him they thought he was a whiny brat anyway he gave them a half smile you re right it was a spectacular day right up to the point where sirius showed up no wait i take that back right up until the point that sirius name was brought up over cake and ice cream and rinna got all shirty well you cantreally blame her harry ron pointed out mum was practically suggesting that she and sirius set the wedding date and in reality she had broken up with him and then the two of them had their showdown harry added yeah hermione said softly that was pretty awful the little group lapsed into silence again harry looking at the weathered floor sullenly it was he who shattered the quiet in a shaken voice i cantbelieve that she broke his heart that she hurt him oh harry hermione said as she laid a comforting hand on his shoulder ron leaned forward his arms across his legs fingers laced together a worried expression on his face neither knew what to say harry gave a mirthless little laugh there was a moment there he indicated the shadowy spot on the lawn where the scene had taken place when i thought they were going to get back together he ran his hand through his hair and then she ran off and i got this pain in my chest i wonder if that was what sirius was feeling like you know harry ron said helplessly harry voice rose a little ever since bill took the charm off those photos i ve been staring at them and thinking about them reuniting and then we could live together like a family and now i dontthink that will ever happen his voice quivered and he swallowed hard hermione let out a little sob and pulled him to her side laying his head on her shoulder and resting the side of her head against his ron reached out and gripped his knee in sympathy they did not want to encourage this fantasy not after what they had seen that afternoon but neither did they want to dash his hopes by this time they were getting used to the long silences so they remained there providing what comfort they could a long time later molly stepped to the back door to send the three of them to bed but when she saw the tableau she thought better of disturbing them and instead set about to turning off the lights in the house the kids had not realized how late it had gotten harry lifted his head from the warm comfort of hermione and looked at his two best friends thanks he said hoarsely ron stood up and yawned hugely you coming up mate he asked harry in a bit right well good night harry mione night they answered in unison harry stood up and stretched then offered hermione his hand he pulled her up from the seat ready to go yeah i just wish i could give you one more birthday present she said as she squeezed his hand really what that i wish i could make you feel better she smiled sadly at him then stood on her tiptoes to kiss him on the forehead good night harry he found himself reaching for her as she turned away and he took her hand and pulled her back to him i always feel better when you are around mione he said seriously as he gazed into her dark eyes her breath caught as he reached up and brushed a stray strand of hair behind her ear they held each other eyes for several moments longer than they should have he leaned in a little and her breath hitched again as she tilted her chin up harry felt warm all over and he imagined he felt her pulse quicken where his fingers still gripped her wrist their faces moved closer together as they held each other captive with their eyes until their noses bumped painfully hermione gasped oh sorry harry said embarrassed and he smiled uncertainly as hermione let out a nervous giggle it okay she said after an awkward pause she added well good night harry and this time kissed him on the cheek harry grinned like a fool hermione stopped at the door to the house and turned happy birthday harry she said shyly and then slipped inside harry fingers touched the spot on his cheek where her lips had just been and he smiled happily his worries about his godparents momentarily forgotten as he made his way in the house and to bed a n please let me know what you thought of this chapter i d really like to hear your opinion thanks to everyone who responded to my

leave your review cheerio 16 a new definition of family chapter 11 coping disclaimer here a big surprise i dontown any of jk rowling characters they do however seem to want to play around in my head take me hostage and make me write about them hence this story i also do not own jack daniels believe me i checked my cupboard oh and i dontown the brand names jack daniels or guinness either any characters or places you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my wild little imagination the cemetery was washed with the warm late afternoon light that gave an orangey yellow glow to the white marble grave markers had her thoughts not been completely jumbled she would have been grateful for all those emergency apparition drills she d been subjected to long ago each order member had to have a spot they could apparate to under any circumstances whether exhausted injured threatened or whatever it was that ingrained skill that had brought her here and it was a good thing for in the state of mind she d been when she left the weasleys so unceremoniously she could have easily splinched herself but rinna was not thinking about these things when she arrived in the northwest corner of the cemetery in fact she barely registered the marble markers she stood in front of her mind played the scene she d just been part of over and over and it didntmatter if she shut her eyes or not she could not make her brain stop she shook her head with a sound that was something of a cross between an exclamation of frustration and a sob and crouched down unconsciously spreading her hand on the cool marble in front of her her hand made circles on the smooth stone in time to the words chanting mockingly in her head you broke my heart you broke my heart you suddenly her fingers slipped into a cut in the marble startling her back to the present her eyes opened to find her fingertips in the a of the first name on the marker to the left albert lau loong her eyes jerked to the right avril dunlevy lau her breath hitched as she looked at the headstones cheerily bathed in creamy warm light if she had been looking for a place to soothe her tumultuous emotions this was the last place she should have come she stood up resolutely but her eyes flickered down once more to the names on the marble merlin how she missed them she wanted to feel her mother arms around her and hear her gentle cultured voice telling her everything would be all right she wanted to hear her stepfather lilting speech imparting wise words to her in his accented english mum ah loong i miss you she whispered she felt the familiar twitch the urge for physical release from the intense emotions she was experiencing her legs wanted to move to run to run away fast and hard until the muscles in her thighs and calves burned with exertion and she was so exhausted she couldntthink or listen to her thoughts anymore she looked down at her feet bah sandals were not suitable she would have to go home and change yes that what she would do there was nothing for her in this place save painful reminders of tragic loss to further endanger her fragile state of mind trainers she needed her trainers she closed her eyes blocking out the image of the cemetery and disappeared with a pop usually the pounding of her feet on the path would take on a rhythm that seemed to soothe away any seething anxious thoughts and helped rein in her emotions tonight however as the sun started to set her footfalls seemed to taunt her you broke my heart you broke my heart you she picked up her pace and changed her stride hoping the new cadence would cancel the tormenting chant or that she might at least get a nice piercing stitch in her side to distract her oh she got the stitch alright but sirius words continued to echo through her head this is no help she shook her head as a horse might shake off an offending fly trying to dislodge the voice in her mind but only succeeded in throwing herself off balance she landed on the side of the park path hard her eyes closed in reaction to the pain of her scraped hands and knees and she immediately saw a pair of indigo eyes filled with hurt and confusion damn it was no use she picked herself up and began to make her way home she shoved her way through the door and went immediately to the kitchen she knew what she needed something that would drown out the words and pictures looping through her mind over and over she needed to just not think for a while not feel for a while part of her hated herself even as she reached into the cupboard this is another sign of weakness you know she determinedly pulled down the fire whiskey decanter it was nearly empty what the hell and what happened to the top then she remembered drinking the whiskey with remus and that she had shattered the top just a few days ago was it really a few days it seems like so long ago never mind there is bound to be another bottle but her search through the back of the cupboard brought up only a half used bottle of cooking sherry damn she turned to the refrigerator there should be a bottle of wine chilling but no that was consumed the other night with remus and dorrie sure enough she pulled the bottle out of the waste bin and set it on the table where it mocked her with its emptiness she returned to the fridge and her hand reached further back encountering a bottle what she pulled it out and found herself holding a bottle of guinness ugh where did that come from then she remembered that dumbledore was rather fond of the thick muggle beer and she had bought some for the strategy meetings earlier that summer she laid out her meager stock on the table unfortunately it would not be sufficient and none of the bottles had refilling charms on them but maybe if she drank them fast enough my stars i pathetic and desperate and yet her newfound obsession with alcohol was taking her mind off her larger problem somewhat she sighed and reached for the beer couldnthurt to try she set down the now empty whiskey bottle next to the now empty sherry bottle annoyed that she and remus had drunk so much of it last month she froze oh sweet merlin remus her heart gave a little spasm she groaned as a sandy haired hazel eyed face moved to join the other desultory images that had suddenly sprung again to the forefront of her mind her stomach chose that moment to reject the horrid concoction of alcohol she d poured into it with a strangled sob she sprinted for the loo nymphadora tonks stepped out of the fireplace into rinna living room and surveyed the premises she had been alarmed enough by remus words that she was determined to do more than poke her head into the fireplace this time respect for her friend privacy be damned nothing seemed amiss here so she stepped into the kitchen and froze oh no remus was right she thought as she inventoried the contents of the kitchen table a decanter of fire whiskey a bottle of wine a funny stout bottle of that muggle beer and a bottle of fat friar cooking sherry all were completely empty bloody hell had she drunk all of that tonks shook her head she thought she knew her friend very well but apparently not well better find her and assess the damage rinna house appeared empty even her bedroom then tonks heard a muffled moan coming from the bathroom and she moved toward the door pushing it open gently fearing the worst it was not a pretty sight her red headed friend was lying down with her face on the floor in front of the toilet one hand still resting on the rim of the bowl eyes closed and breathing erratically tonks frantically tried to remember the spell to counter the effects of alcohol poisoning oh shit rinna eyes snapped open and she rolled onto her back squinting up at tonks through tear swollen eyes what you re drunk rinna groaned and sat up i wish she heaved herself up to standing and went to the sink for her toothbrush she was walking awfully well for someone completely pissed tonks was confused you re not drunk rinna looked at tonks reflection in the mirror sadly unfortunately distressingly no not for lack of trying mind you but but what about all those bottles on the table rinna snorted and finished brushing her teeth she turned and ticked her points on her fingers the wine empty from the other night the sherry half full the guinness nasty stuff that all right that was full and the whiskey only one and a quarter jiggers none of which lingered in my stomach for even five minutes before i honked it up into the toilet well i should say disgusting combination that any self respecting stomach would reject that out of hand tonks replied a slight smile playing at her mouth now that she was over her fright she turned in the doorway as rinna walked past her and into the bedroom well if you haventbeen on a bender these last few hours where have you been rinna arched an eyebrow at her didntthey teach you the fine art of observation in auror training dorrie she asked dramatically waving her hand down her body tonks took in the track pants t shirt and trainers i ve been running tonks flopped dramatically onto the comfy armchair in the corner and sighed give me a break dunnie i ve spent the last few hours dealing with an anxious werewolf who was pacing around my flat worried to death that you were drinking yourself into oblivion and i feeling a bit frazzled after that fright you just gave me on your bathroom floor she felt it was wise to avoid mentioning that her renegade cousin was also staying in her flat at that moment so that where remus is then rinna whispered she sat on the bed and leaned forward elbows on her knees and head in her hands i just completely left him and ran when sirius showed up dunnie tonks groaned getting up and moving to sit next to her on the bed is there anything i can do do you want to talk rinna flopped backward onto the mattress no i dontwant to talk about it i just want it all to go away tonks joined her on her back on the bed rinna turned to look at her i hoping you brought some of my favorite muggle stuff tonks turned on her side and propped her head up on her hand eyebrows raised that american whiskey jack daniels well no sorry luv there will be no fling with captain jack for you tonight rinna eyed her grumpily what happened to the nymphadora tonks method of coping alcohol hmmm no it is the nymphadora tonks formula for coping and you are forgetting the formula alcohol dancing and men she cracked a grin you should know dunnie as an excellent potions maker yourself that ingredients must be combined to be effective especially ingredients that are potentially lethal on their own rinna let out a rueful snort well that explains why my pathetic attempt at drowning my sorrows failed she said dryly she grew quiet staring at the ceiling sure you dontwant to talk about it tonks inquired softly rinna let out a long sigh but didntanswer finally she rolled over and grabbed the pillows from the head of the bed offering one to tonks and hugging the other to herself as she rolled on her side it was awful she whispered as tears filled her eyes it was bad enough knowing i had broken his heart but to hear the words come from his own mouth she trailed off she looked into tonks sympathetic eyes caramel brown today and was suddenly grateful that her young friend had come over her words began pouring out like dogs loosed before the hunt he said i hadnttrusted him enough and he right i was such an idiot i believed i had everything under control and it was just a huge illusion i played right into the enemy hands damnit she slammed her fist into the bed i shattered our lives and for nothing i dontthink he will ever be able to forgive me for that you dontthink so asked tonks thinking of sirius words to remus well there was a moment dorrie when i was running out of the weasleys yard when i thought i heard no i must have imagined it she shook her head tonks took her arm and shook it gently imagined what tell me rinna took a deep breath afraid of voicing the one thin gossamer strand of hope she d held on to these last few hours lest it snap and float away she suspected this was the only tenuous barrier standing between her and another mental breakdown she closed her eyes and murmured i thought i heard him say ruby wait then i think he said it again as i apparated ruby tonks queried puzzled it was his pet name for me she rolled onto her back again why would he call me that why ask me to wait she sat up and turned her anguished gaze to her friend tonks looked at rinna as she sat up too and prayed she would say the right thing she had never dreamed once in a million years that she would be the one playing the big sister role she took a deep breath to calm her nerves she was at least fairly certain that rinna had heard what she thought sirius had called out as she fled it made sense with what she had overheard in her apartment why indeed perhaps you left the conversation too soon tears flowed from rinna eyes as she spoke hushed and hesitant i had to leave i had to all these years i ve been able to take any errant memory of him any stray thought and lock it away so it wouldntburn away at my heart but when i saw him face to face when i looked into his eyes oh merlin his eyes she sobbed tonks put an arm around her reassuringly she sniffled loudly and continued i couldnthide any of it away any more it was like like trying to contain a whirlwind impossible it all came rushing in on me all of it how i had betrayed him betrayed us she tried to catch her shuddering breath how i would never have him again because of what i did i had to go i had to i couldnttake it anymore it hurt too much she was crying so hard now that she could no longer speak tonks pulled her into her arms and stroked her back shhh shush now let it out tonks rocked her anguished friend back and forth and held her as she cried she had never in the time she d known her seen rinna cry like this finally the sobbing ceased sorry came rinna apology muffled by tonks shoulder what the hell do you have to be sorry for after all the times i cried on your shoulder about stupid men rinna snorted a quick subdued laugh and pulled away tonks reached out to rinna face with the edge of a pillow case drying her tears hey rinna luv i dontthink the main question is whether or not sirius can forgive you for what you did rinna looked at her in surprise what what do you mean i think the question is can you forgive yourself arinna dunlevy stood nervously at the base of the steps leading up to the front porch of the burrow a box of biscuits from her favorite bakery in her hand anxiously shifting her weight from one leg to the other she looked up at the front door with trepidation she was sure that she was not emotionally ready to go in and face the interrogation that was sure to come from molly after that little performance in the backyard yesterday afternoon however she had been raised in a very proper wizarding home and good manners had been drilled into her from an early age and her conscience demanded that she apologize for the appalling breach of social etiquette she had perpetrated when she ran away yesterday she sighed if she was smart she would turn and leave now she was under the assault of many different emotions swirling around in her mind and really she was no better off than she had been last night try as she might to take each memory captive and tamp it down into the recesses of her heart her mind refused to have any part of that old method of survival it was ironic that just when she needed it the most the coping mechanism she had relied on since childhood really if she was honest with herself had failed her and so she stood there thoughts of sirius and remus making her heart ache angry with herself and full of shame for her behavior she climbed up the steps hissing at the discomfort she was already feeling in her body from the quidditch game yesterday but the aching in her muscles was nothing compared to the aching she felt in her heart she was too raw i should leave numbly she knocked on the door suddenly she found herself caught up in molly embrace oh thank heavens you are all right i was very worried about you luv she was pulled into the kitchen i have the teakettle going we ll have a spot of tea rinna silently handed her the bakery box oh splendid these will go nicely as she bustled about with the preparations molly glanced and saw that rinna was still standing in the middle of the kitchen come sit sit dontjust stand there let drink our tea and then i will find your things that you left here yesterday molly i am so sorry for running off like that rinna said miserably molly waved her off rinna it was understandable after the shock you had now sit rinna sat how much of that debacle did you witness anyway she asked molly poured the tea pretty much all of it i d say enough to get the gist of what had happened between you and sirius rinna groaned and dropped her head in her hands i had no idea that he would show up like that i so sorry that you that everybody had to witness that scene she said with what sounded suspiciously like a sob molly put a sympathetic hand on rinna shoulder are you all right dearie rinna shook her head do you want to talk about it rinna shook her head again molly sighed and made a moue of frustration well have you had anything to eat rinna shook her head once more i not terribly hungry she said dully her stomach was feeling the effects of her emotional turmoil whatever molly was going to say in reply was interrupted by the banging of the back door as four teenaged bodies flung it open and plowed inside flushed and sweaty from being outdoors and talking animatedly the chatter died out when they saw the kitchen was occupied rinna hastily stood up hullo harry uh hi came harry hesitant reply he was surprised to see her there i uh came to tell you i sorry for running off like i did yesterday she said uncomfortably oh okay the awkward silence pressed in on her she turned to molly right well i need to get home so i ll just get my things and just a minute dear i ll go get them molly assured her sensing rinna discomfort rinna hastily followed molly out of the kitchen wait rinna called harry as he ran after her causing his godmother to jump she was so wound up she turned to him puzzled i sorry i didnttell you that sirius was coming rinna brows furrowed into a frown hang on you knew he was coming harry nodded shamefaced how could you have possibly known that she asked carefully harry stammered oh uh the first night i met you i wrote him a letter asking about you you wrote him a letter about me she repeated faintly harry hung his head a little and nodded and he wrote me back he wrote you back she asked incredulously and he told you he was coming to the burrow harry scuffed his trainer on the floor he cleared his throat and glanced at ron and hermione who were pointedly looking anywhere but at rinna he was regretting opening his big mouth well not exactly rinna didntmiss the furtive exchange of glances what do you mean by not exactly she inquired dubiously harry developed a sudden fascination with his trainers rinna eyes narrowed may i see this letter she said with disconcerting calm harry fidgeted nervously you still have the letter dontyou she asked well i not sure where it is he hedged rinna sighed and closed her eyes and began rubbing her temples with her fingertips her tone held more than a hint of impatience do you suppose you could find it for me harry looked at his friends again they stared at him wide eyed no help whatsoever uh i guess so i ll go try to find it harry replied reluctantly he turned and slowly went up the stairs rinna huffed in exasperation she d seen flobberworms move faster than he did ginny hermione and ron deciding they might be safer if they followed harry carefully avoided rinna gaze and slunk off after their friend molly had returned and caught the end of the exchange she looked at rinna curiously but didntsay anything she simply set rinna things down and watched as rinna nervously paced obviously on tenterhooks harry seemed to take a long time finally he returned ron hermione and ginny behind him rinna gestured impatiently to him hand outstretched and fingers wriggling and he slowly walked to her to grudgingly hand her the letter harry knew the letter was less than flattering he wished he had lied and told her he didnthave it anymore as she opened the letter rinna felt a pang at seeing the familiar handwriting after so long she began to read and let out a snort at the first line she continued to read her lips moving ever so slightly when she suddenly stopped what he had doubts about where my loyalties lie she muttered harry looked at her nervously the pale skin of her face was beginning to turn red and her mouth was pressed into a thin hard line he saw the movement of her eyes as she scanned the next line what i wish i could tell you that you can trust her he doesntthink i trustworthy her indignation was mounting and her ears were now flushing pink harry took a cautious step backwards be careful who the hell does he rinna felt like a spring being stretched too far harry jumped when rinna eyes snapped from the letter to his face how long have you had this letter she barked uh not long i got it a couple of days ago she had already returned to reading the rest of the contents of the letter and began to mutter more angrily remus didntsay anything about this i need to talk to remus she heard a roaring in her ears as her anger began to mount the last little rational part of her mind really wished she had not come to the burrow today as she was incapable of controlling the fury that suddenly consumed her at reading sirius hurtful assessment of her she crumpled the letter in her hand and swore everyone flinched she threw the letter down in her temper and strode swiftly into the living room to stand at the fireplace molly quickly followed her rinna dear calm down i sure there is a good explanation hermione leaned over to harry and murmured well here proof that the weasleys donthold exclusive rights to that red headed temper harry cast her a flabbergasted look his godmother looked like she was going to burst a blood vessel and hermione was joking couldntshe see that this was all his fault stupid wretched letter writing it had been one of his most idiotic blunders ever he moved toward the living room and the others followed the four teens crowded through the living room door right as rinna pulled out her wand and pointed it at the fireplace incendio she bit out flinging some floo powder in she crouched down and thrust her face in the fire rinna head appeared in the fireplace at tonks flat dorrie dorrie is remus still there i need to talk to him rinna voice was shrill remus was so startled that he immediately stood up and strode to the fireplace what is it rin his voice died as he took in the expression on her face uh oh big trouble he hadntseen her this livid in quite some time remus she snapped eyes flashing with angry fire or was it just the flames please just let it be the flames remus remembered the few times rinna had been in a snit like this one and he d been grateful he had never been on the receiving end of it it would seem his luck had run out today not that that wouldntbe in keeping with the theme of the last two days anyway remus his eyes snapped back to hers no it definitely wasntthe light from the fireplace damn his voice was calm belying the very unsettled feeling that was descending on him at the moment i right here rinna he could see the weasley living room behind her and he noticed harry there looking very upset and guilty were you aware that harry wrote a letter to sirius she demanded remus watched as harry winced and began slinking his way toward the living room door with ron and hermione in tow not until yesterday afternoon when harry and sirius told me he answered still calmly and that sirius wrote him back uh no i wasntaware of that he replied wondering where this was going he turned to look at sirius who was out of the line of sight of the fireplace and mouthed what the bloody hell did you write to rile her up like that sirius merely shrugged he was enjoying the scene so far he remembered the few times rinna had been in a snit like this one most of them had been directed at him those had always ended very satisfactorily with some kind of snogging heavy groping or make up sex he felt a small flame of hope kindle in his chest he wrote oh by all the bloody moons of jupiter i cantbelieve what he wrote remus she shrilled he bloody wrote i had my doubts about where her loyalties lie he questioned my effing loyalty remus she was in full blown tirade mode now and there was no stopping her remus just winced and braced for the blast from the storm what the hell does he mean by questioning my loyalty since when did sirius ever question my loyalty she cried now remus noted that molly was rounding the kids up most likely to get them away from all the swearing well remus said very carefully when you broke your engagement with him he looked very uncomfortable rinna looked at him with deceptive calm when she spoke again her voice was soft and dangerous i thought you said sirius thought you and i were having an affair she ignored the surprised gasps behind her in fact for all she was aware the burrow no longer existed remus glanced at sirius who had an amused expression this made remus very disgruntled well that was one of the theories he had come up with yes he said defensively rinna glared at him you failed to mention that he d come up with a nice turning to the dark side hypothesis as well she said icily sirius chuckled i thought you said she had changed moony remus turned and glared at him shut it you you are not helping what did you say came rinna sharp voice uh look rinna he began how could he have thought that that me me of all people would join voldemort was he barmy she said furiously she a right spitfire just like old times sirius commented tell me moony does she look as sexy as she used to all fired up like that remus cocked his head around and fixed sirius with a withering scowl i told you to shut it i beg your pardon rinna said indignantly completely offended no no not you he said turning back to the fireplace what she shrieked is he there the look on remus face must have given him away because she began to climb through the fireplace that it i coming over there without so much as a by your leave to the weasleys or harry she flooed into tonks flat what no rinna wait remus began frantically but it was too late she was there brushing soot off her shoulders and searching the room for one sirius black her thunderstorm eyes locked onto his as he stood to face her how could you she challenged how could you ever think i would go to that bastard side she advanced on him her fury blistering the air remus was quite convinced that she had crossed over the demarcation of rationality and he got his wand ready to disarm the situation he was surprised when she stopped in front of sirius instead of doing him bodily harm and stood with her hands on her hips sparks of anger almost visibly snapping off of her well she inquired wrathfully sirius crossed his arms over his chest and studied her impassively there was no trace of mischief on his face now well he drawled sardonically may i point out that you thought i was a mass murderer and that i had gone over to his side oh the air rushed out of her lungs as the anger flowed out of her body and she visibly wilted sirius hand reached out to catch her elbow as she swayed and he solicitously walked her to the nearest armchair oh she said again in a quiet shamed voice as she sat down she leaned back and closed her eyes a pained look on her face remus sprang into action bringing a bottle and a glass from the cabinet over to rinna here he poured it and handed her the glass she eyed it warily it your favorite muggle stuff he added showing her the bottle she noted the familiar black label then glared up at him i beg your pardon but arentyou the one who seems to think i have a drinking problem she asked sarcastically remus gave her a measuring look in this case i here to monitor your intake right and we both know how that turned out the last time dontwe she pointed out scathingly don t he began nervously flicking his gaze to sirius who had sat down and was watching the exchange with much interest i won t i not a complete idiot i ll have you know she interrupted acerbically she snorted although i will admit you could argue the credibility of my last statement based on my behavior today she contemplated the glass in her hand swirling the liquid a few times and considered handing it back to remus ah bugger it she knocked it back remus looked at her coolly i willing to settle for half wit and call it even he deadpanned rinna mouth hung open in indignant shock for a few seconds before she huffed out a laugh she hurled a small decorative pillow she seized from the armchair smirking and cackling in triumph as it connected soundly with remus midsection sirius felt a pang of jealousy at being excluded from the easy albeit tense at the moment camaraderie between the two of them he was impressed with the skill remus used to disarm the clearly hacked off rinna he probably had lots of practice he surmised his eyes wandered back to rinna as remus sat on the couch making a deliberate show of using the pillow rinna had thrown as a headrest sirius was startled to find green eyes studying him carefully you look like you could use a drink too she observed well he stated mildly it been a while she reached toward remus flexing her fingers to indicate he should hand over the bottle she poured more into the glass she held and got up to walk it over to sirius rinna handed him the glass and turned but sirius quickly took her hand in his she turned back to him in surprise he caught her gaze with his eyes i sorry he said quietly somehow she knew he was talking about his outburst in the weasley garden yesterday he saw a change flicker in her emerald eyes as they softened she took in his bedraggled appearance his hollow cheeks and the dark circles under his eyes that one mere night of sleep could not yet erase even though he d cleaned himself up he still looked like he had been through hell and he has i sorry too was her soft reply somehow he knew she was talking about more than her tantrum earlier he nodded she pulled her hand from his and returned to her chair to watch him sip the whiskey he grimaced and gave a little shudder what is this stuff american whiskey muggle liquor she chuckled ruefully i ve picked up a few bad habits over the years remus snorted and she turned to glare at him as i sure remus can tell you remus snorted again really rinna thirteen years worth of bad habits it could take days to cover she searched for another pillow but at the sound of sirius chuckle she whipped her head around to include him in her glare he tipped the glass of whiskey at her in a cheeky salute and tossed it back when he put the glass down he found rinna looking at him gravely why did you come back sirius you dontknow he said gently her eyes dropped to the floor i came back because of you a n i really really really love to hear from my readers hint hint please wontyou take a minute or two and leave me a review a little note about chinese names according to my research the chinese use their family name first then their given name if a western name is given to a child or an adult adopts a western name he or she will follow the western convention of listing that name first hence rinna stepfather name at the beginning of the chapter follows this sequence western name family name given name rinna mother name follows the sequence we are most familiar with also the diminutive or familiar form of the chinese given name has ah in front of it i just found that interesting and i hope you did too now if i have really gotten this all wrong will someone please let me know 13 a new definition of family chapter 12 second chances disclaimer sadly i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe any characters places situations or whatnot that you dontfind in her fabulous books well they are mine i wish i owned sirius and remus cause then i would take them and uh glances at all the readers looking at me in deep concern hmmm scratch that harry sat out on the back porch morosely staring at nothing in particular he heard the back door open then close footsteps moved toward him squeaking the floorboards as they came he had to smile in spite of his mood as he realized who had joined him how is ron doing he asked hermione hermione sat down in the wicker love seat next to him and sighed after the upsetting encounter with rinna ron and hermione had dragged a very despondent harry to the kitchen to talk ron had spied a bowl of sweets on the table and had tried to convince harry that a few candies would help him feel better harry who at that point felt almost nauseous had declined that of course did not stop ron from partaking in the tempting treats hermione was trying to be kind and remember that ron had been just as upset for harry sake but really how could he have forgotten the unwritten rule of the weasley household never eat anything that might have been left out by fred and george the latest weasley twin invention the ton tongue toffee had been a brilliant success well i think mrs weasley has finally hit on a shrinking charm that will work his tongue is only hanging down to his belly button now poor ron harry said trying not to smile at the image her words brought to his mind what was he thinking eating those sweets well to be fair he was very concerned that you were so upset that must have distracted him hermione watched as harry heaved a big sigh knowing him he was now thinking that this too was all his fault she ransacked her mind quickly for something to divert him you should have heard mrs weasley muttering all kinds of threats about what would happen to fred and george when they got home i sure she was doing it to make ron feel better so he d calm down well it looks like i ll be part of another conspiracy to get back at the twins harry said ruefully thanks for checking up on him for me hermione looked at him knowingly you mean thanks for giving you time to mope out here on your own when harry opened his mouth to deny it she interrupted come on harry you are no more to blame for this happening than you are for rinna blow out about sirius at the look on his face she continued i know i know you wrote that letter i sick of hearing about that miserable letter harry looked at her sourly what are you doing out here hermione he asked pointedly i trying to help you feel better well you re doing a bang up job of it so far he retorted sarcastically you just dontunderstand hermione took a deep breath and huffed her bangs off her forehead she hadntcome out here to have a row with harry she leaned back and said all right help me understand harry was taken off guard what help me understand you know talk to me tell me what you are feeling t tell you my feelings harry looked completely alarmed as if hermione had asked him to tickle a scorpion or something yes she said barely hanging on to her patience that what people do when they communicate with each other when did hermione get to be all touchy feely all let talk this out all so so so girly harry glanced at hermione sitting next to him her face full of concern and her gorgeous brown eyes so troubled at his distress actually to be truthful over the last week he d begun to appreciate the more girly aspects of hermione she d grown a little taller and she d gotten a bit curvy and soft looking and her lips always seemed an inviting shade of pink and her eyes warm like melted chocolate and wouldntit be nice to fall into warm melty chocolaty sweetness harry hermione voice snapped him out of his reverie and he hoped desperately that he d not said any of that out loud sorry he muttered fine if your eyes are going to glaze over like that every time i ask you to talk to me she began irritably no no he said mind racing i uh was just trying to think of what to tell you first really she asked skeptically harry sighed he was no good at this actually no i was just thinking about how pretty your eyes were harry heard hermione surprised intake of breath and froze damn i said that out loud didnti said eyes were gaping at him now a bit wide and wild you were what she asked weakly well he d put his foot into it he might as well throw himself in completely you have pretty eyes and i like it when you look at me all concerned like that harry her voice was faint how did we get from talking about your feelings to talking about my eyes i dunno but it sure is helping me feel better he grinned at her not knowing how it seemed to make her heart stop for a moment isntthat what you wanted to accomplish yes i mean no uh i dontknow she said confusedly desperately trying to gather her scattered wits harry grin grew wider the sight of a completely flustered hermione was a rare one he pressed the advantage and boldly took her hand lacing his fingers between hers and placing them on his thigh well it working he said with satisfaction as startled as hermione was she found she liked the feeling of his warm hand in hers and she made no move to change the situation and so they sat fingers intertwined shoulders touching hearts beating madly the muffled sound of mrs weasley shouting various shrinking charms drifting down from the upper level windows eventually harry spoke i am feeling badly that rinna read all those rather uncomplimentary things sirius wrote and that they had another row because of it at least i assuming they had a row she flooed through because he was there and she was mad as a hornet hermione squeezed his hand to encourage him to continue and i rather worried for sirius because of it harry didntsee hermione roll her eyes she should learn to control her temper better she opined harry shot her a look he was beginning to think that hermione didntlike his godmother very much she noticed his glance and the baffled expression besides she continued sweetly professor lupin was there he d have made sure she didnthex sirius too badly harry glance turned to a look of exasperation thanks i thought you were trying to make me feel better hermione gave a mental sigh trying to follow harry moods was like riding a roller coaster in the dark you never knew which way they would turn attempting to salvage the romantic moment they d just had she shifted in the seat and turned her body to face him more maybe you should look into my eyes again she suggested harry thought the proposition a brilliant one sirius black stared moodily into the fire a scowl on his face he was unhappily reviewing the events of the afternoon things had not gone according to plan he snorted not that you had a plan to begin with you idiot you had no idea you would see her again so soon he d been convinced when rinna had emerged from the fireplace eyes flashing and hands on her hips in fury that remus had been wrong this was the girl he remembered she hadntchanged at all of course a phrase like i came back because of you should have melted the girl he remembered into a puddle of goo she had loved romantic talk like that sirius scowl deepened as he remembered what this new rinna reaction had been rinna shot up out of the chair and began pacing restlessly around the room no sirius do not say that to me she said with quiet intensity you shouldnthave come back here you are the most wanted wizard in england if they catch you they will have the dementors perform the kiss she shuddered if that happened and the reason you were here was because of me it would break me i would not be able to bear it the last part came out a whisper as her face sunk into her hands when she composed herself she looked up into sirius stunned face no she whispered no this time louder i will not accept responsibility for your foolish decision you are not going to lay that on me sirius looked at her incredulously rinna what did you think i would do once i learned you were here stay away she returned to her agitated pacing yes i expected you to want to stay as far away from me as possible i expected that you would never want to see me again i expected you to hate me for what i did i did hate you he said quietly bringing her to an abrupt halt at least part of me did the rest of me spent the last thirteen years thinking about you about what could have been i cantjust let go of that she looked at him sadly sirius i have spent the last thirteen years trying to get over you i ve tried to stop thinking about you she ran her hands through her hair tugging at it fretfully you cantjust ask me to suddenly change the way i think why not he countered you changed the way you thought about me once before back at school you took a chance on us then her feet began moving again not so much pacing as just little aimless movements as she wrung her hands nervously you dontknow what you are asking of me her words were anxious and laced with trepidation she looked for all the world like a rabbit trying to determine if it should freeze or bolt tell me he pleaded standing up and reaching for her but he dropped his arm when she brought her wringing hands up to cross at her breastbone just under her chin as if warding her heart you are asking me to feel things again she spoke apprehensively to feel things for you i can t it will hurt too much she turned away and strode toward the fireplace it occurred to sirius that she was once again running away and he moved to intercept her taking her arm and spinning her around to face him rinna please her eyes were desolate sirius let me go i cantdo this not right now if you open the floodgates i will be swept away and drowned he heard her voice quail please sirius if you even care for me a little you will let me go he immediately released her arm but his eyes did not release her gaze he probed deeply into her eyes so familiar and green and so haunted she was hurting frightened damaged she stared at him for a moment startled and discomfited before she gave a choking sob and turned for the fireplace in a flash of green flame she was gone sirius was forced to acknowledge that it was na ve to think that so much time could go by and not have changed her hell he had certainly changed he had never been so introspective back then if he had spent even two minutes in contemplation he would have considered himself on the level of socrates but now after an eternity in azkaban where he had nothing to do but think suddenly he was struck by something he d noticed in the recent encounter with rinna one thing that had not changed the repartee between rinna and remus sirius felt comfort in finding something familiar and yet simultaneously he felt a vague disquiet as he recalled their interaction their banter had been typical of their exchanges back at school witty sharp jibing clever acerbic and flirtatious his mind whispered harshly sirius closed his eyes and perceived the flickering of the flames through his eyelids he struggled to think rationally suppressing the ugly monster of jealously that was trying to rear its menacing head remus had told him there was no other man in rinna life now surely if there had been something going on between them remus wouldnthave played it off as nothing sirius head snapped up as he heard remus voice from the couch neither of them had changed positions since rinna had left how are you holding up padfoot remus sounded full of concern you were right moony she has changed he turned around and stalked back to the chair you must know her pretty well he added pointedly an edge to his voice remus heart began to pound as he felt the anxiety of guilt press down on him he suspects something but the rational part of his mind admonished what are you feeling guilty for your relationship with rinna has simply been a deep friendship and a small number of snogging sessions the last few weeks his pulse slowed a bit with this realization until a traitorous thought slipped in and an unrequited infatuation for the last twenty some odd years he tamped that last thought down viciously there was no point in encouraging that line of thinking anymore even if he knew that squelching such quisling feelings would never negate the fascination he felt for rinna of course i know her well sirius all we had left was each other her love and friendship has meant more to me than anything she was my link to the past and she gave me a reason to look forward i probably know her better than anyone else except maybe tonks although i think i know her better because of all our years of friendship remus put a slight emphasis on the last word sirius frowned just because he recognized the truth to what remus said didntmean he had to like it in the past no matter how much remus and rinna had carried on sirius had known that she would eventually turn to him and flirt with him outrageously or kiss him or even better after they d left school go home with him to the tiny bedroom in the flat he had shared with james perhaps that was why the way she had interacted with remus had never incited him to jealousy before remus continued i still catch glimpses of the girl we used to know it not that she has changed completely but i think our rinna has become overburdened with guilt she blamed herself for your apparent defection to the dark lord and a mere couple of months of knowing the truth cantyet negate what she told herself for so many years and of course now she feels guilty for ever thinking you could have done what you are accused of something clicked into place in sirius brain she doesntexpect that i would forgive her for breaking our engagement for shattering my heart for doubting my loyalty if he was honest with himself part of him did not want to forgive her his anger with her even hatred had been such a part of him and a key to his survival and yet deep in his heart he knew he wanted a second chance with her and he wanted to forgive and forget the pain and regrets no she doesn t remus confirmed sirius felt almost panicked and he sprung from the chair in agitation i need to show her she wrong i need to he turned to remus desperation on his face i need her remus sat in silent contemplation for a few moments her heart was never yours he reminded himself he got up and walked over to sirius clapping his hand on sirius shoulder she still loves you padfoot i know it you heard what she said she tried to stop thinking about you but she couldn t in all these years she has not gotten over you there was a flicker of hope in sirius troubled eyes why are you telling me this remus remus sighed and sirius was surprised to see a pained expression cross his face sirius literally overnight i lost everyone i loved rinna was the only one i got back until now i love you i love her i want to see you both happy it was the truth and remus was almost able to convince himself that he didntfeel the little spasm of pain grip his heart when he said it sirius was moved by what his oldest friend had said remus had always known how to soothe even his most tumultuous moods especially back at school when the fledgling relationship between him and rinna had caused him much anxiety and insecurity he gripped remus forearm and asked earnestly you dontthink it too late that we have both changed too much for it to work it funny thought remus that despite all we have been through the dynamic between the three of us has stayed the same some things will never change sirius no matter how much time has passed sitting alone in the darkened living room of her flat that had been recently vacated by a werewolf and an outlaw nymphadora tonks was feeling a bit meddlesome it wasntoften that she felt the need to interfere in her friends lives but when her two dear friends and her favorite cousin were involved well that was a different matter entirely remus and sirius had related what had happened that afternoon a short while before tonks had arrived home from work with dinner in hand yesterday tonks had felt sympathy for rinna after all the poor thing had been taken by surprise at sirius arrival at the weasleys but today today tonks was feeling a bit frustrated with her former flatmate quite a bit frustrated in fact and more than a bit concerned apparently rinna had provoked a confrontation with sirius had heard the man declare that she was the reason he had returned to england thus answering the forgiveness question in tonks opinion and then ran like hell this was not like her at all and tonks had a feeling she knew why so she was going to meddle why is it that matters of the heart are so messy a bubble gum pink haired head poked into rinna fireplace it was getting late but she knew rinna wouldnthave left for work yet dunnie you there rinna stepped into the living room oh merlin your cousin has sent you here to torment me for being such a jackass hasnthe tonks climbed into the room pointedly ignoring rinna outburst you know it very convenient having you connected to the floo network now why didntyou do this sooner she flicked some soot off her jeans and my cousin is no longer at my flat what he gone tonks walked into the kitchen rinna at her heels and reached for the teakettle she continued conversationally sirius and remus told me of your rather abrupt visit to my flat today i sure i got the abridged version but i heard enough to gather what had happened rinna groaned and put her face in her hands and yes you were a bit of a jackass i ve never known you to lose your cool like that i haventbeen myself lately rinna said weakly tonks looked at her with a mixture of pity and exasperation that because you are not being honest with yourself she pulled some teabags from the cupboard accidentally knocking down a tin of crackers and you ve been keeping things from me haventyou rinna was struck by how much tonks reminded her of molly weasley at the moment keeping things she asked lamely as she tucked the crackers she had deftly caught back up on the cupboard shelf tonks set the teapot on the table i came home with chinese take away which the two of them wolfed down she looked slyly at rinna who had sat at the table and was looking rather on edge or should i say they ate doggedly rinna was startled what sirius used his dog form to enter and leave my flat why didntyou tell me he was an animagus it not supposed to be common knowledge dorrie that why i kept it from y actually tonks interrupted i was referring to your relationship with remus she poured the hot water carefully while rinna paled and gaped at her how how did you how did how did i know about that honestly doesntanyone remember that i am a fully trained auror skilled in piecing together evidence tonks exclaimed huffily i ve observed the two of you over the years how you behave around each other and i skillfully extracted a confession from your professor last night she ended with satisfaction a flush of anger began to creep up rinna neck but tonks was undeterred is that what is keeping you running away from sirius this fling you are having with remus it is not a fling rinna said hotly we just kissed a few times and it could probably be something more but sirius came crashing back into the picture and now i dontknow what to feel bollocks tonks fired back sharply you know how you feel you just refuse to be honest with yourself because if you admit that you are still in love with sirius it means you will have to start processing through stuff that you have put off dealing with all these years rinna looked at her friend with wide eyes completely staggered come on rinna this is the love of your life we are talking about the man you were going to marry the man you were willing to give up everything for in order to save him the man who came back here to see you again despite how dangerous it is for him the man who wants a second chance with you how do you know that what he wants rinna whispered tonks threw up her hands in exasperation hello auror here remember i have taken what sirius has said to me and remus what he said to you the past two days combined it with what you ve told me about your past and voila deductive reasoning you should try it sometime even though she had spent several hours in heated debate between her heart and her brain over these very same things it was hearing tonks say everything out loud that finally brought her heart and mind into agreement rinna closed her eyes a single tear making its track down her cheek you re right dorrie i ve never stopped loving him she felt tonks grab her hand and squeeze it and looked at her friend but what about remus i care about him too i dontwant to hurt him oh dunnie remus will be fine he already knows you still love sirius you know at rinna surprised look she added he told me she paused i think you two have always had a little crush on each other haventyou all through school and even now rinna groaned and leaned forward to smack her forehead on the table canti have both of them she asked in a small voice tonks let out a snort of laughter well that would make you a greedy little bint now wouldntit or are you into some weird kinky stuff i dontknow about rinna lifted her head slightly and looked up at tonks please i messed up enough as it is dontyou think what i think is you need to figure out what you want that way the next time you see sirius black you are prepared tonks poured some tea and pushed the cup toward rinna accidentally with a little too much force rinna nimbly caught the cup just as it slid off the edge of the table and without missing a beat she poured the contents that had sloshed out into the saucer back into the cup and sipped it nice save tonks noted thanks i ve had a bit of practice rinna replied with a smirk tonks made a face at her rinna held her cup up in a salute to her friend before sipping again but dorrie didntyou say sirius left where did he go tonks shrugged i dontknow he told me that you mentioned his name as you flooed the flat she paused as rinna brought her palm to her forehead and he didntwant to put me in a compromising position personally i think he overreacting a bit but i suppose being a little paranoid is what kept him from being caught so far rinna nodded is remus still at your flat then she was surprised at the twinge of jealousy she felt licking at her heart oh please remus lupin is too much of a gentleman to ruin the reputation of an unmarried woman by spending the night at her flat but tonks couldntresist the dig unless of course he is completely squiffy then he d be willing to spend the night in her bed she gave rinna a sly look stupid nosy aurors never happy till you have every sordid detail i hate you did you know rinna glared at her no you don t dunnie tonks countered cheerfully as she stood up to take the teakettle back to the stove you love me and you dontknow what you d do with out me rinna stood up as well too bloody right the two women embraced merlin dorrie i glad i have such a pain in the arse friend like you to keep me grounded tonks gave her one last squeeze and pulled away are you going to be all right now rinna cocked her head in thought i not sure but i haventended up in the madhouse yet so that a good sign dontyou think tonks snorted and glanced at the clock and if we want to keep you out of the poorhouse you should scamper off to work i think damn rinna gave her a quick continental kiss i ve got to fly dorrie thanks for the tea and for the figurative smacking upside the head that what i here for luv tonks turned and made her way to the living room rinna head jerked up at the sound of something breaking into tiny pieces i can fix that she heard tonks call from the living room rinna looked down and shook her head with a sigh as she heard a mumbled reparo followed by the whoosh of the fireplace the sound of rapping at the window assaulted rinna ears and with a moan she dragged herself from the depths of sleep and opened one eye the clock told her it was 11 00 am the curtains were closed but the sound was unmistakable someone had sent her an owl too tired to even grumble she stumbled to release the window latch the owl flew in and settled on the dresser offering its letter to her she mumbled to the owl to wait for her reply my dear arinna i was very pleased to receive your letter and your curriculum vitae while i remember your excellence at mixing drinks and that still was the best martini i have had by far i would agree that your myriad of talents could be put to better use in other venues i believe i have a proposal that you will find most interesting i would like to meet with you five days hence at your home if that is convenient sincerely albus dumbledore ps you wouldnthappen to have any more of that irish beer now would you rinna was wide awake now a proposal her heart raced in anticipation what could he have in mind she quickly dashed off a reply and sent the owl on its way then she reread the letter and sighed she would have to procure some more guinness she sat in the armchair and explored all the possibilities of what dumbledore could have in mind turning his words over and over in her head at some point she must have drifted off back to sleep because she found herself waking to another rapping at her window annoyed by the crick in her neck she opened the window yet again and was perplexed to see a different owl it flew in and also landed on her dresser she was startled to see that it had a rose in its mouth and she took the rose with trembling fingers it was a fire and ice rose its soft petals white on the outside and deep crimson on the inside she automatically brought it to her nose as she became lost in a memory the four marauders sat down at the library table where rinna was working on her ancient runes assignment she was expecting a group of third years she d been tutoring so she was surprised to see them when she looked up need some help with your schoolwork gentlemen she grinned saucily at them james smiled easily at her running his fingers through his hair and pouring on the charm no dunlevy blokes as brilliant as us dontneed to trifle with schoolwork rinna snorted and rolled her eyes at them sirius leaned forward conspiratorially and spoke in a low voice we just want to thank you for getting us out of that tight spot the other night you lads were cutting it awfully close dontyou think she frowned at them eyeing remus what if you hadntmade it to the shack in time well the point is we did thanks to you sirius replied and we were wondering added james with a sly look at sirius hypothetically of course if someone wanted to get you something nice say flowers or candy you know as a thank you gift well what should he get you rinna leaned back in her chair shifting her gaze from one to the other they all managed to radiate a look of innocence her eyes narrowed why would i reveal that kind of information to you four of all people it is strictly for research purposes sirius assured her and at her skeptical expression he added ingenuously you dontthink we d try to use this knowledge against you do you dunlevy rinna gave another rather unladylike snort i cantimagine why i would ever think that black she retorted sarcastically but grinned at him cheekily to take the sting out of her jibe besides you dontneed to give me a gift for helping you out you know i did it because it was the decent thing to do she smiled at remus james smacked his hand lightly on the table pay attention dunlevy i said it was a hypothetical situation come on rinna you know we will wheedle the information from you eventually you might as well give it up now cajoled remus or we could wait here and obstruct the flow of higher learning he cocked his head toward the three third year ravenclaws who had arrived for their tutoring session she arched an eyebrow at remus you are all insufferable gits i just want that stated for the record duly noted quipped james his eyes sparkling playfully now are you going to comply with our simple request she rolled her eyes again since when has anything to do with you marauders ever been simple she paused to sigh in a long suffering manner all right then hypothetically my favorite candy is dark chocolate and my favorite flower is the fire and ice rose at their puzzled expressions she added you know the ones that are white on the outside but red on the inside the boys stood up having accomplished their mission and all flashed rinna what she had labeled the trademark marauder smile before turning to leave wait rinna called before they d gone far four pairs of eyes regarded her with surprise rinna eyed james a small smirk on her face here some more information for your so called research my friend lily likes pink roses and milk chocolate with almonds james face split into a huge grin as he beamed at her like she had just fluttered down from heaven as rinna eyes followed them out of the library sirius tossed a glance back at her she raised her eyebrows inquiringly he winked and his lips quirked his best lothario smile at her before he sauntered off after his mates if she was blushing furiously the third year students waiting patiently for her attention made no comment of it rinna tapped the rose against her lips and smiled as she recalled that the morning after the next hogsmeade weekend she had received by owl post two things one had been a half kilogram tin of honeydukes finest dark chocolates with a small card that read hypothetically from your marauders thanks for saving our arses and the other had been a single fire and ice rose carried in the owl beak no note had accompanied it but a certain blue eyed marauder had watched very intently as she had brought it to her nose rinna continued to smile as a funny feeling that had nothing to do with the need for breakfast tickled at her stomach she inhaled the scent of the rose again and a trickle of hope began to wash over her maybe you should rethink your belief that second chances are a myth rinna girl her

curled up on the couch brooding over the picture album again molly sighed she d thought she was the last one to bed all right harry couldntyou sleep she went to sit next to him harry shook his head i sorry for disturbing you oh you re hardly doing that molly smiled now setting off confetti bombs in the hallway or filching cookies from the kitchen or playing that game you and hermione taught everyone today with the brooms here in the living room in your stocking feet broom hockey harry supplied helpfully an apologetic look on his face ah yes broom hockey playing broom hockey and breaking the picture glass in the portrait of otto percival weasley now those are things that disturb me not quietly laying about and moping molly informed him i not harry began in protest but suddenly didnthave the heart to continue molly looked at him kindly do you want to talk about it luv for years harry had dreamed of having a motherly person in his life who would say things to him just like that in just that same tone of voice who just as he sensed mrs weasley was willing to do would take him in her protective loving arms and comfort him he would have been embarrassed to admit it to anyone even this kind woman who was that mother figure to him and there was the rub even though he appreciated the maternal concern and kindness that mrs weasley had unconditionally given him he found himself inexplicably wishing that it was the red headed woman in the pictures on his lap that was offering it to him which made absolutely no sense whatsoever since the primary feeling he had toward rinna lately was one of being rather hacked off at her harry shrugged not really he said molly heaved a sigh all right but if you change your mind she gently ruffled his hair as she stood up from the couch thanks he said sincerely not minding the touch very much at all the next afternoon found harry sitting his back against the big tree with the photo album once again on his lap that morning after finding him asleep on the couch with it ginny had told him outright that he was getting unnervingly attached to it hermione and ron didntsay it out loud but he suspected they thought along the same lines as ginny but it really was helping him feel closer to his mum and dad even if more often than not he found himself drifting into the section of pictures that were almost exclusively of rinna and sirius wishing that things were different a movement in the woods beyond the yard caught his eye a dark shape darting among the bushes harry closed the scrapbook with a snap his heart thudding suddenly in his chest and he moved to the side gate he stepped into the woods and called softly snuffles he was answered by a low yip and a shaggy black head came into view from under a bush tongue lolling in a doggy grin harry stepped around the bush and smiled as snuffles pounced forward onto his front paws in a playful gesture before turning and romping deeper into the woods when harry did not follow quickly enough the large black dog repeated the action with a sharp yap and spun around again looking over his shoulder to see if harry was moving all right harry laughed i coming but we cantgo too far the dog stopped when they were out of eyesight but not earshot of the house and sat with his tail thumping happily as he waited for harry to catch up harry approached him wondering how he could have ever found this huge black pooch menacing or intimidating he had to suppress the urge to grab up a stick and throw it with a fetch boy the next instant snuffles had changed into sirius and harry found himself in an embrace being thumped heartily on his back harry stepped back and grinned sirius you look a lot better he noted well i ve had a few meals and some decent rest it makes a big difference the two of them found an old log to sit on harry looked him up and down are you okay absolutely sirius answered with a puzzled look why wouldnti be oh well it just that harry paused a little embarrassed the other day rinna sounded like she was ready to hex you into oblivion ah that sirius looked thoughtful i didntrealize you were there for that he sighed well you ve certainly had the chance to see the two of us at our best haventyou he asked dryly harry shrugged no there was no hexing involved i happy to say what is her problem anyway harry asked petulantly sirius studied harry for a moment weighing what the appropriate answer should be he came up with it complicated harry that exactly what she said about you was his disgruntled reply sirius chuckled ruefully that pretty much accurately sums us up i think complicated then why were you ever together harry wondered sirius pensively considered harry question there is no logical explanation i can give you he said at last there were a lot of factors that should have kept us from ever getting together not the least of which was that when we met we didntlike each other much at all harry thought about what rinna had told him about moving up into the next year potions class and pictured what sirius reaction to her might have been but sirius continued in spite of our differences we slowly discovered we were more alike than we realized he saw the question in harry eyes for one thing we both came from old wizarding families purebloods harry said flatly sirius gave him an inscrutable look yes purebloods although the dunlevy name wasntnearly so well known as mine still she understood the pressure there is to live up to expectations he sighed we both had abusive fathers harry head jerked up at that actually her father was a monster sirius mouth had formed a thin hard line fortunately her mother had left him and married a decent sort of man my parents disowned me because i was a disappointment to them i didntembrace the values of the ancient and most noble house of black sirius ran his hand through his hair i had my friends and they loved me and supported me but she was the only one who really understood the pain i was feeling he said softly as he glanced up at harry that was her gift empathy mixed with compassion she seemed to instinctively be able to pick out the students who were hurting or struggling and she helped them it didntmatter what house they were from or what their bloodlines were that what she became known for now that was the kind of person harry could see his mum having as a friend not the heart breaking high tempered woman he was angry with so why did she change he asked change sirius was startled harry really didntknow her so how could he be that perceptive what do you mean change of course she changed sirius harry countered with some heat she wasntbeing compassionate when she broke your heart was she or when she abandoned me to the dursleys his green eyes snapped with hurt and anger sirius stared at his godson with dawning realization harry was a lost soul as well deeply damaged just like him just like rinna he didntknow his godson well but he should have recognized should have understood he reached out and put a hand on harry shoulder harry flinched but then leaned into the touch sirius was filled with sudden clarifying rage not at rinna but at the source of all this hurt and pain voldemort the bastard who had taken so much from him so much from rinna and so much from harry sirius let his heart fill with hatred a hatred so intense that it burned away any remaining anger and resentment he felt toward rinna and then he let the purifying fire die out till there was only an ember flickering as a reminder of what he was fighting for he took a deep breath and felt somehow lighter and much more optimistic than he had since he first read harry note about rinna sirius took a deep breath and said in a gentle voice dontbe too hard on your godmother harry after all the two of you have many things in common right said harry a hint of bitterness in his voice like what well she loves to fly you love to fly you are both mad about quidditch harry nodded at this remembering the night on her broom and the game at his party he d recognized they had shared that and he had liked the feeling of being a little closer to his godmother that knowledge had brought what sirius quietly said next nearly knocked harry off his seat in surprise her parents that is her mother and step father were murdered just like yours harry felt his heart stop for a moment murdered he whispered she understands what it is like to be violently orphaned harry she out of anybody can appreciate what you have been through harry contemplated this for a while a thousand questions warring inside him before he finally stored this new information away for further dissection later he finally looked at sirius gazed into his haunted eyes and asked gravely do you still love her never letting his gaze waver from harry intense green eyes he answered i believe i do how do you know harry voice held no rancor only curiosity well that simple simple harry demanded i thought you said it was complicated sirius huffed slightly exasperated well it is simple and complicated he rolled his eyes at harry frown of confusion i dontknow how to explain it i just know that we were meant to be together that all okay said harry as if that had made perfect sense sirius stared at him if it had sirius wished harry would explain it to him at sirius answer harry had felt a little jolt of hope in his heart and he immediately thought of his favorite picture of sirius and rinna from the album that he d left by the tree must remember to retrieve that it was the one of the two of them on sirius motorcycle rinna sat snuggled up against sirius back with her arms wrapped around him looking mischievous as she whispered something into his ear and sirius turned back with a wicked grin before jumping off the motorcycle pulling her to him and kissing her full on the mouth hermione and ginny had sighed at that one harry liked it because of the happy smiles on their faces after they had kissed so what are you going to do about it harry asked what taken aback sirius studied his godson keenly was there a hint of impudence in that smirk of his how he looked so much like james do about what rinna harry explained like he was talking to a five year old we are talking about rinna i ve already agreed to stop being so hard on her actually you didn t sirius pointed out harry rolled his eyes okay i now agree to stop being so hard on her so what are you going to do about her sirius didntknow how remus had done it he really didn t handling the quixotic changes of mood of teenagers merlin sirius thought i would never have been able to be a teacher for one thing he felt himself reverting to his arrogant pugnacious teenaged self at the challenge in harry tone that sounded uncannily like james i ll have you know that i already have a plan and it is going quite well thank you very much suddenly sirius was struck by inspiration there had been a particular rosebush in molly garden that rinna had loved the color of i say harry maybe you could help me out with something fortunately later that evening no one noticed that one of molly bushes had been plundered or that hedwig was missing albus dumbledore climbed the two short steps to the stoop of rinna house and glanced down as he rang the bell what he saw made him smile headmaster rinna greeted him do come in please make yourself her voice dwindled to a stop when she saw that he was holding something in his hand what is that i wondering the same he smiled as he held it out to her i found it on your doorstep she took it and blushed heartily perhaps you have a secret admirer rinna brought to her nose a rose that was the pinkish orangey hue of sunset mixed with peachy yellows it was an exquisite specimen and it smelled lovely and it reminded her of her eyes snapped open when she heard her guest chuckle sorry she said i ll uh i ll just put this in some water and bring in some refreshments please take a seat she gestured into the living room and then turned to dumbledore with a hint of a smirk in her smile and a cheeky look in her eyes would you like some tea albus she asked sweetly there is no need for impertinence arinna you know perfectly well what kind of repast i am hoping for young lady he called to her as she entered the kitchen her laughter trickled out from the kitchen door when she emerged a few minutes later carrying a tray that she set on the coffee table dumbledore said well arinna i am glad that our good professor lupin suggested you contact me you have provided me a solution to a small dilemma i have i wonder if this might be to your liking for i think it affords an excellent resolution for us both rinna looked at him in interest as she passed him a bottle of his favorite beer dumbledore took an appreciative sip before continuing as you are aware i have had a vacancy in the defense against the dark arts position and it has recently been filled i hired alastor moody there are many reasons not the least of which being that hogwarts will be hosting the triwizard tournament this year rinna made an exclamation of surprise but our good moody is a man with many demands on his time and not as much vigor as he used to have and had agreed to the job only on the contingency that we hire an assistant dada professor to help i believe that you would fit the newly created position of associate defense against the dark arts professor beautifully rinna eyed him with suspicion how convenient headmaster that this position opened just as i was determining to change employment and make use of my studies of the dark arts dumbledore face was guileless yes rather convenient indeed you wish to have a job in which your talents would be put to better use and appreciated i have need for additional help this year rinna sighed let be honest with each other albus you would much rather have me where you can keep an eye on me dontthink i dontknow the reason you fixed me up with tonks to have an auror in training and another of your prot g s watching out for me or watching me she looked at him without malice not that i blame you really i came back here a loose cannon and i suppose i could be still considered one dumbledore gave her a measured look since we are being honest arinna yes i was very concerned for you when you returned to england and i felt it best to keep you connected to our world in spite of your wishes i did want to keep an eye on you as you put it he reached forward and placed his hand on her forearm i hope you understand i have always tried to keep your best interests at heart i have known you for far too long to not care for you considerably but i must admit he went on that i have taken advantage of your talents and gifts in the past and dontthink i dontknow how you resented me persuading you to play spy and i am hoping to do so again rinna blinked at this the old fox is being quite open about his intentions for a change or is he dumbledore produced a satchel and took out a worn periodical a back issue of the journal of advances in potions opened it and slid it over to rinna he tapped the title of the article theoretical use of preservative potions in counteracting dark curses and said the article and the research behind it was brilliant my dear rinna looked at him flabbergasted you do know that after the article was published i was lambasted for using unorthodox methods and for printing how was it put ah wishful thinking and complete clap trap i was advised to change the topic of my dissertation and was cut off from any additional funding dumbledore stroked his beard time and again the majority of academicians have been unable to appreciate brilliance presented to them even when their noses are rubbed in it he chuckled fortunately i am not so afflicted with that type of nearsightedness there was a calculating glint in his eyes i confess that i want your considerable talents at my disposal and i hope to sweeten the proposal by telling you i want to fund your additional research into this fascinating topic you want to fund rinna said weakly certainly my reasons should be obvious if you could find an efficacious combination it would serve our cause well rinna considered this in silence for a moment so you dontintend for me to be teaching then she asked unable to completely hide her disappointment at this he smiled at her on the contrary you will be teaching after all the board of governors will believe that is what i wish to hire you for i really have no intention of revealing my ulterior motive for having you at hogwarts to them and moreover did i not say that i intended to take advantage of many of your talents rinna stood up and paced around the living room deep in thought dumbledore leaned back and pulled on the bottle in his hand watching her sharply finally she turned to him a picture of seriousness and said albus how can you be sure i serve your cause or more accurately that i will continue to serve your cause rinna had spent a good deal of time that week mulling over her recent embarrassing behavior and had come to realize that she would not have reacted to sirius letter to harry so strongly had the accusations not held the potential for truth after all she continued pointing at her curriculum vitae laying on the coffee table you have in front of you a recipe for a powerful dark arts practitioner she paused then said softly you know why i came back i was very nearly consumed by it all how do you know that wonthappen again dumbledore looked at her artfully because i believe that now you have something that you lacked a few years ago what is that she wondered an anchor for your heart he replied two anchors really or you would have them if you would stop allowing the circumstances of the past to hinder your joy for today you re talking about harry and sirius yes dumbledore patted the couch next to him and she sat without thinking love my dear arinna love is the one thing that will hold back the darkness be it the darkness in this world or the darkness in one soul i have seen you over the years overcome the shadows within you through the love of your friends it wasntuntil you left and isolated yourself from those who love you that you began to feel the draw of the dark it true oh merlin it all makes sense she had certainly mucked it up hadntshe leaving like she did rinna was suddenly irritated that dumbledore hadnttold her this thirteen years sooner ruefully she realized that he had tried but she had been hell bent on departing and pursuing her course and had not heard she put her head in her hands and let out a little groan dumbledore let out a long sigh i afraid i must apologize to you arinna for i fear i did you a disservice helping you subdue your memories when you were young she looked at him in surprise but before she could say anything he continued yes i know they were horrific and quite honestly i do not know what else could have been done it was clear you needed some way to cope or you would not have been able to concentrate on your studies and i refused to see a student with such potential not have it realized but i fear that my example taught you a less than adequate way to handle adversity i not sure i understand she said in a small voice i taught you that the best way to deal with painful memories was to suppress them tamp them down hide them away now you are paying for that lesson are you not he placed his hand on her shoulder had you learned to ah now what is the muggle term for it ah yes process your feelings i daresay you would not be so conflicted over the recent return of one sirius black rinna felt as if she d been struck utterly dumb she would not have been able to speak had she tried so rattled was she by what had been said dumbledore added i had hoped that meeting harry again would help you sort through some of your painful past and give you a reason to let go of some of the responsibility you have so needlessly heaped on yourself what what do you mean his blue eyes pierced to her heart let go of the guilt my dear there is no need to hold on to it anymore and it does you harm if you continue to do so he removed his hand from her shoulder after giving it a gentle squeeze rinna sat in complete stillness for a while you have given me a lot to think about she commented softly all my life you have been challenging me haventyou pushing me to do my best guiding me in the way i should go and now i have offered you another challenge he took the documents from the coffee table and rolled them up neatly so what say you to my offer shall i submit this along with your application and a new parchment suddenly appeared on the table with a quill and inkwell ready to the board of governors it is not a given but i tend to get what i want when it comes to the staff at hogwarts she seized the quill and filled out the application why not i ve not been one to refuse you very often you know his eyes twinkled as he replied oh i dontknow about that you certainly refused to comply with my request to refrain from passionate snogging sessions in broom closets with a certain marauder as i recall she looked at him sourly i do hope that you do not punctuate staff meetings with embarrassing anecdotes such as that one because it is not too late for me to tear this up you know dumbledore hastily snatched the parchment from her hands and added it to the roll certainly not well at least not until mid term he added with a wily chuckle rinna snorted besides she added you know that mcgonagall completely over reacted to that incident dumbledore raised his eyebrow at her to all those incidents really dumbledore wisely said no more and finished his guinness remus lupin stood on rinna doorstep finger poised at the doorbell his heart drumming nervously in his chest it was ridiculous really to be apprehensive after all he d been here many times before he took a deep breath and remembered the owl he d received dear remy the potion is ready i daresay in the nick of time so you may come over anytime you wish you need to take the first dose in the next 24 hours so tomorrow morning i working just one shift tonight so ten o clock wouldntbe too early stop making that face that i know you are making love r he d been surprised at the tone because it had read like any other note or letter she d ever sent him there was no sign of their recent involvement in it as if she was acting like nothing had happened between them he wasntsure if he should feel relieved or hurt he wasntsure what he should feel about her or about coming over to her house where they would be together alone the door opened suddenly startling him into pressing the doorbell rinna stood in the doorway her arms crossed eyeing him with a smile on her face well it appears that we have this backwards shall we try again she chuckled as she started to shut the door on him he extended his arm to stop the door from closing very funny were you trying to give me a coronary i most certainly wasn t why go to all the trouble of brewing your potion if i intended to have you kick off on my doorstep her smile turned cheeky i was just wondering how long you were going to stand there staring had you forgotten how to ring the bell so this is how we are going to play it huh you know i dontneed to stand here and suffer harassment from a saucy wench like you i can get that as easily at mundungus place she laughed as she turned for the kitchen does dung keep many saucy wenches about then i wouldntbe surprised the lecherous lout that he is remus followed her and how would you know that he is lecherous please that is common knowledge she placed her hand on a box sitting on the kitchen table let me show you something she opened the lid and remus saw that there were bottles nestled safely inside these ones with the purple stoppers are for this month she explained i brewed a double batch and added a preservative to half so the red stoppers are for next month remus frowned a little i ve never heard of adding a preservative to it what did you add will it change the effects she tossed a periodical at him it was may issue of the journal of advances in potions he turned to the table of contents and saw the article on recent advances in wolfsbane potion he skimmed it with interest it will keep the potion efficacious for up to six weeks after that well it would be like what you experienced last month i contacted the research team at st mungo s they did trials for two years before the article was published they are hoping to be able to preserve it up to four months eventually she studied him seriously you know i wouldntgive you something that i didntthink was safe or effective remy he looked up at her of course i know that rinna he closed the journal and set it on the table and you know how much i appreciate this dontyou he asked indicating the box as if i would ever not consider doing this for you i glad you asked she held his gaze as she smiled at him but their eyes locked just a little too long for propriety and rinna hastily cleared her throat and looked away so uh i ll brew some every month with the preservative and so we ll always be a month ahead that way if i ever bollix a batch remus snorted as if that would ever happen she looked at him sharply catching the look of amusement on his face and continued or if for some reason i cantbrew it that month well then we have backup he crossed his arms and leaned one hip against the table thank you you ve no idea how much peace of mind this gives me rinna put the lid back on the box and took out some twine to secure it as she fumbled with the knot she was acutely aware of the awkwardness in the silence between them so where will you spend the next full moon then she asked remus shrugged someplace quiet someplace deserted i suppose i have a cellar here you d be safer than off in some wood or abandoned warehouse you know she told him he kept a neutral expression i dontthink it would be a good idea for me to stay here he said gently rinna sat abruptly at the kitchen table and put her head in her hands bloody effing hell she whispered what is it remus asked in concern i may not make mistakes when it comes to potions remus but i first rate at botching relationships it seems she said miserably she looked up at him and before he could say anything she said i so sorry remy he sat down next to her about what i sorry remus because i haventbeen fair to you he thought he understood you are regretting what happened between us he commented yes well no no regretting is not the right word i liked what we had going on whatever it was to be honest it just that i was being very selfish remus and i wasntbeing very honest with myself and therefore not honest with you i understand rinna you could never love me in that way no that not what i mean she pushed the chair back abruptly as she stood she stalked over to the teakettle and filled it setting it on the burner to boil i was scared remus and confused when you told me the truth about sirius and you were there solid and dependable like a rock like you have always been for me and she let out a heavy sigh and i feel like i ve used you and i afraid that i ve buggered up our friendship remus crossed the kitchen and took her by the arm shaking her gently if you are going to insist on assigning blame rinna then be sure to shoulder only your fair share we were both drunk that day but i still knew i was crossing a line and i didntcare he let go of her and raked his hand through his hair so if anyone was using anyone it was me taking advantage of you while you were vulnerable you could never take advantage of anyone she exclaimed indignantly it not in your nature he laughed and leaned his hip against the counter facing her i can always count on you to completely overlook my faults canti then he grew somber again i ve always known where i stood with you you know there were lines i drew in my mind boundaries i d set that i d refused to cross but i had reached my limit of watching you torture yourself and seeing the sorrow in your eyes and i thought that if i could just make them light up with happiness he looked at her sadly but i not the man who can do that i so sorry remy i was doing everything i could to avoid realizing that i am still in love with sirius and it wasntfair to you at all her voice dropped to a whisper he turned and leaned back against the counter with a sigh i knew you were still in love with him he saw the question on her face that night you were lying in my arms but you were dreaming of him and it was his name on your lips her eyes grew wide but before she could apologize yet again he continued i went into this with my eyes wide open rinna i knew where your heart was i was being selfish too there was a time when you said to me that when you were with me you felt like you would almost be all right and i was willing to settle for that but that wasntfair to you you deserve to be more than just almost all right you deserve to be happy rinna her eyes glinted with tears you deserve that too you know she said softly as she put her hand on his cheek his mind stirred with the memory of tonks on her balcony telling him much the same thing touching his cheek tenderly remus took her hand removed it from his face and held it loosely lost in quiet thought the whistle of the kettle broke their reverie she squeezed his hand and dropped it turning away to prepare the tea he sat down once again as she brought the teapot and cups over to the table they sipped in companionable silence finally remus stated in a didactic manner as far as buggering up our friendship goes i have a theory she couldnthelp but smile care to enlighten me professor our friendship has withstood many things most of them far more devastating than a few experimental sessions of kissing and whatnot she affected an affronted expression excuse me when was there whatnot i dontrecall any whatnot and if i participated in any without my knowledge well i going to be severely disappointed that i dontremember it she said mischief crinkling at the corners of her eyes besides i ll have you know that i am not a whatnot kind of girl she added in a haughty voice he grinned at that for how many years now had they couched their affection for each other and diffused their attraction for each other in humor this was comfortable and familiar and he felt a band of tension around his heart release oh dontyou try and tell me that you are not a whatnot kind of girl miss dunlevy he said as he wagged his finger in front of her face do you forget that teenaged boys share the sordid details of their romantic conquests with their best mates rinna rolled her eyes ugh i am so glad i was not aware of that in school or i would not have ever been able to face the rest of you even now her cheeks felt very hot but we ve strayed onto a huge tangent from the point i hope you have remy his face softened as the grin faded my point is this doesntbotch something as solid as we have we haventruined anything we ve just discovered a chink in the armor that we need to be careful about exposing again that all he told her he searched her eyes i love you always have and always will she understood i love you too you wolf she said fondly the conversation lapsed again until rinna said but i need to clear one thing up remy as far as me never being able to love you in that other way rinna he said in warning i think you re wrong i believe i could if circumstances were different but but they re not he said quietly and i cantlive on what might have been anymore she looked at him compassionately no and you shouldn t she replied but you need to know that you are loveable for the second time her words conjured the memory of a colorfully coiffed auror and remus smiled if you say so rinna then it must be true she smacked her hand down on the table at his remark finally it has taken years but it about time you figured that out sirius had spent the night in the woods explaining to harry that he did not want to impose on molly and arthur and knowing their good natures he was sure if they knew he was nearby they would insist on housing him harboring a fugitive not something that arthur should be caught at you know he said harry understood and had gone back to the house to pilfer some food and an old blanket and return the shears he d used to cut the rose harry had spent much of the next day monopolizing sirius as they talked about the old days at hogwarts sirius friendship with james the marauders adventures and quidditch ron and hermione were finally let in on the secret of sirius presence after they had become concerned that harry had disappeared completely having missed lunch and was likely in the throes of deep depression they had been rather surprised when he had popped in the side gate not long after they d started calling for him ginning in happiness quite the opposite of the despondent mess they d envisioned the three of them had convinced molly to let them have an evening of campfire in the woods with a late picnic dinner marshmallows and butterbeer i hope mum will let us do this again tomorrow night ron said around a mouthful of toasted marshmallows sirius tossed another log onto the small campfire unfortunately i will need to be leaving tomorrow he said with regret what harry protested why i plan on spending the full moon with an old friend sirius replied as he placed a hand on harry shoulder not that is makes up for all the years i couldntbe there for him harry swallowed his disappointment but after hearing sirius talk about his friendships that day he knew how much this meant to his godfather right he sighed so when will i see you again sirius looked at his godson affectionately i dontknow exactly when harry i wish i could tell you but being on the lam isntvery conducive to scheduling family get togethers you know harry felt all warm at the thought that sirius considered him family oh great hermione groused licking her sticky fingers i suppose this means you will be resuming your love affair with that scrapbook harry felt a little guilty at her remark he hadntbeen spending as much time with hermione as he would have liked lately i not having a love affair with it he began defensively oh no ron chortled you ve only been sleeping with it on the couch keeping it under your pillow in our room sounds rather like the torrid romance novels that hermione been reading hermione rounded on ron in indignation i have not been reading those trashy romance novels those are your mother s as if i would read such utter nonsense sirius sat back arms across his chest and took in the scene he was reminded so forcibly of memories of his mates and two ginger haired girls bickering good naturedly that he found that his eyes were wet when he trusted his voice again he held out his hands and said whoa whoa what this all about rinna left harry a picture album so he could see pictures of his mum and dad ron explained and harry been glued to it ever since harry made a noise of protest sirius eyes grew wide hang on it not a big one covered with green leather is it the three kids nodded sirius closed his eyes ta daaa you must look at my latest masterpiece rinna crowed placing the scrapbook on sirius lap opened to the pages she d just completed is that what kept you from getting here sooner sirius grumbled even as he admired the craftsmanship in front of him rinna gave him a light punch in the arm you know it the only time i get to behave like a complete girly girl you shouldntbegrudge me my little moments of relaxation ha he snapped the album shut and set it aside seizing her swiftly and pulling her into his lap i can think of other times when you behave like a girly girl he said with a suggestive leer she playfully swatted at him got just one thing on your mind haventyou blackie she giggled he wiggled his brows at her and grinned especially when i have you sitting on my lap he tilted his chin and captured her lips with his sirius sirius eyes snapped open at the concern in harry voice i remember that album he said quietly i sorry for mentioning it sirius hermione apologized for bringing up bad memories sirius studied her for a minute just because memories might be painful doesntmean they are bad he said with a significant glance at harry and i suppose that it may actually be a good thing to think about the painful memories particularly if that inspires you to make the first move to forgive and forget harry went to sleep that night with those words of his godfather nudging at his heart this has been the longest i ve ever taken between updating chapters i am very sorry and will try not to let that happen again i hope that the knowledge that the next chapter is well on its way to being completed in some way makes up for my tardiness and thanks to everyone who rose to the occasion in my review challenge and pushed me to 108 reviews i love you all so much gets all mushy here kerichi says i should thank you all by name and she is right so my humblest gratitude to darkened angel 16 cat sj coryna passerby2 kez marybeth jerrac jackie rogers heather kerichi lorett blckamthyststar rain and last but not least purple starz83 who was my 100th reviewer hugs to you all alrighty then seeing as i so giddy from all those reviews keep the love coming folks and leave a review for chapter 13 15 a new definition of family chapter 14 quidditch correspondence and conversations disclaimer i must despondently report that i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe i seriously considering begging jkr to let me have them because they are just so much fun to write about speaking of which any characters places situations or whatnot that you dontfind in her fabulous books well they are mine also i have quoted directly from jkr harry potter and the goblet of fire and i will give credit in the author note at the end please join me and lift your glass filled with your choice of festive beverage in a toast to my dear friend and beta extraordinaire lorett if it hadntbeen for her persuasiveness about 9 months ago this story would not exist anywhere but in my mind dear rinna i sorry about how everything went last time i hope you arenttoo angry or anything i just wanted to let you know that i looked up your broom in that book you gave me and it is worth a lot now so you should probably consider coming over to retrieve it because charlie keeps mooning over it like it was his girlfriend and i dontthink any of us will be able to stop him if he decides to elope with it anyway mrs weasley has been wondering when you are going to come to get your things and i think she is going to invite you for dinner soon i hope you ll come i still haventhad a chance to talk with you about my mum sincerely harry rinna luv it has been nearly two weeks where have you been now you know i dontlike to meddle dear but really harry has been moping about looking at that album you ve left him you know that he found out in just a matter of a few weeks that he had a godfather and a godmother and yet neither of them has been available to him really that is as cruel as dangling a ferret in front of a hippogriff and snatching it away i suspect that you are feeling embarrassed about all the incidents with sirius i hope you can put all that behind you and come to dinner say tomorrow night or the night after you do have your broom and clothes to pick up and it is not too late to set things right with your godson you know i only say these things because i care about you dear love molly dear molly it is reassuring to me to know that your mastery of laying on the guilt in thick layers like jam has not diminished one iota yes i am embarrassed and feeling like an utter idiot about those fiascos with sirius yes i feel like complete dragon dung for disappearing from harry life after dropping off that album yes i will accept your invitation to dinner but it will have to be the night after tomorrow due to work i will try not to disappoint you and incur any more of your wrath and since when have you not liked to meddle thank you for loving me and mothering me and please next time try not to hold back on the scathing tongue lashing love rinna dear harry thanks for letting me know about the invitation i ve actually just responded i coming to dinner the day after tomorrow please know that i was never angry with you harry i rather embarrassed at my behavior and i afraid you ve probably gotten a miserable impression of me so far so i hoping to rectify that in a few days i ll try to behave myself and we shall definitely take some time to talk about your mum i really do want you to know what an amazing person she was as for my silver dart please make sure that charlie isntdrooling on it or pawing it needlessly and for merlin sake do not let him abscond with it i am trusting you to guard the virtue of my broom harry i know you are up to the task hoping to do a better job of being your godmother rinna arthur weasley burst into the burrow and shouted triumphantly i ve got em i ve got em box seats what do you think of that eh his announcement was greeted by a chorus of cheers arthur looked around the dinner table at the people gathered there until his eyes locked onto his wife sorry about being late to dinner dear but this makes up for being called in on my day off dontyou think he grinned at her well i suppose molly said grudgingly but there was a smile on her face nonsense said arthur of course it does he came up behind his wife and placed a kiss on the top of her head do you know what this means my love he asked molly i presume that we will be breaking out the old tent she supplied yes he pounded his fist on the table in emphasis we shall be breaking out the old tent another round of hurrahs and whistles went up nearly deafening everyone there arthur moved along the table as he navigated his way to his seat placing a hand on rinna shoulder for a quick squeeze as he passed her well here my wayward girl good to see you rinna he said you will be joining us i trust in the top box his exultant look threatened to split his face right in half baffled as she was rinna couldnthelp but smile at all the infectious excitement and especially the jubilant expression that arthur wore she shrugged apologetically well i suppose i could if i knew what you all were going on about arthur looked at her incredulously as he took his seat what have you forgotten that england is hosting the quidditch world cup rinna mouth made an o of realization she was surprised to be included in the weasleys plans especially since such choice seats were hard to come by and honestly she hadntexpected to be adopted so seamlessly back into the family fold after so many years out of touch better to let them think that she had forgotten goodness that monday isntit you are coming arentyou arthur and harry spoke at the same time as rinna gaze moved from arthur to harry her heart gave a little wrench to see the eager hopeful look on his face there was no way out of it not if she didntwant to be a huge disappointment to her godson again besides they were top box seats she grinned at harry i wouldntmiss it for all the galleons at gringotts harry gave her his high voltage grin and bobbed in his seat with emphasis brilliant rinna resolved that she would make damned sure that harry had more occasions to wear that dazzling smile she looked around the room at all the happy faces there was no way in hell she was missing this opportunity she d just have to tell dorrie to find someone else to use the ticket she d already purchased with her auror friend harry stepped out to the back porch looking for his godmother he found her down by mrs weasley rosebushes and he swallowed nervously when he noticed which bush she was inspecting he cleared his throat and said i ve brought out some cookies she turned and eyed the plate he was carrying mmm chocolate chip she took one and bit into it molly makes the best chocolate chip cookies she licked the melted chocolate from the still warm from the oven cookie off her fingers harry mumbled agreement around his third cookie and following her lead licked his fingers too rinna cocked her head and looked at him so she said softly is sirius still here she almost laughed at the expression on his face like he d been caught filching the cookies he d brought her he swallowed and answered uh no not anymore he left before the full moon said he was going to spend it with professor lupin he tried to read her expression but it was difficult to do in the deepening twilight how did you know harry was relieved to hear a low chuckle it took me a few days to remember where i d seen a rose like that before and it seemed peculiar to me that it wasntdelivered by owl like the last one he sent me but left on my doorstep instead unless it was so i wouldntsee the owl that delivered it and recognize her snowy white plumage she quirked an eyebrow at him i just put together the facts and concluded he was here harry hoped it wasntwishful thinking on his part but she sounded a little disappointed that sirius was gone something she d said caused his brows to come together hang on he sent you another rose she chuckled again yes the day after i made such an ass of myself when i d read that letter harry could tell she was smiling when she said it classic sirius really sending me an anonymous rose by owl her voice definitely sounded dreamy harry grinned this was promising you know what i think he asked his tone practically dripped with i know something you dont what was the amused reply as rinna crossed her arms i think he wants to get back together with you rinna stared at him and a bizarre image popped into her head of harry ghost writing the dear alberta column in the sunday prophet she was quiet for a spell before she said more to herself than harry yeah but i dontunderstand why he would harry gave a small snort well i dontunderstand it either then he realized the words came out sounding wrong i i mean i dontget why it has to be so hard he likes you you like him you were engaged she eyed him sharply did he tell you that harry looked a little sheepish ah no i figured it out from the pictures you gave me i thought i the concealment charm got broken he hastily explained she studied him suspiciously but did not press for more details so why dontyou just get back together he asked rinna sighed i wish it were that easy harry but it not it s let me guess he said sardonically complicated her expression was inscrutable as she studied him that would be an excellent one word summary yes harry asked is it because he a fugitive well that certainly makes it more challenging but he was looking at her with serious green eyes that reminded her of his mother lily never would have let her off without detailed clarification and she suspected harry had inherited her tenacity rinna took a deep breath and huffed it out through her mouth the difficulty harry is that i wronged your godfather i broke faith with him and the fact is you cantjust mend trust overnight it takes time to rebuild a relationship after something like that and it needs to be done slowly and carefully do you understand what i mean harry contemplated this then nodded his head slowly kind of like with you and me right a lump suddenly formed in rinna throat and her heart did a funny ka thunk in her chest right she croaked in a whisper unable to trust her voice to be steady once again her godson had swept inside her defenses with his scruffy hair and his mother eyes and his indomitable spirit and snatched away a piece of her heart like it was a snitch what chance did she have against the combined play of harry the seeker and sirius the chaser harry heard the odd choke in rinna answer okay i ll shut it now if you d like rinna cleared her throat no that alright maybe we should go sit down though and i think a change of topic would be good sure said harry turning for the porch will you tell me something about my mum rinna felt a new found appreciation for the muggle saying out of the frying pan into the fire but she was ready i will she assured him would you like to hear more about how we became friends she was treated to her second exposure of the evening to the megawatt grin harry was ecstatic over the wealth of information he discovered about his mum he kept asking question after question storing up everything rinna told him for later pondering he was sorely disappointed that their talk had to end because he d really only scratched the surface of what he wanted to know but he believed rinna when she told him that they would have more talks like this one in the future rinna was somewhat surprised that she found it much easier to talk about lily now than a few weeks ago it was bizarre but once she started she found it really not that painful to tell more and more about her beloved and sorely missed friend she still let harry lead the conversation though by asking the things he wanted to know respecting that this was his search in the end although she still felt an aching sadness for her loss she experienced a sense of contentment that someone else was now able to appreciate just how wonderful a person lily evans potter had been rinna looked up into the stadium and saw the top box the ministry witch had indicated she hoped she d given herself plenty of time being late for the start of the quidditch world cup would do nothing to further her cause to get back in the good graces her godson actually she felt that the two of them had made some good headway the other night after dinner but that didntstop her from being concerned about her fledgling relationship with harry she was hoping to continue the salvaging of it tonight especially if she was even considering dumbledore crazy proposal to teach at hogwarts which she was seriously her musings had carried her up the purple carpeted steps to the top of the stadium and she was relieved to see she had minutes to spare charlie caught her eye as she looked around the box and he waved enthusiastically the buzzing excitement and infectious smiles everywhere caused rinna to grin as she made her way to the weasleys hello old girl arthur greeted her warmly with a kiss to the cheek glad you could make it these are fantastic seats i cantthank you enough for she began slightly breathless from her climb nonsense this is a family outing and you are family rinna naturally you d be included he smiled at her paternally rinna returned his smile gratefully then turned and said hullo harry hermione ron she was greeted enthusiastically harry grinned at her isntthis fantastic she nodded in agreement grinning even more in response to their three excited happy faces the youngsters started talking animatedly about everything they d seen so far they were interrupted by the arrival of cornelius fudge the minister of magic who had the bulgarian minister in tow rinna moved away and quietly watched as harry became the center of interest poor kid he looks uncomfortable with all the attention rinna spun around at the voice to find bill at her shoulder watching the scene with her he smiled at her in greeting and continued at least he hasntgotten a swollen head well as far as i can tell he seems like a nice lad in spite of how he was treated by those awful muggles yes she began but her train of thought was derailed by the sight of a family of light blond heads malfoy of course rinna girl you couldntexpect to slip back into the wizarding world without running into some old school mates now could you she snorted amused that her mind was already schooling her for a politely fake interaction school mate indeed rinna had few fond memories of lucius malfoy from her early years at hogwarts and she remembered who it was that lucius had supported during the war she watched malfoy shake hands with fudge and then turn to arthur with a contemptuous look she barely heard malfoy soft slur good lord arthur what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house wouldnthave fetched this much the minister of magic of course missed the insulting comment and continued to prattle on rinna plastered on an impassive smile just as malfoy cold grey eyes swept across the row of red heads stopping suddenly and returning to her face his eyes widened slightly and then he smirked arinna dunlevy what a pleasant surprise he said his voice as smooth as polished marble the expression on rinna face did not change lucius her voice was genial and neutral harry looked at ron and hermione in surprise she knows him he mouthed silently to them they both shrugged this is quite a coincidence malfoy continued to see you here just days after your application crossed my desk rinna quirked an eyebrow at him i am on the board of governors for hogwarts you realize rinna nodded her head gracefully of course inwardly she cringed for she hadntintended to say anything to harry or the weasleys unless she was actually formally offered the position at hogwarts hermione grabbed harry elbow tightly did you hear that she whispered harry and ron nodded never taking their eyes off the scene you ll remember my wife narcissa of course malfoy commented in an unctuous manner and this is my son draco rinna inclined her head to each but before she could say anything malfoy spoke again tell me arinna you never married then narcissa informed me you were engaged to be wed to her black sheep of a cousin rinna gazed at him inwardly seething he was baiting her she could tell from his eyes hard grey eyes that held a hint of malice well she knew the rules of engagement in skirmishes such as this one couldntbelong to a pureblooded family without learning the game and playing it in one form or another in one life she lifted her chin and replied coolly smile still etched on her face yes i was to marry her cousin but as you well know certain circumstances prevented that from happening he chuckled as if she had said something witty ah yes i suppose it would be hard to wed a murderer when he was serving a life term in azkaban by this point the trio was exchanging uncomfortable glances with the rest of the weasley clan who were clenching and unclenching their fists harry realized he had actually raised his when draco malfoy caught his eye and sneered looking as if he was daring and perhaps hoping for harry to start any trouble rinna wanted to punch the smirk right off lucius malfoy face but years of upbringing and training in the pureblooded world as well as useful skills learned in the order those deep breathing exercises do come in handy now and then kept her in check it should have bothered her how easily she slipped back into the game like her foot slipped into a comfortable shoe but she was too busy feeling the rush of adrenaline pumping through her veins her mind was analyzing and plotting at lightning speed i wondering lucius she said pleasantly as if she were talking about how nice the summer evening was if there is a point to our lovely conversation because riveting as it is i think i could better spend my time enjoying the sights she gestured around the stadium and then presented him with a saccharine sweet smile rinna was rewarded by the barest of twitches in malfoy upper lip really arinna canti just be curious about an old school mate rinna mentally snorted at that dear lucius do i have to remind you that we spent only three years at hogwarts at the same time two of which you completely ignored my existence and the final of which you made my life quite hellish because you labeled me a blood traitor her voice remarkably was still quite aloof harry head snapped up at that interesting bit of information malfoy fixed rinna with a look of frosty disdain i must say when i looked at your file i was quite surprised when i made the connection between the woman with that impeccable resume and the little girl who caused so much trouble at hogwarts because she couldntseem to pick the right friends he stopped to flick a condescending glance up and down the row at the weasleys surrounding her but then i see that you are still associating with red headed riff raff the temperature in the top box suddenly seemed to drop to sub arctic levels malfoy snickered to himself triumphantly when he saw a muscle twitch in rinna jaw rinna green eyes snapped the weasleys took me in after my parents were killed malfoy then her voice dropped in pitch an event that i believe you are also well aware of her tone was positively glacial grey eyes narrowed you should be careful of what you imply my dear especially since i have some say in whether or not you will be offered this position you seek at hogwarts malfoy replied in a soft intimidating voice the hostile tension in the box was palpable everyone observing the scene jumped in surprise when rinna threw back her head and laughed lucius malfoy you d be a fool if you thought that i had everything riding on this one position i have submitted that very same application to schools all across the continent i am sure one of them would be pleased to have someone with my credentials working for them her smile was full of derision now i believe we have a quidditch match to watch harry was dumbfounded by the whole scene but nothing prepared him for what happened next having so tacitly dismissed the very affronted lucius malfoy rinna turned and graciously took narcissa malfoy hand it was nice to see you again after all these years cissy she said sincerely narcissa looked at her with unreadable blue eyes it was a pleasure to see you too rinna she murmured before turning away completely to find her seat draco malfoy shot the trio a look of contempt before joining his parents but harry hardly noticed did you hear that he hissed at ron and hermione what she called her yeah she called her cissy what the big deal ron whispered i more interested in knowing what that talk of a position at hogwarts was no harry sputtered impatiently what mrs malfoy called rinna hermione was puzzled i not following you harry she called her rinna harry was utterly frustrated by their obtuseness she told me that only her friends call her rinna he said trailing off significantly hermione eyes widened as ron said under his breath blimey d you think she was friends with malfoy mother back at school whatever reply harry was going to make was interrupted as ludo bagman blustered into the top box minister he addressed fudge ready to go when fudge answered in the affirmative bagman spoke the sonorus spell and his amplified voice welcomed the spectators to the final of the four hundred and twenty second quidditch world cup all eyes focused forward on the stadium and the altercation between rinna and lucius malfoy was forgotten as the team mascots began their shows after the spectacular ending of the match bulgaria 160 ireland 170 and after the quidditch world cup had been handed to the irish team and they had taken a last victory lap and after fred and george had demanded their payment for the bet they d made with ludo bagman on the outcome of the game the weasleys hermione harry and rinna gradually made their way down the purple stairs and out of the stadium while arthur was admonishing the twins to not tell their mother they had been gambling the rest of the group was talking animatedly about the astonishing outcome of the match they reached the weasleys campsite and arthur realizing no one would be able to fall asleep right away with all the boisterous celebrating going on invited rinna to join them for a cup of hot cocoa she hesitated at some point someone will remember my little t te t te with malfoy and ask questions she thought then she looked at harry laughing with his friends and realized she didnthave the heart to go she smiled at arthur and thanked him soon everyone was sitting in the tent mugs in hand rinna felt content as she sat and listened and participated as the group enthusiastically recalled various plays and argued about others and she watched with amusement as the twins took turns reenacting them with their spoons she laughed and cheered with the rest as george demonstrated viktor krum catching of the snitch to end the game so relaxed was she that it came as a jolt not unlike being doused with a bucket of cold water when arthur leaned over to pour more hot cocoa in her mug and said i say rinna what was lucius malfoy going on about some position at hogwarts that was what she loved about arthur weasley he was a get to the point kind of bloke there was no beating around the bush no couching questions in polite terms no innuendo or intrigue no wonder he did not get along with most of the other purebloods the tent had quieted to hear her answer she gave a big sigh professor dumbledore seems to think i may be of some use to him this year she began in light of certain events that will be happening at hogwarts she was interrupted by arthur harrumphing pointedly while charlie choked on his hot cocoa that i am not at liberty to tell you about she cast an admonishing glance at harry hermione ron and the twins who all looked like they were going to ask the question naturally any staffing changes have to go through the board of governors so malfoy has apparently read my application she shrugged as if unconcerned would you be teaching wondered hermione what subject added harry remembering the defense against the dark arts position had been vacated by professor lupin i really hadntplanned on saying anything about it yet mostly because the position has not been officially offered to me thus far i not one for counting my chickens before they ve hatched she told them effectively avoiding answering their questions what i want to know said bill his eyes twinkling is if you really have put in applications to other schools across the continent rinna laughed you ve called my bluff bill weasley if this does not come through then i remain at my current place of employment ginny asked what do you do rinna looked directly at her her eyes still crinkled in merriment at bill impertinence i a bartender she said easily ginny ron harry and hermione werentsure if she was serious or not and were too taken aback to press the issue further the conversation had returned to quidditch and it was getting late when rinna downed the last of her cocoa and stood up she raised her empty mug in salute to arthur and said thank you for the excellent refreshments and for a smashing evening everyone i off goodnight she smiled at harry who while disgruntled that he d not gotten any more information out of her managed a smile back bill and charlie offered to walk her safely to the apparition point and they exited one on each of her arms they had reached the queue for the apparition point and rinna was about to thank the two red headed men when she was startled to hear a cheerful voice well arinna dunlevy have you come down from your top box to mingle with us low landers rinna smiled and started to speak before she even turned yes dorrie darling but i sure you found yourself some handsome bloke to sit next to you and didnteven miss me at all rinna voice trailed off in surprise as she completed her turn and came face to face with tonks and remus lupin was looking at her with an amused smirk and one eyebrow cocked rinna gaped for a long second before her wits returned to her she shifted her gaze from remus face to tonks nice job dorrie you got the best of the bunch i see remus crossed his arms and snorted smooth recovery rinna years of study under the famed marauders have made me what i am today rinna quipped she turned to the men at her side charlie bill i believe you know my friend tonks auror chameleon and best roommate ever nymphadora tonks bill smiled suavely and shook her hand it great to see you again it just tonks bill she grinned at him and it good to see you too she turned to his brother wotcher charlie tonks charlie said as he bowed exaggeratedly over her hand he straightened and looked at remus blimey lupin it seems that every time we see you lately you re in the company of a beautiful woman charlie was wearing his most charming grin as he glanced sideways at tonks to see if she d caught the compliment she had and blushed remus drawled what can i say charlie it a gift he noticed that both women were casting appreciative smiles at the dragon tamer and felt a sudden nudge of possessiveness to his dismay tonks was speaking inviting the two weasley upstarts to join them remus and i were going to go for drinks if you lot want to join us the lads looked tempted but bill sighed and said thanks but we probably should get back he looked at charlie who nodded looking disappointed bill smiled at rinna having done our duty as chivalrous men of honor madam by seeing you safely here and noting that you are now in the company of friends we bid you adieu he executed a small bow charlie rolled his eyes donttry and show me up bill you only embarrass yourself he turned and grasped one of rinna hands holding it dramatically to his chest all my living hours will be torment from this moment until i lay eyes on you again milady rinna laughed and extricated her hand you two are incorrigible flirts did you know give my best to everyone i had a wonderful time the two cheerily waved and returned to the camp rinna turned to see remus scowling they have a lot of cheek he grumbled will your head shrink down enough that you can join us for drinks he asked rinna a bit sourly she frowned at him ha ha i suppose you think that i get off on young men showering me with compliments and flirting outrageously with me do you feeling a little out of sorts about that are you tonks rolled her eyes those two picked the oddest times to go off on their little tiffs so shall we go for drinks suggested tonks pointedly her companions looked at each other and shrugged smiling a little ruefully might as well said rinna the night is still young and the company is good harry lay gracelessly on top of the covers of the bed in the room he shared with ron having only managed to kick off his trainers and pull off the sweaty t shirt he d been wearing for the impromptu quidditch game he and ron the twins and the eldest weasley siblings had played it had served as a means of letting off steam after the long and frightening night that had followed the quidditch world cup because no matter how tired they d felt as they staggered into the burrow that morning everyone had been too wound up to go right to sleep but now ron was already snoring softly and harry was in that weird state of being aware of his surroundings but dozing at the same time his mind kept replaying the events of the night before and visions of wizards in masks terrified muggles suspended midair and the dark mark hanging low and ominous in the sky swirled together as fatigue finally claimed him and he slipped into unconsciousness soon the disturbing images began to meld with memories of a strange dream he d had a few nights ago the snake in the dark mark glides out of the skull and begins to slither up the stairs to a room lit by a fireplace and wormtail is there he speaks to a wizard in a mask but the mask disappears and there is no face only a glittering skull in the sky an old man slumps to the floor and is suddenly suspended in the air upside down and a voice comes from the antique armchair facing the fire a voice that sounds so familiar sounds like a woman he knows like his godmother is anyone there arthur harry sweet merlin please tell me everyone is all right harry came up from the nightmare sluggishly willfully dragging himself into consciousness as the dream stubbornly clung to him like ankle deep mud sucking and adhering to him finally as he clawed his way into wakefulness he felt like there was an almost sickening slurp of suction as the dream released his mind he gasped and sat up tentatively bringing his hand up to rub his scar but it only ached the tiniest bit not like after the dream from the other night he looked wildly around disoriented and saw ron sit up bleary eyed what is it mate ron asked unsettled harry shook his head to clear it then he and ron heard voices drifting up the stairs mrs weasley bill and charlie and rinna her voice sounded very strained and mrs weasley sounded concerned harry grabbed a clean t shirt and threw it on before heading for the stairs ron at his heels he stopped near the bottom to listen molly i sorry for barging in like that rinna was clearly shaken and her words came out in a rush i woke up late and went for a run and i finally stopped to pick up the paper and saw this harry heard the plop of a newspaper hitting the kitchen table and i panicked mrs weasley answered sit down luv you look as transparent as a ghost i ll fix you some tea and we ll tell you what happened harry could hear the sound of a teapot filling with water bill be a dear and fetch the bottle of ogden for me harry could hear bill moving toward the living room so he stepped down the rest of the stairs rather than be caught eavesdropping ron followed him bill glanced at them as he passed hey you two i thought you were sleeping mrs weasley said in a disapproving voice but she set out two more teacups rinna brought her hand to her forehead oh no did i wake you harry noticed that she did look rather pale and her mouth was drawn with worry nah harry lied ron shook his head taking his cue from harry they sat at the table and accepted tea from mrs weasley with thanks harry noticed that mrs weasley poured some ogden old firewhiskey into rinna tea and that rinna hands were shaking as she sipped it her eyes kept drifting to the large black and white photo of the dark mark on the front page of the daily prophet harry wondered how many times she had seen that mark in the past harry ron charlie and bill explained to her everything that happened after she had left the campsite she grew even paler if that were possible especially when harry explained that it was his wand that was used to conjure the dark mark was anyone killed she whispered not that we know of answered bill then why would they cast the dark mark she wondered we saw someone cast the spell but it was far away from where the death eaters were ron said but if the death eaters didntcast it then who did rinna wore a perplexed frown as she tried to puzzle it out dunno said charlie but i suppose that what dad is trying to figure out at the ministry right now have a little more tea rinna mrs weasley offered and without waiting for a reply she refilled the cup from the kettle and added some more whiskey rinna gave a small smile of thanks feeling any better dear the motherly woman asked solicitously rinna placed her elbows on the table and rested her head in her hands it was just such a shock seeing that picture in the paper she said softly and knowing that you all were there mrs weasley stood behind her and put her hands on the upset witch shoulders everyone is safe she said soothingly rinna nodded and sipped her tea still looking worried eventually rinna said well i should be going you lot look like you could do with some sleep she gave harry a little smile and he had the feeling that she didntbelieve that she hadntwoken him and ron harry suddenly had the idea to tell her about his odd dream a few nights before and that his scar had hurt rinna he said quickly can i talk to you before you go of course she answered quizzically she looked around shall we go to the living room yeah he answered with some relief wishing for privacy what is it harry she questioned once they were alone harry fidgeted a bit nervously well i had a strange dream about three days ago i wrote sirius about it but hedwig hasntcome back with an answer yet and i wanted to know what you think a flush finally colored rinna pale face and harry thought she looked rather pleased that he was asking her advice tell me about it she suggested so he told her all the details he could remember about wormtail and the old muggle man and voldemort plotting to kill harry and then there was a flash of green light and i woke up and my scar was hurting has your scar ever hurt before she queried yeah yeah it has whenever voldemort was at hogwarts harry noted again that she didntflinch at the name but i dontsee how he could have been near here right she said thoughtfully harry haltingly asked do you know why my scar would hurt and do you think it was just a dream she looked at him appraisingly i haventheard about curse scars hurting she told him i ll look into it and to be honest it sounds a little too detailed to be a dream besides how would your mind come up with those images i suppose it could some dreams have symbolic meanings you know or at least most people think so she looked apologetic i no help at all am i he tried not to look too disappointed but then again he felt like he could be honest with her well uh not really she looked him up and down and harry felt like she was sizing him up seeing if she thought he had enough mettle harry i think that this isntjust a dream i dontknow exactly what you saw but it does seem a bit of a coincidence that it happened just days before all of this dark mark business now doesntit harry nodded he was afraid she might say that i ll tell you what she stated i will do a little research on this and if i come up with anything any explanations i will let you know and will you be sure to tell me if you remember any more details or if you have the dream again okay harry agreed thanks she gazed at him and her expression softened i glad you felt like you could tell me about this harry she said quietly he looked at her seriously thanks for listening and for not telling me i d gone barmy i will always listen to you harry i promise anytime you need me to all right he grinned yeah she reached her hand to his shoulder and gave it a squeeze before pulling him into a quick hug now go get some rest scamp she said affectionately and she ruffled his hair harry didntfeel any better about his dream or the events at the qwc but he still couldnthelp the grin on his face as he made his way back upstairs and to bed talking to his godmother about his worries had definitely been a good idea author note 1 in the paragraph where lucius malfoy speaks to arthur weasley it isa quote directly from harry potter and the goblet of fire from chapter 8 the quidditch world cup 2 i hope you enjoyed this chapter originally it had a lot more to it but i realized that much of it was superfluous to the plot and needed to be cut so i hope this was satisfactory for everyone please please please review and tell me what you thought i am grateful for everyone who reviewed my last chapter coryna sj kerichi heather cat kez abril blckamthyststar and nurray hugs and kisses to all of you 3 my fabulous beta lorett who deserves heaps of praise suggested that i post the stuff i cut out down below for anyone who is interested to read kind of like the deleted scenes from a dvd it is a little glimpse into what remus tonks and rinna did after leaving the qwc to go have drinks like i said it did nothing to advance the plot and was a bit silly really so i stopped writing it midway but it was fun to write and so i will share it with you now remus and tonks found a table near the dance floor of the muggle club tonks had chosen rinna arrived soon after with a tray of shot glasses filled with a clear liquid a bowl of cut limes and a large saltcellar tonks groaned no dunnie not tequila that stuff is like dirty socks sucked on many dirty socks have you rinna asked archly i ll have you know dorrie that this is not that cheap nasty stuff you are referring to this is fine top of the line very expensive and very smooth sipping tequila it will roll down your throat like cream remus took an experimental sniff it doesntsmell like dirty socks he noted what are the limes and salt for if we re not going to do shots i thought you said this was for sipping it is rinna said patiently or it can be i being the friend that i am and taking pity on you and your refined tastes she smirked at remus impudently at that point decided to splurge and get the good stuff so we can enjoy ourselves of course if our goal is to get royally pissed then i ll get the cheap swill no no i dontthink it would be a good idea to get pissed remus hastily interrupted tonks smirked and eyed each of them knowingly well then do shots or sip as you see fit rinna divvied up the glasses and the three companions sipped comfortably and allowed themselves to unwind from all the excitement of the evening the sounds of dance music filled the club with a pulsing rhythm i feel like dancing tonks exclaimed who with me rinna glanced at her friend this seems suspiciously like use of the nymphadora tonks formula well we have the beverage and the exertional activity but only one of the sentient components she glanced at lupin who was looking at them quizzically but why not it close enough tonks laughed c mon you two rinna shrugged and grinned standing up to follow but remus shook his head oh come on remy rinna cajoled you owe me for the tequila you know he raised his eyebrows i see how it is you buy a guy a few drinks and suddenly expect him to do your nefarious bidding tonks laughed oh you poor baby feeling cheap and used are we remus nodded trying to keep a petulant look but the wicked twinkle in his eye ruined the effect he was going for dontworry remus we ll still respect you in the morning tonks teased wontwe dunnie rinna nodded emphatically as she hooked her arm under remus and hauled upward pulling him out of his seat she adopted the demeanor of a vampy movie actress and purred oh yes dahling we ll respect you she made the word respect sound very risqu in the morning at lunch time tea time whenever you want she had brought him around the table by this point so tonks latched onto the other arm and picked up the charade we have plenty of respect for a scrummy bloke like you professor her voice dripped with suggestive promise as she helped rinna pull him onto the dance floor all right all right remus laughingly conceded defeat i ll dance but only to stop you both from sexually harassing me tonks moved very close to him gyrating her hips to the music and placed her lips close to his ear to make herself heard you dontlook all that harassed to me lupin remus grinned and noticed that she made no effort to move out of his personal space a song or two later it was hard for him to tell because they all sounded the same to him remus made his escape back to the table he sipped on his last shot savoring the burn and taste of the liquor rinna knew her stuff muggle or otherwise he smiled at the girls as they had turned and waved to him laughing and then felt the need to wave back to them he didntrealize how the three of them carrying on must have looked until he heard a masculine voice behind him lucky bastard are they both yours remus snorted as if someone would actually think he was the type of fellow who could handle the two of them at once yeah they re both mine he stated sardonically turning to face the man who d addressed him the man obviously a working class bloke out having a few drinks with his buddies before heading home nodded and watched them dance and asked so are they into each other too remus rolled his eyes yeah right he didntrealize the man was drunk enough for the sarcasm to be lost on him the stocky fellow gave a loud guffaw clapped his hand on remus shoulder and said cor blimey two crackin birds like them you are one jammy bloke mister before making his way back to his mates in the back last a n ha ha sometimes i am amazed by what utter crap i capable of writing hope you got a little laugh from that hugs to all my wonderful readers 17 a new definition of family chapter 15 hogwarts disclaimer i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe and i dontlead a very exciting life either which is how i manage to find time to write stories using these wonderful characters that i do not in fact own please refer to previous sentence regarding said ownership speaking of which any characters places situations vintages or whatnot that you dontfind in her fabulous books well they are mine rinna opened her front door and slipped her arm around the elbow of her guest hullo what a handsome bloke like you doing on my doorstep she greeted him remus rolled his eyes and thus the schmoozing begins he sighed what are you going to try to sweet talk me into rinna she ignored his comment did i mention that you are looking especially dashing this afternoon mister er just what is your title now anyway remus straightened the collar of his worn shirt assuming a haughty manner i am an authenticator and crafter of magical documents and contracts she affected a simpering smile oh remy she cooed you make is sound so glamorous so sexy so bloody boring he suggested with a lift of his eyebrows hmmm took the words right out of my mouth but it cantbe any worse than tending bar and i donthave to dress like a tart remus cast her a sly look hey rinna sounded affronted but her grin belied that i dontrecall you objecting too much besides i donthave to dress like a tart anymore he laughed hear hear instead you will dress like a matron she looked aghast perish the thought really rinna i can see you in a high necked tartan plaid robe giving minerva mcgonagall a bit of competition in the fashion world of hogwarts he laughed again at the expression on her face she glared at him bite me remy not the best thing to suggest to a werewolf luv he followed her into the kitchen and you haventanswered my question you know she pulled a bottle of wine out of the refrigerator turned and regarded him with an innocent smile chardonnay she offered showing him the bottle he took it from her hands examining the label brutus shaw winery the finest wizarding vintage all right now i know you are up to something you wouldntbreak out our favorite cheap wine for just any old occasion she clicked her tongue really remy you are so mistrustful why wouldnti want to share a thirty knut brute with you especially when the occasion we are celebrating is our recent gainful employment she took the bottle popped the cork with her wand and poured two glasses handing him one cheers she clinked her glass against his he took a sip before he sat down at the table all right spill she slid into the chair next to him i need a caretaker for the house it would be closer to your new job you d only have to cover your food no listen before you shake your head it wouldntbe charity remus you d be doing me a favor keeping up the house and such i have to pay on it whether i here or not so someone might as well be here she began ticking off points with her fingers you d have a permanent place to stay no mundungus or other unsavory roommate the cellar during the full moon wait rinna slow down remus held up his hands let me get this straight you are suggesting that i stay here rent free not exactly you would stay here rent free in exchange for the upkeep of the property and before you think i offering this because i feel sorry for you or any other such nonsense you should know that it comes from purely avaricious motives i dontwant to pay for someone to come over to water the plants and do yard work remus snorted avaricious motives my arse you do not have a greedy bone in your body he swirled the wine in his glass staring at it case in point your generous offer rinna sighed in exasperation why cantyou see that this would be mutually beneficial he looked up from the glass oh i can see it and since you put the arrangement in terms of an exchange of services thus sparing my pride and even went so far as to hint that what i d really be doing is helping out a damsel in distress rather than accepting charity you have made me a rather palatable proposal so you ll do it she clapped her hands he smiled and shrugged i cantthink of a good reason why not a thought struck him are you sure you wontbe uncomfortable with me here when you are home on weekends or holidays she asked him seriously would you be uncomfortable not very i should think a cheeky smirk spread across his face as long as we avoid imbibing in alcohol while we are alone together rinna raised an eyebrow and pointedly lifted her wineglass remus smirk grew wider already a rule broken damn actually not she said airily as she went to the cupboard for another glass dorrie will be joining us shortly i cooking a celebration dinner for the three of us remus leaned back in his chair contentedly an evening of food and cheap wine in the company of my favorite girls a place to call home and soon a paycheck things are definitely looking up the scene in the shade of the large tree on the weasleys back lawn to an outside observer anyway was a shocking one bodies lay strewn everywhere haphazardly the sound of ragged breathing and groans pierced the humid summer air presently a throaty wicked chuckle floated over the group i cantremember the last time i ve had such fun harry raised his head from the soft lawn to eye his godmother what what about my birthday party you said that then you know rinna turned her head to look at him her eyes shining with mischief i suppose i did but at your party we didntend the quidditch games with a water balloon fight too bad your nefarious little plot backfired lads bill said to the twins as he sat up but to be honest it is so bloody muggy out here that after all that flying a good soaking was rather welcome fred and george merely sat up and gave their oldest brother a look that seemed to imply that this was what they had intended all along rinna sat up little bits of grass and leaves and other detritus sticking to her damp hair and clothes i say now that i have you all together at the same time there something i wanted to discuss with you lot she flicked her gaze at charlie and bill at least the ones returning to hogwarts in two days crikey what did you bring that up for demanded george and here we were trying to avoid thinking of the end of the holidays which explains this last hurrah celebrating the halcyon days of our summer added fred really rinna it in poor taste for you to bring up something we are all trying to put out of our minds he gave a delicate shudder rinna refrained from rolling her eyes and looked contrite i so sorry i didntrealize i was bringing up such a painful subject i hope i haventscarred you twins for life she said sweetly the rest of the group began to sit up one by one curious about what rinna had to say she sat cross legged her wrists dangling from her knees waiting for fred and george to finish their smart retorts as you know my application to teach at hogwarts was accepted what i want to talk about is how we should act toward each other when we are there are you teaching defense against the dark arts harry inquired well i will be assisting your new dada professor actually so yes but what i want to know is if you want it to be common knowledge that we know each other there was much discussion around the group on the lawn with bill and charlie giving input but in the end everyone deferred to harry since it was felt he would be most affected by any decision after all it would already be knowledge to some that rinna was a distant relative of the weasleys i think said harry carefully after much thought that we shouldntpublicize the fact that i your godson not keep it a secret necessarily but not really volunteer the information if you know what i mean he looked at rinna to see if she was upset she wasn t all right then we ll keep it under wraps for now it just as well since i cantbe accused of nepotism if people dontknow we re family she smiled at harry harry felt warmth permeate him at the thought of rinna considering him family do you mean that you ll make us your favorites then rinna asked fred a sly gleam in his eye she looked at him wryly in your case i d be more likely to be accused of being too harsh on you to avoid charges of partiality i afraid she gave the twins a look that conveyed i used to run with the marauders and i am ready for any of your little tricks george clutched dramatically at his chest you wound us we arenteven at school yet and you are assuming we ll cause trouble i wonder why rinna said drolly as she tossed a water balloon she d been hiding up in the air catching it neatly before chucking it at him hitting him square in the chest after dinner as rinna was preparing to leave harry was able to catch her alone uh rinna i hope i didnthurt your feelings or anything you know by wanting to keep it quiet that you re my godmother she looked at him shrewdly no but i appreciate that you were concerned that you had she smiled to be honest if i was in your place and you were in mine i d want to find out what kind of teacher you were before i made any open declarations of association with you i mean really are you fair an ogre incapable of teaching your way out of a haystack a funny look stole across harry face do you know how to do that mind reading thing he asked suspiciously legilimency you mean she responded i wasntusing it on you just then if that what you were thinking harry eyes widened then you can do it oh i not brilliant at it by any stretch of the imagination i always end up with a reaction headache i far more competent at occlumency which is blocking others from my thoughts she shrugged at any rate i just tried to see it from your perspective and that what i came up with i was spot on then pretty close he looked abashed it just that harry she said firmly i get it it all right you will be harry potter student except i imagine when you are causing trouble in which case you will be mister potter this was said in a fair imitation of minerva mcgonagall and if you are anything like your dad or your godfather i suspect it will be mister potter more often than not she was teasing him he could tell he put on his most ingenuous expression trouble me she pointed at his face there it is the patented marauder face of innocence i ve seen it many times my friend you are a natural she laughed a bit nostalgically but harry please know that i am taking my role as godmother seriously you can always come to me if you need me or just to talk anytime harry nodded thanks i d like that i think well then i will see you the day after tomorrow she smiled at him are you nervous he blurted and then regretted it wondering if he was getting too personal rinna snorted of course i am but more like in the way you get nervous before a big important quidditch match you know more excited than scared yeah he knew how that felt well the day after tomorrow then he gave her a quick awkward hug she ruffled his hair goodnight harry she apparated and was gone leaving harry standing alone with his thoughts the enchanted ceiling of the great hall of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry revealed the wickedly stormy weather outside but fortunately without the rain harry was seated at the gryffindor table with his friends eagerly awaiting the sorting partly because he had not been to one since his own his first year and partly because it meant they would be that much closer to eating he looked up at the staff table noting rinna sitting between professors sprout and flitwick she looked perfectly calm but there was an eager glint in her eyes as if she couldntwait for the sorting to start either did you hear me harry hermione was asking i said i wonder where the new defense against the dark arts teacher is there an empty seat by the headmaster i wish they d hurry i starving ron moaned but any further lament was cut short by the arrival of the first years soaked to the skin by the thunderstorm and professor mcgonagall placing the sorting hat on a three legged stool at the front of the hall the hat began its song rinna watched the sorting with great interest making silent bets with herself as to where each student would be placed it was a good thing that gambling was not one of her vices the hat was not predictable and there was no real rhyme or reason why it would take a long time to deliberate over one student and yet almost instantly sort another rinna sighed ever so slightly annoyed that she could not puzzle out the hat magic even after all these years and began eating her meal that had appeared before her rinna smiled a little wistfully at the beginning of term announcements especially at the list of filch newest forbidden objects were there really 437 of them now she wondered what had ever happened to the marauder map that filch had finally confiscated from sirius and james the corners of her mouth turned up as she nostalgically recalled the botched mission to try to retrieve it from filch office that nearly cost her her prefect badge during sixth year she probably should never tell harry and company about that little adventure seeing as she was supposed to be a good role model now just as dumbledore was about to announce that hogwarts would be hosting the triwizard tournament this year alastor mad eye moody made his dramatic appearance rinna mouth pressed harder and harder into a thin line as she watched him limp his way to the staff table as he sat down next to dumbledore rinna took a deep breath and let it out here we go as the students thronged through the doors to the entrance hall after their dismissal to bed harry looked back to the staff table and caught rinna eye she smiled at him and nodded a silent goodnight he managed a grin back at her before he was swept out into the hallway breakfast the next morning found ron hermione and harry going over their new class schedules they did not have defense against the dark arts that day the rustling of hundreds of wings caused harry head to snap up as the morning owl post began as usual neville longbottom got a package from his grandmother he was notorious for forgetting things harry frowned as a large eagle owl swooped low before depositing its hefty package in front of draco malfoy at the slytherin table no doubt it was an oversized tin of sweets and baked goods spoiled git that he was harry turned his attention to the staff table in time to see a barn owl deposit a letter and a long stemmed crimson rose in front of the new associate d a d a teacher he grinned as his godmother turned a little pink but mostly because others had taken notice of the delivery and the hall was filled with the sur surring sound of whispers even in only half a day speculation was running wild among the student body about professor dunlevy who was she why was she teaching in addition to moody how old was she was she married although it seemed that the last two questions were mostly being asked by the male half of the students harry smirked to himself he liked possessing knowledge that others did not breakfast ended and the trio made to exit the great hall to head for the greenhouses harry felt rinna gaze on him and he grinned as he pointedly eyed the rose in her hands and raised his eyebrows i know who that is from his look seemed to convey her brows came together but the corners of her mouth quirked as she tried to contain her own grin her green eyes twinkled he could almost hear her voice impertinent scamp rinna left her office with a look of satisfaction on her face her first day of classes with the sixth and seventh years had gone well and she actually was hungry for the first time that day now that the nerves that had taken over her stomach had settled she made her way to the stairs to the entrance hall already hearing the voices of the many students queuing up for dinner rinna feet picked up their pace unbidden at the sound of minerva mcgonagall shriek bringing her to the top of the marble staircase in time to see mad eye moody with his wand pointing at a snow white ferret that was bouncing up and down on the stone floor rinna had had the mcgonagall shriek directed at herself a few times in her life and she almost almost felt sorry for moody when the deputy headmistress squawked moody is that a student that is until he answered yep rinna quickly followed professor mcgonagall as the older witch ran down the steps and pointed her wand at the quivering little creature with a snap a disheveled draco malfoy appeared in a heap on the floor blond hair in disarray face red with humiliation while mcgonagall turned to harangue moody rinna surreptitiously cast diagnostic charms over the boy as he got to his feet she sighed in relief no broken bones or serious injury just bruises and by the look in his eyes a bruised ego as well rinna sighed again this time in frustration was moody daft this was no way to treat a student she didntlearn till later that draco ron and harry had exchanged words and draco had made disparaging remarks about molly weasley before harry had insulted narcissa malfoy prompting draco to fire a curse at harry while harry back was turned while she agreed with moody that it was a low cowardly thing to do she still took exception with how mad eye had handled the situation the part of her brain that had gleefully taken on the role of professor suggested that if young malfoy could fire a curse at such close range and miss then she or moody or someone had better get these fourth years up to snuff with their aim then the godmother portion of her mind mentally whapped her upside the head and huffily shrilled that shouldntshe be a bit perturbed that the snotty offspring of lucius malfoy had tried to curse her godson brilliant she muttered i here only one day and i already having arguments with myself harry and ron were still grinning at the memory of draco malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret when hermione excused herself from the dinner table and made off for the library fred weasley smoothly moved into the seat she had vacated and spoke softly to harry and ron had d a d a with the jee em this afternoon he said conspiratorially the jee em harry asked confused george had taken the seat opposite his twin yeah he huffed impatiently the jee em the jee em at harry and ron blank stares he rolled his eyes and whispered your godmother oh realization dawned on the two younger boys the g m i get it harry leaned forward well the older boys eyes met excellent they summarized in unison we re going to cover silent spells and wandless magic said george and blood magic and the unforgivables added fred lee jordan best friend of fred and george sat down across from harry you talking bout dunlevy class the other two nodded merlin it going to be brilliant we ve got to sit closer to the front mates i want to be able to watch those lips of hers move when she lectures lee eyes became a little unfocused fred leaned in and stage whispered lee a little bit sweet on her i afraid harry nearly choked on a bite of red potatoes ron slapped him heartily on the back while lee looked at him curiously you all right harry of course he is fred assured him tossing harry a wicked leer he just a little sweet on her too harry began coughing again well who could blame him lee pointed out she a red head i think red headed women are dead sexy dontyou george raked his hand through his own ginger hair and shook it out of his eyes all red heads are dead sexy he pronounced by the time harry had caught his breath and the redness of his face had faded the three sixth years were long gone footfalls echoed in the now quiet hallways as rinna began the last leg of her bedtime rounds she wasntexpecting too much trouble on the first full day anyway she knew from experience that the first day of classes tended to be stressful exciting and tiring the students didntusually start prowling about causing mischief until after the second or third day which was why she had volunteered for the first night of staff patrol she snorted let sinistra and sprout think they bamboozled me into taking first patrol she thought i ll use their little deception to my advantage later and so with a satisfied smirk and a little bit of a swagger she made her way through the school she found herself stopping at a particular window that looked out onto the lake and the grounds she reached into her robes and pulled out the letter that had come with the morning post accompanied by a rose lighting her wand with a silent lumos she studied it again it wasnta letter exactly it was a drawing of a spot she remembered well the pencil on parchment was a fair rendering of a moonrise over hogwarts lake as seen from a particular vantage point in the air the gibbous moon hung just above the hills and spilled moonlight onto the water she closed her eyes and could see the real thing in her mind with the light like liquid platinum on the lake surface until a tendril from the giant squid broke the smooth sheet of moonlight into a thousand tiny flickers she opened her eyes and looked again at the drawing scrawled on the bottom corner in familiar writing was having trouble getting back to london have been sighted i believe and i have to lay low to pass the time i think of you and how many times we basked in the moonlight and the stars in our spot above the lake seemingly as an afterthought the word over was scribbled at the very bottom she turned the parchment over rinna i have recently received an owl from remus c ongratulations on your new position at hogwarts i have no doubt that you will be a stellar teacher harry wrote me a letter telling me his scar hurt one morning last week this comes on the heels of some strange rumors i have heard which i dare not write here and i am very concerned i believe that dumbledore too is reading the signs as he not only got mad eye out of retirement but has hired you i feel better knowing that you will be at hogwarts with harry it is ironic perhaps that a few nights ago i drew this picture which i didntreally intend to give you but now it seems apropos and now when you get this letter you will be almost at that very spot i wonder if it is as beautiful as i remember it evidently i am out of danger for now so i am on the move once more which is why i can send you this note and i suppose you will recognize the message of the rose i not sure where i am going since my original plan was to come back to see you apparently you ve managed to run away again yours sirius melancholic that was a good word for what she was feeling now she looked up out the window again taking in a view she had seen many times many years before when she would sit in the window sill with her best friend and talk and giggle and dream now in the quiet darkness with the excitement and nerves of her first day teaching well behind her rinna felt as if all her breath had been stolen from her lungs as she realized that she had returned to the one place that held more memories of lily and james remus and sirius than any other spot on earth her heart quailed sweet merlin what the hell was i thinking she whirled around at the soft sound of a shoe scraping on stone i hope i didntstartle you arinna the headmaster said rinna quickly put on a smile i was lost in thought i afraid dumbledore nodded sagely i often find myself in that situation when i walk around the castle there are so many places that bring back a memory or two i hadntreally considered that all the memories this old castle holds for me i mean she glanced out over the darkened grounds of the school i suspect i will be finding myself in bittersweet reverie quite often he considered her kindly and yet it is the memories be they joyful or poignant that keep the ones we ve lost alive in our hearts is it not rinna turned to look out again and the headmaster joined her they stood silently for several minutes before he spoke i wanted to congratulate you on an excellent first day thank you she murmured he stepped away goodnight arinna goodnight albus rinna remained at the window with her thoughts and reminiscences for a long time before retiring to her quarters the second day of classes had begun and rinna was pleased that her stomach no longer seemed tied in knots making breakfast and her morning classes much more enjoyable the mid morning break afforded rinna the opportunity she needed to obtain information from the hogwarts potions master she strolled into the dungeon classroom and looked around literally spinning on her feet as she took in the changes it certainly looked different from slughorn classroom well as different as a dank dungeon could given the limited decorating opportunities afforded by such a setting she stopped mid turn when she caught the mordant look on the potions professor face as he watched her from the desk in the front of the classroom she studied him for a moment hullo severus she offered severus snape stood up and made his way around the desk to stand in front of it stiffly hello arinna may i assist you in some way he asked politely i hope so she said walking briskly to the front she couldnthelp but flick her attention to a desk in the front row on the far right side snape eyes followed the direction hers had gone before he returned his gaze to her face he smirked waxing nostalgic are we professor dunlevy his voice blurred her thoughts like a drop of oil smears ink on paper she looked into his eyes her face and voice devoid of expression i sure i dontknow what you are talking about she said smoothly she held out a parchment in her hand i have the inventory of the potions store room and i ve marked off the ingredients i would like to use snape took it from her and glanced at it did the headmaster inform you of my little project she wondered only that you had one you d be working on she nodded i wondering if you can tell me a reliable source for these ingredients since they are not in the stores or at least not on the inventory she watched as his lips twitched slightly in annoyance at her implication that he had a private storeroom she was right of course he looked at the new piece of parchment she had given him and his eyebrows rose just a little project you say arinna he murmured mockingly he watched her lips quirk into an ironic half grin turning quickly from her rather fascinating mouth he grabbed the quill from his desk and began marking her list you ll want to get this this and these marking as he went at fenwethers and the rest of these you should find at darklings grimm knockturn alley they have the fairest prices and the purest ingredients he handed the list back to her that is what you wanted to know isntit she looked up at him and smiled her thanks yes actually you have saved me the trouble of wandering around knockturn alley comparing prices and discerning cheats thank you if you want to go to the trouble of mentioning my name i daresay you will find yourself with the proprietors themselves and they will be disinclined to try to swindle you in any way her smile widened brilliant and again thank you she turned to leave snape took a few steps after her i read all your published articles they were no surprise to me quite excellent she turned to look at him a closed expression on her face i only published one article snape crossed his arms and eyed her shrewdly what i meant to say was i read the one you published under your given name he recognized the expression on her face from their school days it was the one that she wore when she knew she was not going to like what was said next and i read the ones that came out earlier under your german and chinese pseudonyms as well he watched as she opened her mouth to contradict him interrupting impatiently please arinna do not do me the discourtesy of denying my conclusions when i know i am correct i understand completely why you did not use your real name at least not until you thought you had it right she let out a long breath but i didnthave it right apparently she noted a trace of bitterness coloring her words oh but you did the problem was that you were writing for idiots who wouldntrecognize innovative potions work if it bit them on their sorry arses rinna made a rude noise that what dumbledore said only he didntput it quite so ah colorfully well then in this particular instance i will agree with the old man another smirk threatened to turn up the corners of his mouth curious she asked how did you know about the other articles i mean how did you deduce they were mine rinna was quiet as she waited for an answer seeing that snape was eyeing her astutely and appeared to be weighing how much he should say she didntwant to press the issue they had been having a surprisingly civil conversation up until now when he finally spoke she was momentarily distracted by the rich persuasive quality of his voice apparently severus had been one of those lads whose voice had continued to mellow and deepen even past puberty because she sure didntremember it being that velvety when they had been in school i wasntyour potions partner for four years for naught i ll have you know he said dryly i recognized your work i see she nodded accepting the explanation as sufficient then mischief flashed in her eyes a case of familiarity not just breeding contempt but recognition as well again he fixed her with a disconcerting gaze before deciding to throw caution to the wind certainly their interaction so far had been courteous and polite but he had promised himself that if he ever was given the opportunity to speak to her again he would say to her what he d wanted to the day he graduated from hogwarts i dontthink it was the familiarity that bred the contempt you know i believe it was your choice in lovers he watched as storm clouds of anger darkened her visage and felt a pang that the unusual accord they had found in the last few minutes would now be lost no matter he told himself he knew much better how to deal with her when she was in this kind of mood anyway so we are back to this are we she spat furiously he bore into her with his black hawk like eyes i could not understand how you deigned to give yourself to that git in the first place but i d hoped you would outgrow him you deserved far better you know and then i found out that you d agreed to marry him his voice dripped with condescension for a smart girl you were an idiot when it came to your heart the look on her face and the tone in her voice was loaded with censure are you quite through because you would do well snape to avoid these extemporaneous speeches on subjects you know nothing about she lifted her chin defiantly you do not know who or what i did or did not deserve and you certainly never earned the right to have any say in what i did with my life or who i gave my heart to merlin balls snape swore pointing an accusing finger at her you are still in love with him arentyou even after all he did sirius black did not murder anyone she said with conviction snape eyes widened in fury you believe that codswollop the werewolf told you or did you hear it from potter and his friends tell me arinna do you believe it so you can salve your conscience for being in love with a murderer rinna shot him a look of pure malevolence tell me severus does the dark mark you took for your lord still burn your forearm her eyes glittered as he unconsciously rubbed his left arm i could easily hold you in contempt for the decisions you made as a young idiot they stood mirroring each other legs apart hands on hips glaring daggers for several long minutes finally rinna let her hands and head drop and she heaved a sigh you say you cantunderstand the decisions i made and i really cannot fathom the ones you did but the thing is they are in the past she looked up again and i for one intend to keep them there we are just going to have to agree to disagree i suppose if we are to work together as colleagues now snape nodded slightly as his indignation drained away not unlike our agreement when we worked together in potions class he commented quietly a ghost of a smile crossed her face excellent point she conceded she nodded to him and turned to leave once again he stopped her with his comment you once told me in a fit of pique well actually you said this on numerous occasions but you told me that you were the best bloody potions partner i would ever have she did not turn around but her mouth crooked up at the memory i could be a bit arrogant at times she said ruefully well he drawled his voice like honey fresh from the comb you were right she nodded again accepting the figurative olive branch he offered and slipped out of the classroom rinna was beginning to think it had been unnecessary to talk to harry about how they should act toward each other at school since she hadnteven said two words to him or his friends since arriving three days ago which was why she was lurking in the corridor outside the classrooms she and moody had been assigned nodding at students and watching keenly for any sign of her godson or his sidekicks she had just about given up thinking they must have used one of the side corridors when she thought she heard ron voice he really knows his stuff moody doesnthe when he did avada kedavra the way that spider just died just snuffed it right ron comments ended abruptly and rinna saw why the look on harry face as they had come around the corner from a side hallway nearly broke her heart harry she said gently are you all right professor moody just showed us the unforgivable curses hermione informed her rinna looked carefully at ron and hermione all of them she asked comprehending the reason for harry bleak expression they nodded she put a hand on harry shoulder i sorry harry her words were weighted with meaning harry looked up at her and saw sympathy in her face have you ever seen it rinna the avada kedavra he half whispered his godmother winced as if a pain had jabbed through her skull yes she breathed more times than i want to remember hermione looked at ron she felt like they were intruding on a private moment harry looked down at the floor of course sirius said her parents were murdered she must have seen it then rinna next words were in a tight controlled voice the only good thing i can say about the killing curse as oxymoronic as that sounds is that its effect is instantaneous she watched harry reaction to her comment at least lily and james suffering had been brief which is why i suppose someone invented the cruciatus because the avada didntcause enough torment her tone was ironic harry looked at his two companions he his voice faltered he showed us that one too hermione finished for him the look on poor neville face rinna looked at her sharply neville neville longbottom he in our class ron explained is neville all right rinna asked with concern ron looked at the others who shrugged dunno he said moody came and took him to his office harry thought that rinna looked awfully concerned for a kid she didntknow then he remembered what sirius had said about her being very compassionate and empathetic rinna felt her heart go out to neville of course none of his schoolmates would know why moody demonstration of the cruciatus was so upsetting to him but his mother alice had been one of rinna good friends at hogwarts rinna knew all about the torture to insanity of the longbottoms by death eaters effectively leaving neville orphaned she felt a somewhat irrational surge of anger toward mad eye moody some of these children lose their innocence so early these days couldnthe have let neville and harry hold on to theirs just a little bit longer rinna harry said tentatively as he watched a scowl take over her face what wrong sighing heavily rinna replied only that there is so much evil that people invent curses such as these and because of that hogwarts has to teach children defense against the dark arts she attempted a smile i d much rather be teaching flying if i had my druthers the trio smiled weakly at her comment are you lot heading to the great hall for dinner rinna changed the subject at their nods she asked may i join you again they nodded and the four began their journey in silence oh hey harry suddenly said i ve been meaning to ask you what did siri uh snuffles have to say to his amazement his godmother blushed furiously uh i mean uh you donthave to say anything if it was private you know harry backpedaled usually private letters are private you know she reproved but i will at least tell you that he is fine he safe and he worried about you since you sent him that letter about your scar i will not tell you how fast my heart beats every time i re read it or how my heart aches when i look at that drawing they had reached the great hall harry noticed a subtle shift in rinna demeanor well you three she said briskly you know where my office is dontbe strangers and with a little nod she moved toward the staff table as harry sat down with his friends he realized what he had seen was rinna change from godmother to professor so far he liked both personas it really came as no surprise to rinna that she should find herself standing on the hogwarts quidditch pitch after dark that night her silver dart in her hand and a lightweight flying cloak on her shoulders after all sneaking out for late night flying had been one of the ways she had alleviated stress all those years ago and now that she was back at hogwarts she found herself slipping into some old hogwarts y habits she could have blamed her current itch to fly over hogwarts lake at breakneck speed on a need to blow off steam over her recent disturbing conversation about the killing and cruciatus curses or on the stress of her first few days of a new teaching job certainly those were contributing factors but if she was honest with herself the overwhelming reason she was there straddling her broom aching to fly was a certain image she couldntget out of her head damn you sirius and damn your bloody drawing too she circled around the lake before coming to a stop at a particular location above the water she was not shocked in the least that she found the spot exactly without even trying it had been instinctual she hovered taking in the view and sighed sirius and rinna stood side by side on the grassy pitch and surveyed the crisp december night sky the gibbous moon will be rising in a couple of hours sirius commented we dontwant to miss that she nodded in agreement she didntquestion how he knew this she was beginning to be attuned to the moon cycle as well i guess that what happens when you are friends with a werewolf she felt him drape the heavy flying cloak over her shoulders he turned to her are you ready he was rewarded with her happy grin and a nod good try and keep up dunlevy he challenged as he leapt on his broom and shot into the sky he grinned as he heard her indignant shout and began an intricate series of maneuvers for her to copy he was in his element and once again appreciated the good fortune that she shared his love of flying they were rather well matched both chasers and their late night clandestine flying sessions had certainly improved both their games lately however these sessions had changed they seemed less like a competition and more like a dance as the two became accustomed to each other moves and began to fly in synchrony rather than in mimicry that was what was happening now she had anticipated his actions and caught up to him so they moved together through the sky he wondered what it would be like to hold her in his arms and twirl her around a dance floor he pulled to a stop and smiled at her the cool air was tingeing her cheeks and nose pink and her breath came out in little puffs of steam he thought she looked completely utterly achingly beautiful that felt like dancing she laughed he looked at her in amazement i was just thinking that she leaned over and tapped his forehead you know what they say blackie great minds think alike do you dance he wondered she snorted really blackie i come from a fine wizarding family as you well know which means i was forced to go to all the classes on the social graces that you attended in your childhood but that doesntmean that you can dance he retorted you could have two left feet somehow he doubted it though she smirked at him i guess you will have to wait and see that could certainly be a way to occupy our evenings once it grows too cold to fly he cocked an eyebrow at her are you implying miss dunlevy that you want to spend more of your evenings with me goodness mr black you must be very thick headed if you haventfigured that out by now i may be thick headed but i can out fly you any time i want oh yeah yeah and he was off with her right on his tail and so the flirtation continued for quite some time until sirius saw the telltale glow on the horizon that indicated the imminent moonrise he signaled her to land he wanted her in his arms for this she climbed onto his broom and settled herself in front of him comfortably leaning her head onto his shoulder and tucking the cloak snugly around her he reached his hands around her and kicked off the ground slowly they glided to their spot above the lake and watched the moon rise above the hills to spill liquid silver onto the lake water below from his vantage point just behind and to her right he could see the corner of her lips turn up in delight he leaned forward to speak in her ear you look beautiful tonight rinna she blushed and as she turned her head to him his lips brushed her cheek she shivered as the biting breeze blew across her exertion heated face sirius used one hand to lift the hood of her cloak and placed it over her head he did the same with his own and then tucked her head under his chin as he pressed her close to him she closed her eyes and reveled in his warmth look he whispered and she opened her eyes to see the giant squid making ripples in the water the smooth sheet of liquid moonlight was shattered into a myriad of sparkling shards that winked below them she sighed sirius she said softly he jerked his head from the lake below to look at her yes rinna he answered breathlessly she smiled i cantthink of any place else i d rather be right now than here with you rinna pulled the letter from sirius out from her cloak and turned it over she compared the drawing to the view in front of her he remembered it remarkably well turning it over once more she re read his letter i wonder if it is as beautiful as i remember it she closed her eyes and felt a hollow ache in her chest no sirius it is not not without you here with me she stared out over the lake for a long time pondering the words of his letter he was still in too much danger and how long could he go on this way he wasntgetting proper rest or proper nutrition she d wager the constant stress of hiding and running must certainly be taking its toll on him by now she hated to think of the conditions he was living in if anyone had enjoyed the little niceties that moderate wealth could afford it had been sirius black fortunately he had found favor with one of his uncles who d left him a sizeable inheritance which became his only source of money once he was disinherited from the house of black she smiled at the memory of his penchant for expensive egyptian cotton sheets and goose down comforters and the man had dressed well not in the snobby way of most purebloods but his clothing had been of the finest quality albeit more often than not artfully untucked and casual he had always looked good but never like he d put any effort into his appearance he could look good again she thought if he was in the proper circumstances as in not on the lam properly fed decently clothed and clean shaven if someone just gave him a little tender loving care she stopped her thoughts in their tracks there was really no point in letting her mind drift any farther into that fantasy she was here way up north at hogwarts now and besides it not like she could harbor a fugitive in her quarters or anything but she could provide a place for him at her house he and remus would be good for each other remus could keep him out of trouble and sirius could keep remus company on the full moon she was sure remus wouldntobject and in fact he d probably enjoy thumbing his nose at the ministry in this way a grin of satisfaction began to trace itself across her face this was perfect she made up her mind that this saturday she would go home and ask remus to find sirius and give him a room at her house the shaggy large dog lay curled up under a bush in the park watching people pass by with interest finally he caught a familiar scent and his ears pricked up a tall sandy haired man was walking toward him a bag of groceries in one arm the man whistled and called softly where are you boy and patted his leg the dog pulled himself up with a long stretch of his back legs and let out a gentle woof ah there you are been waiting long the dog cocked his head tongue lolling in a canine grin causing the man to smile sorry about that i needed to stock up on victuals the dog barked his approval and settled in a trot by the man left leg remus lupin smiled and continued his one way conversation as the two walked i was glad to get your letter padfoot i was concerned when i hadntheard from you and i always wonder if my letters will reach you apparently the last one did he shifted the bag to his other arm i take it you have heard nothing else on that so called lead the dog next to him growled they had entered a little neighborhood we re almost there old friend you are welcome to stay i think i will be able to convince the landlady to allow me to keep a mangy old mutt here remus grinned at his private joke they ambled up the stoop of a cozy house and remus took down the wards and unlocked the door remus walked to the kitchen to put the groceries on the counter and noted the dog did not follow he stepped back out into the living room and found sirius black looking bedraggled and peering around the room with interest sirius turned to him and said evenly this is rinna house isntit remus nodded she convinced me to stay here and take care of the place while she at hogwarts he explained he took sirius arm and led him to the kitchen sitting him at the table remus put away food as he continued she needed a caretaker and i needed a place to stay so here i am the steward of the manor moony does she know i here sirius asked suspiciously well not exactly but we ll convince her that it is a good idea remus said with confidence sirius lifted an eyebrow at his old friend and how precisely are we going to persuade your landlady of that remus opened his arms wide why with marauder charm of course and a little fast talking in the form of an owl that will go out tomorrow morning he grinned a charming smile mischief flashing in his eyes she wontbe able to resist the two of us we ll bowl her over with our brilliant arguments sirius looked skeptical right and just what are our brilliant arguments exactly dinner first details later remus declared firmly as he set a pot on the stove to boil something about skipping meals involuntarily makes a man appreciate good home cooked food reflected sirius after dinner as he watched remus place some parchment and a quill on the table unfortunately he was now so tired that he was unable to focus on what remus was saying moony i afraid i knackered and i not much help you are going to have to mastermind this little plot of yours on your own sorry of course said remus immediately contrite i should have realized here let me show you to your room he took sirius down the hall to the first guest room which had a bath adjoining to the room remus was using sleep yourself out padfoot tomorrow is saturday and i donthave to work so once i take the letter to the owl post i plan on relaxing here until you wake thanks mate sirius yawned hugely i appreciate this you know i know what it is like to be homeless sirius remus said softly he made to leave but turned back at the door and by the way dontuse the shower in the bath here the drain is clogged and i haventhad a chance to magic it clear yet you ll need to use the one in the master bath sirius raised an eyebrow at that but merely shrugged and said right he kicked off his shoes and fell onto the bed asleep before his head hit the pillow saturday dawned over hogwarts clear and beautiful with the cool morning air hinting that the warmth of summer would soon give way to autumn unfortunately professor dunlevy missed it by several hours she pulled herself from her bed with a groan and realized that it was going to take more than a few days at school to rid her of her late morning tendencies with a jolt she remembered her resolution from the night on the lake and began to ready herself in a frenzy rinna stepped out of the fireplace into her living room and sensed that the house was locked and warded from the outside damn remus has left already annoyed that she had missed him she moved across the living room to the small antique desk in the corner intent on writing him a note explaining her mad plan as she searched for a working ball pen she became aware of a sound encroaching on her consciousness is that water running she began to follow the sound moving down the hallway toward her bedroom it was coming from her shower a fact she confirmed as she stepped into her room of course she d forgotten to tell remus about the faulty drain in the guest bathroom and he was probably using the other shower until he could get it fixed no wait if the house is warded from the outside only remus or i can do that he must be gone and if that was the case then who was in her shower in a flash her wand was in her hand she crept from her bedroom into the steamy bathroom she heard the running water and sounds of splashing coming from behind the plastic curtain in the alcove of her walk in shower even though common sense told her that none of the wards to her house had been disturbed a prickling sixth sense told her this was definitely not remus in her shower she held out her wand and stepped to the alcove she pushed her wand into the curtain indenting it as she went and said in a low and dangerous voice dontmove the figure behind the curtain froze for a moment before whipping the shower curtain aside obstructing her wand arm by entangling it as he did so rinna reacted swiftly by grabbing his throat with her other hand even as she freed her wand she felt the intruder lose his balance as he slipped on the slick tiles so rinna moved and allowed the intruder momentum to carry him further forward as he pitched out of the shower he grabbed her arm in an attempt to right himself but it was too late rinna was pulled down with the stranger and landed on the floor on top of him she wrenched her wand free and placed it at his throat even as she registered who he was startled blue eyes peered into wide green ones that were mere inches away as the two of them took several long seconds to comprehend their predicament bloody effing hell sirius what are you doing she screamed at him as she moved the wand tip away from his neck slightly a cocky grin spread across sirius face as he lifted his head from the floor and glanced down to appraise the situation well he drawled as he looked back up into her eyes at the moment having about four or five of my wildest fantasies fulfilled as rinna looked down she realized that she was straddling sirius straddling a very naked sirius a very naked and wet sirius she gulped as she realized she was spending far more time looking down at him than propriety allowed so she quickly returned to his face he was grinning at her the naked prat a sexy quirky grin that no man who d been discovered uninvited and naked in someone home should have the right to wear the word naked seemed to be reverberating through her head and somehow she had suddenly seemed to develop a rather heightened awareness of sirius lack of clothing and the water droplets that clung glistening to his naked er unclothed body the pain of landing and knocking his head on the bathroom floor had long since faded replaced with the warmth of the woman of his dreams lying on top of him in a very intimate manner although he knew he was damned lucky he hadntbeen hexed into next tuesday he couldnthelp but grin at the hilarity of the situation he and rinna had found themselves in and when he realized that she was not making any move to get off of him his grin grew even cockier rinna noted their faces were still very close his warm breath brushing against her lips and a strange paralysis seized her making it impossible for her to get up from him she couldntseem to look away from his eyes eyes the color of the sea in some tropical paradise droplets still clinging to his lashes she was drowning in the ocean of his blue blue eyes sirius reached a hand up and brushed his fingertips gently across her brow and down her cheek all right black surely you haventforgotten what to do when your woman is draped on top of you and is making no effort to remove herself from the situation the grin on his face softened as he held her gaze and coaxingly pulled her chin toward his mouth rinna i ve missed you he breathed and then their lips met author note when ron is describing moody demonstration of the avada kedavra his quote is directly from jkr harry potter and the goblet of fire chapter 14 the unforgivable curses talk about your long chapters well you know a lot happens in your first week back at school i sure would love to hear from you about what you thought of this chapter especially those who have been clamoring for more sirius damn it not naming any names cough kerichi cough i thank all the wonderful people who left reviews for my last chapter sj cat blckamthyststar coryna kerichi and kez extra hugs and kisses to you and of course big ups to my wonderful beta lorett if it wasntfor her you wouldnthave gotten a glimpse of rinna and naked sirius on the bathroom floor until next chapter 21 a new definition of family chapter 16 lions and snakes disclaimer i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe if i did i d probably be writing this from my vacation home in hawaii while getting a massage while alan rickman reads poetry to me in his snape voice sigh any characters places situations or spells that you dontfind in her fabulous books well now they belong to me sensations exploded like fireworks in rinna brain disrupting all rational thought one second her mind had been attempting to warn her about something what was it happening too fast and the next moment all the voice in her head could say was oh my stars warm pressure against her lips a hand slipping into her hair at the base of her neck another hand traveling up her spine between her shoulder blades it all felt so unbelievably right so wonderfully sweet like candy floss melting on her tongue dissolving away the reservations lurking in the back of her mind she found herself returning the kiss ardently hungrily not minding his facial hair and rather enjoying the sensations of his lips moving on hers and his hands running through her hair and over her back sirius heart jumped frantically in his chest when he felt rinna respond to the kiss and when she fisted her hands in his hair well he thought he might just black out from the sensations being generated from head to toe considering he had spent more than a decade in isolation bereft of human touch for so long all the tactile input he was now experiencing was intoxicating almost overwhelming and amazing so intent was she in continuing this pleasurable activity and so purposeful was she at ignoring the little warning thought scrabbling in her mind that rinna missed the subtle shift in magic as the wards surrounding her house were lowered remus entered the house noting how quiet it was sirius must really be sleeping himself out he thought as he ambled to the guest room to check on his friend the bed was empty remus frowned and listened for sounds of activity maybe he taking a shower there was no sound of running water growing concerned remus made his way up the hallway to the master bedroom sirius where are you mate the sound of remus voice pierced the desire induced haze in rinna head she placed her palms on the floor on either side of sirius head and wrenched herself away from him staring down at him with wild eyes sweet mother of morganna you haventeven had a rational conversation with this man in thirteen years and you are snogging him like a lovesick schoolgirl on your bathroom floor while he starkers what in the hell are you thinking sirius remus voice was coming closer green and blue eyes stared at each other wide in panic at nearly being caught and for a millisecond the two of them remained frozen on the floor then rinna scrambled off of sirius with alacrity grabbed a towel from the cabinet and threw it at him as she hastily exited into the bedroom siri remus entered the master bedroom and did not find the person he was expecting there us oh great bleeding hell rinna stopped crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow dauntingly indeed she replied archly what are you doing here whoops wrong thing to say lupin rinna stood with her hands on her hips and her eyes snapping a rather vexed expression on her face last time i checked this was my house you were expecting someone else it had been a while since remus lupin had had to think this fast on his feet he had to figure out how much she knew look rinna i can explain hang on why is your shirt all wet rinna face turned crimson i was i fell gah stop trying to change the subject remus i suggest you enlighten me as to why i came home to find an escapee the wizarding world most wanted man i might add showering in my bathroom so she found sirius in the shower and her clothing is rather damp this is interesting remus eyebrows raised and he suppressed a smile well you see rinna he said ingenuously the shower drain in the guest bath is clogged sirius entered from the bathroom amazed at remus audacity had the man forgotten that rinna was no slouch at wandless hexes right then i believe i need to scrounge a change of clothes moony rinna turned and saw said wanted man towel wrapped around his waist looking amused her gaze snapped back to remus as he turned to comply with the request hold it right there both of you rinna barked in a tone that brooked no argument you have some explaining to do and if there ever was a time to pour on that marauder charm this is it remus turned back to her and put on his best marauder smile certainly shall we all sit here on the bed he glanced at sirius you dontmind having this discussion dressed only in a towel do you padfoot sirius pretended to look thoughtful well moony it does put me at a distinct disadvantage he brightened we could level the playing field though i ll just go get two more towels he made like he was going to step back into the bathroom rinna let loose a rather exasperated snort and rolled her eyes fine i ll be in the kitchen she smirked hexing er i mean fixing some tea her words dangled ominously for a moment before she stalked to the bedroom door as she passed remus she said and i said marauder charm not marauder smarm you dolt as she moved down the hall she heard sirius quip you used to say there was no difference you know rinna had set out the cups poured out the tea and had just placed the teapot on the table when the two men walked into the kitchen she smirked inwardly at their tactical stance side by side shoulders touching their most captivating smiles in place clearly they felt that she had the upper hand in the situation she was flattered after all they had the advantage of numbers was she really that formidable she hoped so she pulled out a chair and sat down arms crossed looking from one man to the other you may begin the song and dance now she suggested with an arched brow again she appreciated their strategy they split up and one sat on either side of her she would not be able to fix both of them with a withering glare or a well placed hex at the same time hang on why am i thinking of this in terms of a battle we are on the same side after all they just dontknow it yet rinna kept a cool impassive expression on her face as she listened politely to remus rather smooth account remus was thankful that he d already written it out in the owl he d sent her because the story rolled off his tongue with ease now he explained how he d gotten a letter from sirius detailing the danger he d been in and wrote back asking sirius to return to london promising to help find him someplace safe to stay and lay low remus had been intending to write rinna and request she allow him to harbor sirius but his first week at his new job had been rather hectic and he d had no time to owl her nor did he know if sirius had actually gotten his letter and when or if he d even show up he d walked through the park he d told his friend to meet him in at the end of each workday in hopes of meeting him which finally happened last night the owl went to rinna this morning rinna took in a deep breath when remus had ended so how long exactly have you been planning this little conspiracy of yours she asked remus glanced at sirius trying to determine if the other man could gauge rinna reaction at all sirius shook his head with a small frown remus was full of misgivings now he d been sure that his glib explanation and the absolute sense of the plan would sway rinna to their cause well since the evening after you left for hogwarts actually he said uneasily both men were startled when rinna brought her hand down on the table with a loud smack damn it remus she cried i cantbelieve you came up with this before i did i thought i was absolutely brilliant the other night when this very scheme popped into my head remus and sirius appeared rather gobsmacked as she looked from one to the other a wily smile creeping across her face and when i come here to divulge my incredible plan i find that not only have the two of you already come up with it but you ve executed it as well you ve taken the wind right out of my sails sirius recovered first he let out a bark of laughter remus continued to stare at rinna shaking his head slightly as if he were trying to sort out his thoughts you you you conniving witch you let us believe you were upset remus spluttered oh remy dontyou remember toying with you marauders has always given me such pleasure her eyes glinted mischievously over the rim of her teacup besides it fair payback for the cheek you two gave me earlier in my room remus narrowed his eyes and frowned at her and sipped his tea while he regained his composure it didnttake long before he joined in the chuckling of his tablemates sirius had stayed out of the conversation until now recognizing that it was between rinna and remus and their original agreement of use of the house rinna he said with concern are you sure you dontmind me staying here you are technically breaking the law and probably jeopardizing your new job she regarded him solemnly i want to help you stay safe until your name is cleared i ve been very worried about you sirius he felt a twinge in his chest at her words and smiled if she was worried about him that meant that she cared remus cleared his throat as he felt a subtle shift in the atmosphere in the kitchen well i see that my work here is done he pushed back his chair and stood up i ll just leave you two now i sure you have a lot to uh discuss remus beat a hasty retreat out of the kitchen and an awkward silence descended on the two remaining occupants a very tense awkward silence rinna hadntreally considered that if she provided sirius a place to stay she would as a matter of course have to engage in some kind of interaction with him she hadntconsidered that had she she became uncomfortably aware that somewhere deep in her mind she had not only considered it but had been gleeful at the thought face it rinna you didntcome up with this plan just to be kind to a man unjustly accused and the victim of a miscarriage of justice you wanted to have an excuse to see him again her musings were interrupted can i assume by your response just now that you re not averse to feeling things for me anymore his voice was earnest and sincere but held a trace of cockiness engendered by recently having a woman he found very attractive return his kiss wholeheartedly her lips quirked a bit i ve spent the last few weeks processing my feelings as dorrie calls it it a muggle term she sighed and added quietly your roses had the intended effect i think she smiled fondly they called to mind some very good feelings the silence descended again but not quite so strained this time sirius looked at her as she stared into her teacup she looked good she had obviously kept herself fit certainly not the skinny girl from school a tendency toward overwork hours of quidditch practice and a habit of letting off steam through physical exercise had contributed to that and later when she was working for the order she often didnteat out of nerves but now she seemed somehow softer he saw her look at him and he dropped his eyes to the table he wondered what she was seeing he knew that he was now skinny atrophied of muscle and he had become all hard lines and angles what would she find attractive about him now he d been an idiot for being so forward with her back there in the lavatory sure she d been surprised swept away in the moment as he had been but was that what she had really wanted sirius took a deep breath i sorry about what happened in the bathroom well not sorry exactly he saw her cheeks turn a little pink because it was a ruddy brilliant snog and her face flushed a deeper shade but i shouldnthave kissed you not without having a clear idea on whether or not you want to give this a go rinna wrapped her hands around her teacup and once again stared at the amber liquid and sighed you talk about giving this a go like it is just some simple thing like there is no painful history between us you dontknow me anymore you dontknow if this is even a good idea we need to talk first isntthat what we are doing right now i for one do think this is a good idea look at what just happened in there rinna you cannot deny that we still have incredible chemistry but is incredible chemistry enough to assuage the hurts of the past sirius his eyes were smoldering conveying not just carnal desire but a hopeful yearning as well those cerulean eyes tugged at her heart she had to close her own against them the past doesntmatter anymore rinna sirius said firmly taking her hand in his but it did yet what mattered more was being honest with him now for she had suffered a harsh lesson when she had concealed the truth from him before if she had been forthright then everything might have turned out so differently she had to speak sirius had the right to know the truth about the woman he thought he wanted without opening her eyes for she knew if she looked into his amazing blue eyes now she would lose all nerve she spoke i need to tell you something first about the ten years i spent away sirius did not let go of her hand remus told me somewhat about it when i first returned he began remus does not know all of it sirius rinna interrupted a bit sharply she opened her eyes now and studied his face she saw concern longing and apprehension her resolve wavered for just a moment fear that he would turn away when he heard her confession gripped her for one split second and then it passed she knew that she must say it now even if it meant losing him she gently pulled her hand from his i probably closer to the person you thought i d become than the girl you knew rinna said resignedly sirius looked at her perplexed what do you mean i spent much of my ten years abroad studying ancient and dark magic one doesntspend that much time immersed in it without it tainting one soul in some way what are you telling me rinna that you ve practiced dark arts sirius voice was thick with trepidation rinna laughed cynically not to worry sirius i haventturned into one of those girls your mum would have been ecstatic to have you bring home she gave him a sardonic little half grin he gave her a measuring look well aware that she had not directly answered his question but was her answer sufficient you ve got to start trusting her again sometime he filled his lungs then released the air through his mouth you never kept secret from me the darkness you harbored inside he said in a low voice nor did i from you even when such secrets could have torn us apart she nodded i could tell you anything because i knew you were a child marked by shadows like me she murmured but it didnttear us apart rinna it made us stronger and now it is obvious that we both conceal more darkness than before he appropriated her attention with his blazing eyes unable to bear the intensity of his look any longer rinna dropped her gaze to her lap you or i could let that prevent us from having any kind of relationship again or he trailed off the silence was pregnant with implications finally rinna looked back up why sirius why do you want to have anything to do with me rinna every day i was in azkaban he stopped and ran his hand through his hair making her heart ache at the familiarity of the gesture not a day went by that i didntthink of you she studied him keenly i can imagine what kind of thoughts they must have been then what are you saying come on sirius any feelings or thoughts you had of me must have been tinged with less than favorable emotions or the dementors would have stripped them from you sirius got up and paced agitatedly around the kitchen do you know how i survived there how i kept from going insane in that place he asked vehemently he turned to look at rinna do you his voice grew louder her eyes were wide with consternation tell me she whispered as she stood and backed up to the counter three things saved me rinna he held three fingers up in emphasis the first was maintaining my animagus form most of the time the second was the knowledge that i was innocent and unjustly imprisoned he snorted not exactly a happy thought that so the dementors were kept at bay he glanced at her he saw sadness and horror written on her face and the third she asked her voice soft and breaking sirius let out a sigh and ran his hands through his hair again the third was the fear that maybe you had told me the truth that day and that you really didntlove me he heard her sharp intake of breath i think that was really the main thing that kept me sane thinking about you over and over and alternating between anger and despair over you it made me strong it made me determined to survive so i could someday find out the truth he looked at her with haunted eyes that i had betrayed you she whispered tears running down her cheeks he crossed to her and stood very close i d hoped to find that you hadntstopped loving me he said simply he held her gaze searching for the answer he was looking for in the depths of her eyes rinna could not look away she wanted more than anything to rush into his arms and hold him and tell him that she hadn t she hadntstopped loving him but she knew that in all fairness there were things she needed to say things he needed to hear before she could tell him that she quickly dashed the tears from her face you say that your memories and thoughts of me kept you sane she said softly trying to keep her look impassive he nodded it was thoughts of you of what i d thought i d done to you that drove me mad that sent me to st mungo s rinna sirius voice cracked how do we get over something like this she asked him desperately can we even sirius reached for her hand and said very gravely i dontknow but by all that is holy rinna i sure want to try rinna breath caught in her throat and she closed her eyes as if she couldntquite believe what she heard sirius tugged at her hand and tentatively pulled her in toward him his heart soared when she stepped forward at his invitation and he took her and tucked her in to his chest her head under his chin and tenderly wrapped his arms around her rinna sighed as her hands encircled his waist wrists crossing at the small of his back she pressed her cheek against his chest and became aware of the sound of his heart rinna felt an odd almost painful catch under her ribs as if her heart somehow sensing that it was off rhythm had momentarily paused and then it began beating again this time in a new tempo that felt right and filled her being with life and hope her mind which for years had been at odds with her heart could no longer remain silent in the midst of all this he is my weakness plain and simple and here he is again and for now she realized she wanted to be weak she yearned to give in to what they both wanted because although he was her weakness his love had been those years ago what had made her strong give in let him back in stop the hurting learn to trust him again you need him let him in blackie she breathed against his heart i want to try too sirius arms tightened around her in reaction to her words she clasped him tightly in return before she pulled away slightly to tilt her head and look up at him his hands framed her face as he studied it he memorized it and imposed the images over the recollections of her face as a girl and as a young woman she hadntchanged much there were a few lines crinkled at the corners of her eyes and near the edges of her mouth he touched her hair and trailed one hand along her jaw line as he looked into her eyes he knew she would see the same things in his that he saw in hers pain tragedy despair and yet he saw something flicker in the verdant depths of her eyes something that had been missing at their other encounters and it grew like a flame spreading out on a log licking away at the sadness and damage hope his thumb caressed her chin and she lifted it up just as he lowered his head he heard her breath hitch as his lips ghosted over hers sensing her warmth feeling her mouth move as she whispered i have never stopped loving you ruby his voice was choked with emotion and his words would not come out demonstration would have to suffice to communicate the effect her declaration had on him he pulled her chin toward him as his other hand hooked around her waist and drew her body against his then he kissed her tenderly lovingly longingly until the ache in his chest dissolved away replaced by the knowledge she loves me remus looked up from his book as sirius crossed the back porch to throw himself onto a chaise lounge tucking his arms behind his head before letting out a long self satisfied sigh so i take it from your smug expression that you ve brought her around to your way of thinking then remus asked his friend sirius smacked his lips i d say she is definitely coming around then why arentyou in there right now remus wanted to know she had to go she only planned on stopping by here on her way to diagon alley she said she had to get some potions ingredients and she has afternoon patrol at the school remus nodded ah the joys of being the new teacher always getting the crummiest assignments so when are you going to see each other again remus was amused to see a goofy smile take over sirius face dunno she going to owl me says she can probably get an afternoon off next weekend sirius rolled onto his side and propped his head on his elbow you know moony it strange one day you feel like things cantpossibly get any worse that nothing is going your way and then the next everything shifts all because of a woman remus chuckled i glad you have a new perspective padfoot he returned to his book and sirius returned to his supine position after about a minute remus shut his book in exasperation i cantbelieve you are making me ask ask what was the innocent reply are you going to tell me what happened there in the shower or not sirius grinned why moony i thought you d never ask the next few weeks passed rather quickly as everyone settled into the school year and the fourth years found that their homework loads had certainly gotten heavier this term the only one who seemed to take that well was hermione and when she wasntdevoting her time to her studies she was bestowing it on her new project house elf rights harry and ron found they saw less and less of her and were rather frustrated with the situation they decided to seek help excuse me professor dunlevy rinna looked up from her desk where she was grading papers during the midmorning break she smiled at the two students who had entered her classroom and immediately put down her quill pushing the stack of essays to the side hullo ron harry what can i do for you ron said do you have a minute we need to talk to you the seriousness in his voice caused rinna some concern it about hermione harry added she got up from her desk at once and gestured to them follow me she led them to her office in the back of the classroom and pulled up chairs for them she leaned herself against the front of a very heavy oak desk and quickly cast a silencing charm on the door tell me what going on lads ron and harry who were looking with interest at the shelves and desk in her office turned to look at each other before regarding rinna she gone round the twist with this spew stuff ron began spew stuff rinna asked in confusion house elf rights harry explained s p e w stands for society for the promotion of elfish welfare she thinks house elves should be paid and have representation in the ministry of magic ah right rinna had overheard something about hermione new cause from fred george and lee complaining before class about her cornering them with her collection tin and badges demanding they join harry continued she spending all of her free time in the library or else she waving her badges in people faces and trying to browbeat them into joining up she making a lot of the students upset especially in gryffindor ron looked at rinna earnestly we want you uh that is we were hoping you would tell her to stop rinna was silent for a moment studying the two young men why she asked ron started well because we ve tried to but she wontlisten to us rinna interrupted no i meant why should she stop is she harming anyone both boys shook their heads no said harry thoughtfully but she sure isntmaking any friends and you say you ve tried talking to her yeah we have harry explained and she just gets upset with us if we dontagree to wear the badges or get other people to join and we hardly ever get to see her anymore right ron agreed she never around to help us with our homework anymore uh he glanced a rinna in alarm i mean you know check it over for us and goad us to finish it on time and stuff of course that what you meant rinna agreed with an ironic lift of her eyebrows but it more than that she never around period i i miss her harry shoulders slumped a little he would never admit it to ron and most likely not to his godmother but he d been missing more than hermione company terribly and was a little hurt that she was devoting so much time to her new cause he was also feeling rather guilty for without hermione around he found his eyes wandering around the great hall more during meals now and they often found rest on ravenclaw pretty seeker cho chang rinna huffed out a breath i sorry lads i not going to tell her she has to stop but i will she added holding up her hands to forestall their simultaneous groans of disappointment go and talk to her will that suffice harry and ron looked at each other and smiled in relief brilliant said ron you ll be able to tell if she gone mad besides she ll listen to you you re a teacher about half an hour before curfew professor dunlevy entered the library and whispered quietly to madame pince the librarian indicated one of the study tables in the back near the restricted section rinna smiled her thanks and walked to the indicated table she was amused at the irony that hermione had chosen one of rinna preferred tables for quiet study what was it that james used to say swotty minds think alike hullo hermione rinna slipped into an empty chair next to the girl hermione looked up annoyance at the disturbance showing in her eyes good evening professor dunlevy she said stiffly goodness she doesntlike me very much does she i here because harry and ron told me they were worried about you i think they are feeling a little abandoned she indicated the books and scrolls and s p e w badges that littered the table what hermione was incensed they are the ones who abandoned me they wonthelp me with any of this why not rinna wondered the brown haired girl scowled and crossed her arms defiantly they dontthink that what i am doing is important she huffed ah rinna leaned back in the chair nodding thoughtfully tell me why you think it is important because house elves have been enslaved for centuries centuries and no one seems to think it is wrong ron and the twins tried to tell me that the house elves like it that ridiculous no one likes slavery and they are abused treated like property forced to do things or go places they dontlike they dontget paid they are required to injure themselves as punishment it beastly after going on a good deal longer about the importance of s p e w hermione finally looked at the professor sitting next to her seeing the neutral polite expression on rinna face she spluttered you dontagree with me do you you are a pureblood you probably think my cause is utterly stupid just like ron and harry hermione rinna held up her hands in a calming gesture hermione i can see that you perceive that an injustice is being done i can see that you believe very strongly that there is something you can do about it and i see you acting on that conviction whether or not i believe that your cause has merit is not the point here she picked up one of the s p e w badges and rubbed her fingers meditatively on its surface then she pierced hermione with her gaze the world needs people like you in it hermione granger people who will point out injustice people who will act when no one else seems willing to people who take their convictions and do something with them i applaud you for what you are doing oh hermione was very taken aback so you re not going to tell me that i should give this whole thing up ha i d rather roll around in a pen full of blast ended skrewts rinna chuckled hermione considered this in silence for a few moments then why are you here she queried confused rinna smiled gently i here because harry and ron asked me to come they told me they miss you and because i promised them that i would talk to you and make sure that you werentbarking mad hermione laughed a little at that they care about you very much you know frizzy brown hair bobbed as she nodded her head i know hermione said softly an indulgent smile on her face the smile quickly turned sly as she added and they are probably getting woefully behind on their homework i imagine rinna laughed knowingly but quickly quieted when she heard madame pince pointedly clearing her throat behind them she glanced at the library clock and said come on i ll walk you back to the gryffindor common room so you wontget in trouble for being out after curfew she helped the girl put away books and clean up the table the teacher and the student walked quietly through the halls at the portrait of the fat lady rinna held out the s p e w badge she had been holding all that time would you mind if i kept this she asked hermione head whipped up in surprise ah all right rinna did not miss the calculating glint in her eyes i not allowed to wear it staff dress code you know oh disappointment was evident in hermione voice having a teacher wearing the badge would have been an absolute coup for her cause rinna smiled admiration for the girl persistence and ambition growing by the minute she d have done well in slytherin she thought but i will keep it at my desk hermione smiled excellent she declared it happened one rainy night towards the end of september that dinner in the middle section of the slytherin table was a quiet affair draco malfoy was sulking the school year was nearly one month gone and draco was heartily getting tired of the whispered slander and outright spoken taunts of the fourth year gryffindors he ground his teeth and mentally blasted mad eye moody for ever transfiguring him into a ferret he felt particularly irritated by the insults from potty and the weasel mostly because draco had yet to find a suitable comeback that would push the right buttons he did not dare trot out any derogatory remarks about the weasley matriarch again now granger and her new house elf campaign gave him plenty of fodder and he d come up with some rather nasty slurs if he did say so himself but the bushy haired bint had taken to just tossing him a sneer of contempt and then ignoring him he couldntget a rise out of her it was galling especially when he remembered the smack in the face she d given him last year what he wouldntgive to elicit that kind of response from her again as it was the situation was intolerable he d reached his limit if those filthy gryffindors any of them made one more reference to ferrets well there d be hell to pay he grinned evilly causing his cadre of third and fourth year sycophants to shudder it also happened that night that hogwarts third and fourth years were busy working on a joint transfiguration project in the library at about fifteen minutes before curfew madame pince began shooing everyone out a group of about sixteen slytherins and a little more than a dozen gryffindors remained until madam pince demanded that they please vacate the premises immediately draco malfoy found his exit blocked by bushy brown hair out of my way mudblood he hissed elbowing hermione aside oy malfoy you git ron shouted to the slytherin retreating back learn some manners draco turned with a smirk and said oh that rich coming from a destitute uncouth slob like you weasel harry placed a restraining hand on ron chest he sneered at the blond boy what are you trying to transfigure your pincushion into malfoy a ferret it should be easy for you draco froze and so did his housemates around him harry and ron laughed along with the other gryffindors and they turned to make their way to their dorm draco didntmove as he watched them leave a petulant scowl on his face shouldntwe go to the dungeons draco asked vincent crabbe draco held up a hand to forestall any more inquires when the last gryffindor was out of sight he whispered follow them the corridor that ran from the library to the stairs to gryffindor tower had several places where it widened out so much that it was like a small courtyard or antechamber this was to accommodate a side hallway or two it was in one such spot that the slytherins caught up to the group potter draco bellowed instantly harry and his group spun around to see the slytherins arranging themselves at one end of the hall wands drawn what do you want malfoy harry gritted out the gryffindors immediately took defensive stances wands at the ready draco took a menacing step forward you have called me ferret for the last time potter a cocky smirk took over harry face his eyes alight with glee oh really have i now what are you going to do about it fer rr ret draco eyes narrowed with indignation as he raised his wand in response serpensortia he shouted and suddenly a large snake was weaving toward the gryffindors hissing angrily hermione grabbed harry arm no harry dontyou dare counter we ll all get in trouble for dueling in the halls but it was too late harry had yanked his arm free and his snake was quickly slithering forward to meet the other hermione mind was working furiously looking for a way to end this unfortunate encounter when two more slytherins stepped forward shouted the spell and two more snakes joined the fray we need the advantage she thought i wonder i wonder and in that millisecond she decided to employ the charm she d been using to make all her s p e w badges serpensortia accensere decem she cried ten snakes moved with zeal toward the slytherins and for a single moment everyone froze bloody hell hermione ron shouted breaking the stillness suddenly everyone erupted with curses hexes and blocking spells harry pansy parkinson and blaise zabini all picked up on hermione modification and soon thirty or more snakes had joined the melee it was quickly becoming very dangerous uh oh harry thought i think things just got very very out of hand rinna grimaced as she ran down the little used hallway trying to work her way back to the main part of the castle and to her quarters she would much rather run outdoors but the rain had never let up so she had to resort to jogging the hallways and climbing the stairs unfortunately several of the moving staircases had conspired to not only lengthen her workout but to dump her off into one of the lesser used areas of the castle many floors up her breath was ragged in her ears and she was tired which might have explained why she didnthear the strange hissing or sense the swirling of magical energy until seconds before she rounded the corner at full tilt damn it should have slowed down rinna stepped on a rather large serpent wrenching her right ankle and experienced one of those strange sensations of time slowing to a near stop as she fell to the floor and skidded right into a large writhing mass of perhaps dozens of snakes she had the presence of mind to shout a shielding charm that repelled the striking animals and gave her a perimeter of about two feet the students involved in the fracas stilled suddenly as a person burst out from the side hallway and stumbled into the scene literally several gasps were heard as she fell and harry heart leapt into his throat when he recognized his godmother as she landed among the reptiles with a shout holy hell it professor dunlevy exclaimed gregory goyle looking in consternation at draco but draco and his housemates horrified attention was riveted by what was happening the red headed woman had managed to get on hands and knees and was making the oddest hissing noises at the snakes that were raised up and ready to strike all around her harry watched his godmother with wide eyes as she carefully slowly painstakingly got her feet under her in a crouch the entire time speaking softly in a sweet voice very much at odds with the situation there there my beauties see i not going to hurt you come on now settle down there are my good laddies i not going to hurt you she slowly stood up keeping up the soft patter in a lilting voice that seemed to soothe the serpents and soon they were swaying to and fro in front of her once she had her balance evenly distributed on her feet she made a brusque cutting gesture and sharply uttered a banishment charm instantly all the snakes in the room vanished there was a collective gasp from the spectators and then everyone fell silent professor dunlevy eyes swept the hall as she stood breathing heavily assessing the situation she looked rather perturbed the students shuffled their feet nervously well she drawled sardonically as she crossed her arms would anyone care to enlighten me as to what was going on here her voice was calm unruffled and dangerously soft no one moved or made a sound harry doubted that anyone present would appreciate the honor of being the first students to arouse the ire of professor dunlevy no one had yet seen or heard of her losing her temper and the apprehension in the air was palpable only he and his friends had ever seen her in a fit of pique and based on that experience he was not looking forward to the next few minutes rinna drummed her fingers on her upper arm as she gave the group one more chance come on now i can see that this was more than just a meeting of the hogwarts herpetological society still there was no response she smirked she could appreciate the irony that these two groups were at least momentarily aligned in the solidarity of silence rinna extended both her hands in a grasping motion accio wands immediately every wand in the room went flying into her doubled grip tell me she said in a deceptively conversational tone have any of you heard of the spell prior incantato harry was horrified to see hermione hand shoot up she just canthelp herself can she he tried to pull it down but rinna had seen yes miss granger it is used to discover the most recent spell a wand has cast professor hermione answered quietly rinna suppressed a smile very good ten points to gryffindor she glanced again over the assembly let me explain how this scenario is going to go down each of you here that cast a curse or a hex will have an opportunity to step forward you will receive detention and lose ten points for your house everyone began shifting and muttering uneasily if you choose not to step forward i will proceed to cast prior incantato on your wand and if i discover that you were a perpetrator you will receive detention for a week and lose one hundred points for your house is this clear that unfair exclaimed draco you re blackmailing us into incriminating ourselves the professor cast him a mordant look no mr malfoy either way one culpability is exposed i am merely expediting the conclusion of our dealings here there are a large number of wands she lifted her hands for emphasis and it will take far longer than i want to go through them all besides haventyou heard that confession is good for the soul draco scowled at the aphorism harry took a deep breath no point in delaying the inevitable he thought he stepped forward and declared i cast a serpensortia and uh he turned to hermione what was the other one hermione serpensortia accensere decem she supplied professor dunlevy eyebrows raised in interest yeah that one and i cast that one too hermione hastily added stepping up to join harry as did i draco insisted as he moved up one by one students from each house moved forward and admitted to various spells until all that were left were neville longbottom from gryffindor and miriam baddock a slytherin third year all right you two am i to understand that you did not cast any hexes or curses during this little scuffle rinna looked at each of them not unkindly neville shuffled his feet uncomfortably i i i tried to ma am but all that came out of my wand was a spray of daisies he said with shame sure enough a trampled bouquet was evident in the corner several snickers were heard from the slytherin side of the hall longbottom is it rinna inquired neville nodded miserably well your well known talent in herbology would explain that professor sprout speaks very highly of you neville brightened and flushed from the praise you confessed to intent so the punishment still stands detention and ten points from gryffindor neville nodded she turned to the pretty but rather quiet slytherin girl and you miss baddock i i uh didntparticipate in the brawl ma am she hung her head knowing that she would be put upon by the others later for not only not trying to hex gryffindors but for confessing to her lack of contribution as well all right miss baddock if you would kindly take your wand rinna proffered the handful of wands and miriam carefully extracted hers rinna set the two bundles of wands down by her feet and reached behind her to remove her own wand from where it was tucked into the waistband of her track pants harry was startled to realize that up until this very moment his godmother had been using wandless magic rinna cast the prior incantato which revealed that the last spell miriam baddock had used was an acne banishing spell the poor girl flushed with embarrassment until the professor took her chin and turned it to each side to study miriam flawless complexion oh well done rinna exclaimed remarkably well executed miss baddock i wish i had had your skill with skin care spells when i was in school i would ve given anything to keep my face from breaking out into spots the girl smiled shyly at professor dunlevy who winked all right you lot rinna bent to pick up the remaining wands please come forward to claim your wands and then you are dismissed to your dorms oh and i suppose i should say something to the effect of i hope we ve all learned something here today i know that i have she smiled ruefully what did you learn blaise zabini asked cheekily as he retrieved his wand to slow down when i turning corners the gryffindors waited until the more pushy slytherins had taken their wands before moving forward harry was amazed to hear pansy parkinson say as she moved down the hall i learned that professor dunlevy is a parselmouth he saw rinna shoulders suddenly tense of course that why she was talking to the snakes rinna had almost completely relaxed as she reined in the whole situation until she picked up the bundles of wands again immediately she felt an odd prickling in one of her hands a sensation that she had noticed before but ignored she shrugged it off as nerves pansy comment only served to further her discomfiture but coming face to face with harry was her undoing she saw something flicker in his eyes accusation she knew why once again she had kept something from him but honestly could he blame her for not blithely telling people she spoke parseltongue it really wasntsomething you admitted to if you were trying to make a good impression and she d desperately been trying to make a good impression on harry for two months now all right harry she asked as he pulled his wand the last one from her hand he nodded did this all start perchance with an altercation between you three and malfoy she queried harry nodded again not meeting her eyes ah i sorry that you almost got bitten he said to her feet she sighed well it was fortunate that it was me that came around that corner and that i was able to talk my way out of some snake bites harry raised his eyes to her then and he realized that things could have turned out much much worse yeah you re right the blaze of indignation left his expression and a smile threatened to move his lips it a good thing it was you and not professor snape or we gryffindors would have made out a whole lot worse indeed she agreed well good night harry good night prof uh rinna she watched him join hermione and ron who were waiting for him where the hall narrowed again as the three disappeared leaving her alone she began to notice the ache in her right ankle the scrapes on her forearms where she d landed and that the weird prickling was no longer present in her hand well done came an encouraging voice and rinna spun around to see hogwarts headmaster emerge from the very corridor she d barreled onto the scene from just how much of that did you witness rinna demanded suspiciously he crossed toward her eyes glinting over his half moon spectacles he pointed his wand at her ankle and each of her elbows in turn as he spoke healing her injuries oh enough enough to know that the third and fourth year slytherins are now looking forward to taking your classes next term that hermione granger will need special tutoring to hone that natural talent for modifying spells she possesses that neville longbottom self esteem has risen a notch and that miriam baddock will soon have a wildly successful underground business selling skin care charms rinna let out an unladylike guffaw as i said well done except harry is now upset to find out that i a parselmouth rinna said regretfully dumbledore looked thoughtful perhaps he was merely surprised to discover that he is no longer the only one at hogwarts with that particular gift he said mildly rinna eyes goggled what dumbledore took her hand and patted it would you care to join me for a nightcap in my office my dear you know damn well i would after a comment like that albus it seemed to harry that everyone took forever to retire to bed when the trio was finally alone in the common room harry put down his quill and said in a low voice what do you make of rinna she makes bloody wandless magic look easy peasy doesntshe ron said i was referring to her speaking parseltongue harry amended dryly ron was puzzled what about it hermione huffed a little impatiently at ron i think harry is a bit concerned about this new information ronald at ron continued quizzical look she explained it usually only found among dark wizards remember oh i guess i ve gotten so used to harry being able to speak it that i forgot about that ron seemed deep in thought i dontthink you should be concerned about her she never given any indication that she into dark arts besides harry just proves that there can be exceptions to the rule you speak it but you re not a dark wizard harry ron pointed out yes but we know how i acquired my ability to speak parseltongue it is rather unlikely that rinna got that particular skill from voldemort like me well we know she a pureblood right hermione said didntsirius tell you that harry nodded she probably comes from a family with dark arts roots privately she agreed with ron rinna may be secretive but she wasntevil yeah ron agreed and sirius came from a very dark family himself and he okay harry visibly relaxed at ron comment you re right he mused and you know i really hated it when everyone was judging me and thinking i was the heir of slytherin when it came out that i was a parselmouth in fact i dontblame her keeping something like that hidden the others nodded so ron queried what was it she was saying to the snakes anyway later when harry was lying in bed and reviewing the whole incident in his head he realized that things really could have turned out so much worse on so many levels he sighed and resolved to put the quandary of rinna newly revealed ability out of his mind a n accensere decem really just means add ten in latin i made that up just like hermione i guess swotty minds do think alike hee hee i would love to hear what you think of this chapter as it was one of my favorites to write so hurry dontwait one second more and go to the review button below please please please tell me what you thought i begging you and muchas smooches to the wonderful people who reviewed my last chappie and made me dance about in glee lorett aka beta extraordinaire kerichi sj smokie abril coryna and kerrie the scary girl next door and thanks to tombadgerlock who reviewed chapter one i hope you are still reading 19 a new definition of family chapter 17 misbehavin disclaimer i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe sigh any characters places little shops in knockturn alley situations or spells that you dontfind in her fabulous books well now they belong to me author note if i were to use the motion picture association rating system for my story i would say that up until this point it would be a definite pg 13 mostly for language and the occasional romantic scene well our dear rinna and sirius have forced me to assign an r rating for this chapter at least for the last third of the chapter anyway rated r for how can i euphemistically put it ah yes for adult situations if you wouldntbe allowed into an r rated movie on your own you probably shouldntbe reading it you have been warned no skipping over to the last part of the chapter now you hear as it turned out the snake incident as it was being called by the hogwarts staff was the first of many episodes of misbehavior that began to crop up mischief and general bad behavior was at an all time high for so early in the term rinna had just broken up one such occurrence on her way to the staff meeting a group of sixth years she was not in the least bit surprised to find fred and george weasley and lee jordan the ringleaders had decided to create a skating rink in the main hall outside the charms classroom by flooding the area with water from the nearby boys lavatory and applying a impressively well executed freezing charm after handing out detentions to all involved rinna shooed away the hufflepuff and gryffindor girls who had been skating in their stocking feet first allowing them to dry their socks and turned to dispatch the gryffindor and ravenclaw boys who were using their care of magical creatures books in some sort of weird version of curling she was duly impressed with the level of creativity they had achieved they had even transfigured their quills into little brooms to sweep the ice in front of the books you three she commanded pointing at one dread locked and two ginger haired perpetrators demonstrate your magical skills by cleaning this up now while the boys were doing so madam hooch happened onto the scene and stood by rinna watching the proceedings with interest when the lads were done rinna sent them away with double detentions and a sincere well done all of it the two women began walking toward the staff room madam hooch said it wontbe long before these harmless pranks begin to get worse i hardly would call a hallway writhing with a hundred snakes harmless rinna noted dryly the flying instructor brushed her comment aside exactly what i mean pretty soon someone will get hurt badly it because of the cancellation of quidditch you know the students have no organized sanctioned outlet for their restless energy rinna agreed and added and we still have almost four weeks to go before the other schools arrive dontforget madam hooch paused would you agree that something must be done arinna her tone was conspiratorial what did you have in mind rolanda rinna grinned collaboratively the din of clamoring voices struck rinna and her companion as they opened the staff room door the last ones to arrive minerva mcgonagall eyes narrowed as she saw rinna hand hooch a quill and hastily roll up a scroll and shrink it into her palm professor sinistra had unofficially started the meeting her voice loud with concern it getting out of hand albus why minerva is having to assign each staff member a third and even fourth night of detention duty to accommodate all the punishments being handed out rinna politely cleared her throat and unfortunately i just gave out twenty six detentions and three doubles on my way over here what sprout flitwick and sinistra all rounded on her she shrugged apologetically the snake incident had awarded rinna the dubious honor of giving the most detentions for a single act of mischief so far this year twenty nine of them to be exact and now she had topped herself an ice skating rink outside the charms classrooms she explained sixth years she looked at mcgonagall and flitwick it really too bad you didntget to see it minerva filius because it was a brilliant display of skilled transfiguration and charms work but none of rinna colleagues were amused everyone turned to the headmaster and began talking at once sinistra protested her loss of personal time moody suggested this was all the work of dark wizards who had infiltrated the school and were controlling the students behavior with the imperius curse argus filch whined that if he was allowed to discipline the students his way this problem wouldntbe happening even snape calmly pointed out that additional nights of detention duty would disrupt his work on many of the delicate potions he was brewing especially the potions that poppy pomfrey relied on daily in the infirmary as other staff opened mouths to lodge their complaints dumbledore raised his hands for silence everyone quieted and found a seat except sybill trelawney who had actually ventured down from her tower to attend the meeting she quavered i knew great turmoil was on the horizon my inner eye foresaw these troubling times snape looked at her with an expression of sour distaste and yet you did not deem it troubling enough to enlighten the rest of the staff he noted acerbically trelawney glared at him and sat down huffily the headmaster cleared his throat i am aware that mischief and mayhem has reached unprecedented heights for so early in the term and our good deputy headmistress has informed me that we have enough detentions to last well into mid november if we use the normal detention duty roster he stopped and thanks to our sixth years probably to the end of november he chuckled to himself skating rinks in the hallways what will they think of next he was met with silence cheerfully he added and that is of course assuming that from this moment on no more students earn a detention the chances of that happening as i sure you are all aware are not very likely the man looked like he was thoroughly enjoying himself my my this is a most interesting situation yes rolanda i believe that most of our troubles are a result of pent up energy that has no properly approved physical outlet albus stated madam hooch after all in a normal school year the houses would have had at least three weeks of quidditch practice under their belts by now and would be zealously preparing for the first match of the year all of their restless energy would be channeled into flying strategizing or cheering with the canceling of quidditch the students are finding much more er creative ways to let off steam she looked around we simply must arrange for quidditch to be played voices again rose all at once someone cried we cantstart quidditch now the triwizard tournament is beginning soon others nodded in emphasis there is no time to have team try outs now shouted pomona sprout head of hufflepuff house quidditch is quite out of the question came another protest rinna popped out of her seat rather suddenly drawing the attention of the others who were all old enough that they never moved that abruptly anymore unless absolutely necessary with the exception of snape who was spry enough but would never deign to behave in so indecorous a manner may i suggest something she asked politely taking the disapproving silence as an affirmative she said i think we should seize this opportunity to enhance the students education we could start up an intramural program of muggle sports say rugby or maybe that crazy american football it would be very cross cultural you know promote understanding it would be a precursor to the triwizard tournament itself rinna wished she had a camera to capture the expressions of her colleagues as it was she had to stifle a snort she needed to be convincing after all severus snape looked as if he d just smelled something very unpleasant really arinna are you daft the idea of slytherin house playing muggle games is absolutely preposterous his voice trailed off as he noted an amused glint in rinna eyes and her attempt to hide a smug quirk of her lips he snapped his mouth shut and eyed her warily he had a sudden suspicion that he and the rest of the staff was in the process of being conned by the red headed upstart my dear said professor sprout in a tone that was a cross between pity and exasperation you of all people should know that quidditch is a time honored tradition here at hogwarts why it is the oldest wizarding sport and as such is hogwarts official sport heads began to nod again in agreement exactly professor sinistra interjected even in the spirit of cross cultural understanding it simply would be unseemly for this school to play host to muggle games she turned to dumbledore if there are to be any intramural games they must be quidditch the headmaster was stroking his beard to hide the smile on his lips he cleared his throat and said solemnly i have always tried to heed the good advice of my staff particularly when it comes to the well being of this school is this the general consensus that we should begin intramural quidditch as soon as possible he looked around the room and took in the enthusiastic nods noting that only snape looked rather put out dumbledore turned to madam hooch well rolanda the recommendation of the staff is that we initiate intramural quidditch games immediately is this feasible we might be able to work something out hooch replied drolly in fact i believe i will let professor dunlevy explain how certainly rolanda said rinna smartly stepping forward and appropriating the attention of everyone in the room she produced a small scroll from her palm and enlarged it as you can see here is a rotation of use times for the pitch that will allow not only the house teams to play but other organized pick up teams as well we have also set up a duty roster to provide adult supervision and if i may direct your attention professor flitwick was sputtering what why arinna i thought you wanted muggle sports his voice trailed off as he saw rinna grin really filius me not want quidditch in exchange for american football of all things did you know that the ball used for that isnteven round rinna laughed at the expression on the charms professor face flitwick pointed his finger at rinna and hooch in turn you both of you set us up he squeaked the room began to fill with chuckles taking command again rinna raised her voice and i suspect that you all will find this to your satisfaction she turned the oversized parchment over in order to get the pitch and stadium ready for play there is a great deal of work to be done enough work for oh say seventy students to tackle as they serve their detentions on the next saturday morning the room swelled with approving murmurs i daresay that should get the detention duty roster down to a manageable level again eh minerva noted professor sinistra as she peered at the parchment rinna observed argus filch turn a rather unhealthy shade of red at the thought of all those students getting off so easily in his opinion and she secretly was pleased that his latest plans for tortuously miserable detentions had been foiled the room was filled with the pleasant buzz of discussion for a few more minutes with rinna and hooch fielding questions until all were satisfied with the solution at least all except filch and the meeting began to break up rinna rolled up the parchment and gave it to mcgonagall when she turned around she found severus snape standing in front of her scrutinizing her charily she raised her eyebrow in inquiry he raised an eyebrow in return and drawled softly well played arinna how very slytherin of you one side of her mouth quirked upward impudently indeed severus that sounded suspiciously like a compliment coming from you he gave her a curt nod interpret it as you see fit goodnight rinna eyes followed snape as he stalked out of the room professor trelawney was standing near the door still wringing her hands the silly woman looked genuinely distressed rinna turned back to dumbledore and mcgonagall and gave them a nod before crossing the room to take the divination professor by the arm sybill dear did you not some time ago foresee that you and i would spend a pleasant evening drinking hot toddies trelawney squinted at the younger woman through her thick glasses i did she asked tremulously i quite sure you did rinna said firmly and isntit convenient that the kitchens are between us and your tower she gently led the woman out the door minerva watched the two women leave and sighed i am glad to see that in spite of everything she been through our arinna is still a kind and compassionate girl dumbledore chuckled he knew that even though as a schoolgirl rinna had tested and tried the deputy headmistress patience many times minerva had always had a soft spot for the titian haired spitfire as did he she had taken every brutal tragic card life had handed her and built herself a formidable hand dumbledore was rather pleased to have the opportunity to see how she would play that hand now that she d finally grown up and she turning out to be a rather useful girl as well just as i predicted all those years ago if you recall minerva mcgonagall tossed him a sour look did you foresee that with your inner eye albus she asked mockingly he blithely ignored her comment the mark of a good educator my dear professor is finding constructive ways to divert a potential troublemaker precocious swotty know it all energy and turn it to the school advantage that is why i made her a prefect you know she nodded and now you have made her a teacher yet another brilliant move on my part as you saw tonight the look on his face was pure cunning and now that i have her on staff i am quite eager to keep her here well it obvious she enjoys teaching and has a gift for it what subject do you have in mind for her next year then why we will need a defense against the dark arts teacher of course we will have a vacancy when moody leaves in june it is not unreasonable to drop the associate from the title she now carries is it mcgonagall looked at him a bit incredulously do you honestly think that something as simple as a change in job title will break the curse on the d a d a position dumbledore smiled serenely sometimes the best solutions to problems are simple ones my dear mcgonagall remained thoughtfully quiet before adding i suppose it would certainly be absurdly fitting if she was the one to break the curse now wouldntit i assure you that i would appreciate the irony of it minerva with a nod dumbledore took his leave rinna stood at the entrance to the quidditch stadium and scowled as she reviewed the reasons why she hated this very moment first and foremost the sun was not quite above the horizon yet never a happy observation for a non morning person secondly she had gotten to bed late the night before planning and organizing this day had taken them well into the evening but it was a certain blue eyed marauder who had kept her up past her bedtime a smile almost made it to her lips because that thought implied things much more naughty than what had actually happened they had spent a good two hours talking punctuated by some cuddling and handholding with an occasional kiss on the chaise on her back porch entirely her fault really that she was barely able to keep her eyes open this morning but then again they did have years of catching up to do snapping out of her reverie she noted the third reason for her cantankerousness it looked to her that the castle was vomiting out thousands of students who were trudging bleary eyed toward the quidditch field grumbling loudly the largest group detention in the history of hogwarts was about to begin here you look like you could use this a large mug of steaming liquid was thrust into her hands she peered up at madam hooch what is this she bent to sniff it espresso a potent version of coffee it will get you going are you much of a coffee drinker arinna i am now rinna stated fervently as she cautiously sipped even the smell of it was invigorating thanks rolanda hooch grinned here come the hordes i hope you are ready for this rinna groaned tell me why we have to do this again because we were the conniving witches who came up with this plan in order to save the school from utter destruction not to mention have a little quidditch fun the older woman answered in a hearty tone rinna scrubbed at her face with her hand and gave herself a few smart pats on her cheek in an attempt to perk up right remind me to never do any secret plotting with you again she grumbled hooch laughed drink up dear all in all the morning was going rather smoothly rinna thought with satisfaction as she circled above the pitch on her broom observing the controlled chaos that she and rolanda had orchestrated which suited her just fine there would be time for lunch before the first pick up game that afternoon and after a few hours serving as referee rinna would be able to floo home to a supposedly home cooked meal she smiled knowing that dorrie had managed to browbeat remus and sirius into some kind of dinner party congratulations on the quidditch victory dunnie dear she had written no doubt by the end of saturday you are going to be completely knackered i ll sweet talk remus into playing chef and we ll have everything ready for you when you get here rinna sighed one of these days she was going to have to demand an entire weekend off it was utterly frustrating to only be able to squeeze in a few hours here and there with sirius everyone at the school assumed she had a beau an idea that had probably germinated from the rather frequent morning posts she received that consisted of a rose and a letter and yet it hadntstruck anyone as strange that she had not yet spent a night away from hogwarts since the term started of course she was the one who d volunteered to help make this quidditch victory happen thus of her own free will giving up a chance to spend the day with her her what her lover well he certainly wasntthat yet damn it her fianc he wasntthat really anymore either her boyfriend her suitor inamorato swain flame she heaved an exasperated sigh okay so their situation was a bit unique renegade paramour come on rinna girl focus now you are supposed to be supervising clearly the buzz from the espresso hooch had handed her was wearing off she heard shouting below and glanced down and swore if there ever was a time for artificial stimulants in her system it was now for she saw an altercation underway a blond headed boy with balled up fists was heading for a flame haired boy and his brunet mate time for a little intervention with my favorite fourth years she thought grimly as she angled her broom downward the situation had only escalated to a bit of finger jabbing in the chest when rinna landed but dean thomas and seamus finnegan were already loping over from the gryffindor group and vincent crabbe and gregory goyle were treading a number of yards behind draco one baleful glare from professor dunlevy sent each pair of back up players hastening rearward to their respective housemates well gentlemen mind telling me what seems to be the problem here rinna fixed each boy with a stern eye harry and ron glanced at each other then shrugged draco it seemed decided to be on his best behavior when the professor who d recently been elevated from not worth thinking about to intriguing in his estimation suddenly appeared he smiled charmingly and said oh there no problem here professor dunlevy rinna eyes made the round of each boy again uh huh she said unconvinced that is good to hear because it would be a shame for you all to have put in so much hard work to get the pitch and the stadium ready only to not be able to play today her voice trailed off warningly the three caught her drift for they nodded so unless there is something i can do for you lads draco was seized with a sudden desire to prolong this encounter with the associate d a d a professor after all this was the closest he had ever been to having her undivided attention and besides the longer he talked to her the less work he would have to do now what could he say to keep dunlevy from sending him back draco eyes caught the glare reflected off the finish on her broom handle professor what kind of broom is that he asked he remembered madam hooch mentioning a silver arrow once and professor dunlevy broom sure looked silver he vaguely recalled something about the arrow being one of the fastest brooms of its time he was sure dunlevy would be impressed with his knowledge of brooms that is a silver arrow isntit he added with a knowing air ron who had poured over the book on broomsticks rinna had given harry for his birthday turned to him and scowled malfoy you dolt the silver arrow was one of the first racing brooms of the twentieth century if she had one of those in that kind of condition indicating the sparkling gleam on rinna broom she d have it in a glass case with fifty unbreakable charms on it harry snickered and draco looked furious rinna smoothly interjected i dontknow much about any brooms that came out before the seventies to be honest this one she held it out to draco much to harry annoyance is a silver dart a 1001 le to be exact draco took the broom inwardly pleased as he recognized the name now he was on track he gave a low whistle as he hefted the broom in his hand testing its balance of course the silver dart was the slytherin team broom for quite a few years rinna gave him an inscrutable look i was the first person at hogwarts to ever own one she added wryly i didntrealize i had started a trend she took the broom back as draco offered it to her and affectionately brushed her fingers along the handle but then she was a flashy piece of work in her day she still a fine looking broom professor draco smirked over at potter pleased to have commanded so much of professor dunlevy attention so far privately harry had to agree the dart was gorgeous although he was sure that malfoy only thought so because of the silver and green coloring harry had listened to the conversation with a deep scowl on his face trust malfoy to try to suck up to rinna he was just trying to get first crack at the pitch once play began harry was sure harry smirked when he remembered that he knew just how good that broom was those silver darts fly really well too he commented offhandedly he glanced at ron and the two boys shared a knowing grin draco sneered clearly thinking such talk was all bravado on harry part how would you know potter it not like you ve ever flown one before actually i have harry retorted in a challenging tone you know gentlemen rinna cut in quickly before ron could open his mouth and join the posturing i d be happy to talk brooms with you another time right now however i believe you have work to do and the sooner it is done the sooner some quidditch can be played she jutted her chin toward the group of slytherins draco should have been with and gave him a meaningful look he glared at the two gryffindors before nodding politely to the professor and left rinna turned to ron and harry no more slacking off for you two swaggerers either and cantyou just try to avoid malfoy and his cronies it would make my life a lot easier she smiled to take the edge off her comment he started it harry said sullenly rinna smile faded i didntask who started it i asked if you could avoid confrontations with him if at all possible honestly professor he goes out of his way to provoke us ron protested rinna studied the two of them her arms crossed i know i saw it i just dontwant a repeat of the snake incident ron smirked dontlike snakes he asked impudently no cheeky boy as a matter of fact i dontmind snakes at all i just prefer not to tangle with more than oh a dozen at a time she grinned at them harry looked at her his expression still cross malfoy was just sucking up to you you know he told his godmother rinna mentally rolled her eyes thank you for pointing that out harry but as one who spent many an opportunity sucking up to teachers myself i think i can recognize the maneuver was her droll reply she saw of course that harry was jealous of the attention she d given draco to him the slytherin boy would never be anything but a thorn in his side she cocked her head thoughtfully i suppose it is a good thing that you donthave to resort to that with me now isntit you know that you can stop by and talk brooms with me anytime right thankfully the megawatt smile made a come back just brooms he asked mischievously she grinned again brooms quidditch girls whatever i d say any topic is fair game thanks rinna he said blushing a bit at her mention of girls before taking ron elbow and heading back to his task rinna sighed in relief and wondered if hooch had any more of that espresso she decided to investigate rinna was on her pre curfew rounds when she heard the rabble that was the gryffindor quidditch team making its way into the castle after a friday evening practice she wound her way down the marble staircase smiling at the flushed and happy faces the last two weekends of intramural quidditch and informal matches between the house teams had been just what was needed to curb the restlessness of the teenaged population of hogwarts hi professor dunlevy well well it looks like the lions will be ready to roar tomorrow against ravenclaw i dare say she responded there were boisterous shouts and cheers to the affirmative unfortunately i wontbe there to see the action i afraid she added regretfully what demanded george weasley why not well i have the weekend off you see she explained at the loud protests she placed her hands on her hips as hard as this may be to believe there is such a thing as needing a break from all of you fred grasped at his chest dramatically what a cruel thing to say you have wounded us deeply i sure you ll get over it was rinna dry reply the gryffindors laughed and began moving up the stairs to their dorms but harry hung back a bit are you really not going to be there tomorrow he asked quietly he d been looking forward to discussing the matches with her again like they d done last week i afraid so harry i sorry but i have other plans harry grinned cheekily your plans wouldntinclude my godfather now would they she narrowed her eyes at him in a mock scowl you re a nosy thing arentyou as a matter of fact they just might you ve been seeing him haventyou he asked eagerly the almost desperate look on his face made her want to laugh and cry at the same time she had quite forgotten that harry had been so hopeful for her and sirius to make up she could sense how important it still was to him to be honest harry not nearly enough she chuckled when his eyes grew wide at her confession that why i so keen to have this weekend off i just haventhad the time lately to spend with him short of grabbing a few hours here and there but you are back together arentyou harry voice was full of hope rinna put her hand on his shoulder and smiled at him we ve agreed to give it a go there are you happy now rinna was surprised to see one of those looks that made the wearer appear older and wiser than his years cross harry features as he nodded sagely before asking dead serious are you his expectant eyes searched rinna face her smile softened as she returned his gaze steadily her brows creasing pensively yes she whispered yes harry i am the audacious grin returned and i ll bet that s uh snuffles is too she cuffed him lightly on the shoulder off with you insolent scamp before i take points for being out after curfew harry could hear the suppressed laughter in her voice well have a nice weekend he waved cheerily and took the steps two at a time in an attempt to catch up to his teammates you see sirius said remus lupin as he heard the whoosh that indicated someone had flooed in i told you not to expect her before noon the woman keeps abominable hours ha ha you are hilarious lupin retorted the red head who walked into the kitchen i ll have you know that i was out shopping she set her shopping bags on the counter after applying the un shrinking charm and started to put the groceries away sirius got up from the table where he d been leaning lazily back in his chair watching remus prepare lunch to help what this he asked taking some odd packets out rinna seized them from his hand with a yelp careful with those they re some rather delicate potions ingredients darklings grimm never heard of them they must be new to diagon alley i suppose commented sirius remus looked over his shoulder from where he stood at the counter giving rinna the raised eyebrow before asking her casually doing more brewing than just the wolfsbane i take it i have another private commission she answered evasively sirius was surprised by the defensiveness in her tone and he looked curiously from one to the other what wrong with that he asked remus nothing remus replied evenly i just curious as to what kind of potion requires you to shop for ingredients in knockturn alley that all sirius eyebrows went up you went to knockturn alley he asked rinna disapprovingly rinna turned around to lean against the counter with an exasperated huff oh dontget your knickers all in a twist you two i can take care of myself you know i ve been in far more dodgy places than knockturn alley when i was in eastern europe all right maybe i shouldnthave mentioned that she saw the nearly identical looks of fierce protectiveness on their faces except that sirius also wore a trace of wariness i working on something for dumbledore if you must know she sighed does that make you feel any better only slightly remus noted dryly rinna looked at sirius come on blackie do you picture me nipping off to knockturn on a regular basis for my weekly shopping spree of hands of glory and pentacruxes she cajoled sirius studied her his arms crossed frown on his face no rinna he said quietly my overactive imagination pictures you being kidnapped by dark wizards and mistreated while i am completely unaware rinna eyes grew round oh she whispered you know about that she turned not quite accusing eyes on remus who shrugged apologetically you cantblame us for being concerned rinna remus commented even if we know you can take care of yourself we canthelp it it a guy thing it a territorial canis lupis thing more likely she said flippantly desperately covering the wealth of emotions that sirius had just evoked besides she turned to sirius pulling out a long package from one of the bags and handing it to him if i hadntgone there i wouldnthave been able to get you this sirius stared at the box in his hands it was long and thin the perfect size for a is this a wand he asked incredulously he opened it sure enough nestled carefully in dark blue satin was a wand how did rinna gently pushed him into a chair and sat next to him look the fact is that there are plenty of shops that wontkeep records of who buys their wands and there are plenty of excellent wand crafters that just cantbreak into the market that ollivander and gregorovitch have cornered this one she took the wand from the box and twirled it causing it to emit coppery sparks happened to be made by a first rate craftsman in the czech republic i ve used his wands before the quality is exceptional and why would you need more than one wand anyway sirius questioned for my research on my dissertation it was on potions to counter dark curses and i certainly couldntuse my own wand to cast any her voice drifted off at the look on sirius face this was a mistake he doesnttrust me sirius stared at rinna in dismay not at the idea that she had actually cast dark curses although that was something they would certainly need to add to the list of things to talk over nor even the knowledge that she knew how to get black market wands but at the thought that she was to all intents and purposes arming a wanted man you you re his words jumbled up on his tongue huge mistake rinna girl she thought as she misinterpreted his reaction i sorry she stood up slammed the wand into the box and tried to pull it out of sirius hands rinna wait he rose but held onto it tightly just wait please she let go of the box it just that he ran his hand through his hair it just that you realize what a risk you are taking dontyou it one thing to harbor a fugitive and you ll be in enough trouble for that but arming one you jeopardize everything you ve worked for she glared at him her chin tilted stubbornly her eyes nearly shooting sparks in her defiance i don t care dontyou see her eyes flicked to the wand in his hands and back sod the law i love you there was a beat of silence before sirius took the one step necessary to close the distance between them and swept her into his arms crushing his lips to hers in a fierce kiss if anything happened to you because of me he began gruffly only to be cut off by her mouth covering his once again the doorbell rang and remus leapt for the kitchen door with alacrity talk about being saved by the bell he muttered sirius and rinna broke apart with a laugh who could it be rinna wondered my chameleon cousin here to join us for lunch of course sirius grinned so remus said nymphadora tonks as the four left the kitchen i was wondering i have a case that i could use your expertise on really said remus as if this was news to him i d be happy to lend my assistance brilliant tonks grinned before her expression turned thoughtful but i afraid i ve left the files on my table at home oh oh well i suppose i could come by there to help you out remus offered glancing at tonks and holding her gaze meaningfully before striding to the closet to fetch his coat tonks beamed color high in her cheeks would you that d be ace and for your trouble i going to take you to see that folk quartet i was telling you about they are playing at the little muggle pub down the street tonight remus took her coat and draped it over his on his arm that sounds like an excellent plan to me he placed his hand on the small of her back causing her blush to deepen he gently led her to the fireplace and with a quick wave the two were gone to tonks flat in a flare of green flame rinna turned to sirius who was leaning with his arms crossed against the doorframe to the kitchen that was rather odd i suppose they were discreetly trying to give us some time alone her eyebrows pulled together quizzically a smile played at his lips i suppose so but i think it more likely they were trying to give themselves some time alone sirius saw an incredulous look take over her face as her mouth dropped open and he made a little choking cough you mean to tell me that you didntknow that remus was spending no small amount of time in the company of my little cousin what rinna glanced at him suspiciously really dorrie failed to mention that she saw that sirius was not pulling her leg you re not joking he shook his head oh she tried to recover her composure well that just well sirius started chuckling rinna frowned at him you re laughing at me because i was a little slow on the uptake arentyou his bark like laughter rang out all right i ll admit you caught me by surprise although i not sure why i should be surprised really after all they went together to the quidditch world cup and dorrie has fancied him for ages and sweet merlin that excuse she just used sounded remarkably like the old i left my textbook back on the astronomy tower and i need your help to go find it line sirius chortled a few more moments before he flicked his gaze back to her he saw several emotions play across her face all too quickly for him to read are you sure you re okay about this he asked about my two best friends possibly uh she clamped down on the sudden twinge in her heart jealous are you you selfish thing you yourself said that remus deserves the love of a good woman and dorrie is dorrie is one of the best people i know as is remus and besides people who are in love have that silly desire for everyone around them to be in love too so she paused to tell her heart that she really meant what she was about to say i happy for them a roguish grin crossed his face are you saying you are in love ruby red he asked softly still leaning indolently in the doorway a subtle undertone in his voice seemed to charge the air in the room his blue eyes held her gaze the twinge rinna felt this time was different oh her heart could play its fickle little games but it could not escape the fact that this man was truly the one who held it captive she had gladly surrendered it many years ago and she would gladly do so again why yes i am blackie she answered with a sultry smile and isntit convenient that i find i am completely by myself with the object of my affection she stepped forward moving dangerously close to him his voice was husky rather convenient indeed he agreed so tell me what do you intend to do with me now that you have me all alone ruby red she looked at him appraisingly the hair was long well it looks good on him that way but needed trimming the beard still not sure how i feel about that unkempt might be sexy if it was trimmed except it hides the angle of his jaw she had always loved his jaw line he was thin so thin no longer the muscular young man she had known azkaban had seen to that the thought stabbed her heart you need cosseting love she took his hand and gently tugged him towards her bedroom he shook his head with a quizzical smile taken off guard by her unexpected response but followed her she led him into her bathroom sirius watched her as she pulled towels from the cabinet and turned it was an unnerving feeling she seemed familiar and yet so strange to him he knew her so well and yet didntreally know her at all not anymore that much was made obvious by their scene in the kitchen earlier he drank her in wanting her and apprehensive at the same time i believe you already know where the shower is she said with an impish smile handing him the towels make it hot lots of steam you need to soften up all the hair on your face hang on what are you planning she grinned raised an eyebrow and cocked her head toward the alcove with the shower move it blackie she listened to the water run as she made her preparations she set up a chair near the vanity and conjured all the items she needed he not ten feet from me water running down his body hair slicked back her pulse quickened she felt an odd pressure in her chest like her heart was straining against her ribs in a mad attempt to escape escape what she froze very gently her mind told her escape the prison you built around it she took a deep breath and nodded this was right this was what was supposed to be and no walls no amount of time away not even the hurt or pain could make her heart stop feeling what it was now sirius he was real he was here and she was blessedly being given a second chance one that she would not let pass her by clouds of steam billowed like fog on a cold morning the water shut off sirius emerged with a towel slung around his waist and with another he was drying his hair he stopped when he saw the set up and raised an eyebrow just shut it and get over here she smirked what i didntsay anything i hope for your sake mr black that you do not plan on being contrary depends on what you have in mind first we modify your hirsute appearance she nudged him into the chair mmmm you know i love it when you use big words professor s matter not attracted to the shaggy look on snuffles maybe she had him hold a warm moist towel to his face while she cut his hair he closed his eyes and enjoyed the sensation of her hands in his hair then she took the towel away and applied cream to his face her touch was slow and gentle he heard her murmur an incantation and opened his eyes to see her holding an old fashioned straight razor his eyes locked onto hers in the mirror she smirked again and said i charmed it so it will cut only hair not skin dontknow how steady my hands will be around you wouldntthis be easier with magic he eyed the razor warily easier yes but trust me this will be far more enjoyable you ll see now shut it wisely he said no more she stood behind him leaned his head back against her belly and carefully scraped the razor across his face wiping away shaving cream with gentle caresses of the towel or her hand sirius lost himself in the pleasure of her ministrations huh rinna grunted in satisfaction at her handiwork he lifted his head and looked in the mirror his face looked painfully thin no longer hidden in whiskers his hand unconsciously went to his chin very smooth he complimented she rubbed her knuckles across his cheek and smiled flattery is always appreciated blackie she said in a husky voice he made to grasp her hand but she pulled it away ah ah ah i am not done with you yet she said saucily his eyebrows went up she poured some lotion in her hands and warmed it she stood behind him again and placed her hands on his shoulders and proceeded to massage every taut muscle her hands found each tender spot and meticulously pressed and prodded rubbed and glided until the tension melted away she moved on to his shoulder blades spending many minutes there then his upper chest then his neck and his arms finally she took each hand and caressed the pressure points that she knew would bring relaxation sirius felt his thoughts and emotions dissolve into mist as his awareness narrowed to only the perception of her hands on his skin how long had it been since someone had really touched him he had had no human contact in azkaban and really none since his escape well except for occasional hugs and claps on the back of course not to mention some satisfying albeit brief snogging with the woman whose talented hands were now touching him but all of those were fleeting contacts compared to this constancy of skin on skin he reveled in the sheer sensuality of it not in a carnal way but in an even deeper consciousness of the human need for nurture and connection with another human being rinna let go of his hand and trailed her fingers up his arm along his shoulder blades and across his collar bone never breaking contact with him as she circled around in front of him his eyes were closed his face peaceful she felt her heart stutter in her chest he looks beautiful she placed a hand on each side of his neck where it met the collar bones and straddled him sitting on his lap blue eyes flew open startled and looked into green what are you doing it came out more high pitched than he intended it she leaned her forehead against his her hand caressing his smooth cheek his breath hitched s he is so close smells so good i trying to seduce you she said her voice deep and sultry of their own volition one of his hands moved to the small of her back the other to her face the base of his thumb rested at the corner of her mouth his index and middle finger held her earlobe while the last two fingers rested on her neck she turned into his hand grazing her lips back and forth against his palm where the thumb joined his hand he swallowed hard how am i doing so far her breath brushed his lips brilliantly he sighed and their lips met in that instant coherent thought dissipated like smoke in the wind the kiss was sweet and tender and almost reverent it seared rinna to her soul and burned away any awareness other than his mouth on hers it was as if they had never kissed before lips hesitant testing assessing soon though their bodies began to respond to the memory of kisses past the tentativeness disappeared and sirius took her face in his hands and peppered her lips with gently insistent kisses simultaneously sweet and demanding she opened her mouth teasing his lips with her tongue pleading for entrance to his alluring mouth he complied eagerly the reverence was gone replaced by fiery kisses that implied desire and longing decadence and ardor their world had been reduced to clashing tongues passionate glances and roaming hands rinna felt like she was flying and yet at the same time she was drowning in the heat of his mouth his gaze and his touch she willed it to never end the inevitable need for oxygen finally exerted itself and they pulled away from each other breaths raggedy and frantic and only millimeters apart rinna sirius gasped we need to get up from this chair legs are going numb she grinned and said with mock incredulity are you saying my kisses leave you numb oh no m lady a flirtatious smile played at his lips your kisses electrify me like lightning she leaned forward and pulled at his bottom lip with hers well they had she kissed his top lip ruddy well and tugged at it with her teeth better mister her tongue ran across his bottom lip as she stood up eliciting a groan from him and he followed her mouth upwards the towel which was fortunately or perhaps unfortunately charmed to stay wrapped around his hips did nothing to hide just how electrified he was sirius quickly hooked one arm around rinna waist and pulled her against him while his other hand grasped her jaw and drew her mouth to his rinna slid her hands up his chest and around his neck and deepened the kiss she began maneuvering him toward the bedroom walking him backwards while keeping his mouth captive but somehow missed the door and ended up knocking sirius against the door frame wrenching their lips apart he let out a startled huff of breath she started to giggle sirius mock scowled at her merlin knickers woman is this your idea of seduction braining me on a door frame she attempted a smirk through her laughter if it will keep you from being so mouthy mouthy he growled i ll show you mouthy he swiftly spun rinna around grabbed her wrists with one hand and pulled them up over her head pinning her to the door frame he pressed his hips against her body and held her there cupping the back of her head with the other hand he proceeded to thoroughly ravage her mouth with his rinna moaned appreciatively and parted her lips allowing his tongue to dance with hers the heat from her mouth the softness of her lips the sounds she was making deep in her throat lit every nerve in sirius body with desire he traced her jaw line with kisses nibbling and licking at her earlobe he let go of her wrists and slipped his hand to the small of her back under the hem of her shirt her skin was soft and hot under his hand she threaded her fingers through his hair and hungrily pulled his mouth back to hers he groaned and pulled her closer against him and let out a hiss when he felt her hips rock against his her knees turned to jelly when he growled against her ear keep that up ruby and i not gonna last much longer she looked up at him pure mischief on her face as her hand undid the towel his breath hitched at her touch you are trying to push me over the edge arentyou you minx blackie blackie she chided teasingly you are too far gone for anything to last more that a few seconds and i ll be damned if the first time we make love in thirteen years is nothing but a quickie she led him back to the chair where it all started let me take care of you baby she said in a husky whisper and proceeded to put action to her words when sirius higher cognitive functions began working again he opened his eyes and came face to face with the button of rinna jeans with a cheeky grin he looked up at her and murmured there appears to be a problem with these jeans she arched an eyebrow at him and played along grinning oh really what seems to be the problem the problem is they are still on you fortunately he was happy to gallantly remedy the situation for her he undid the button and zipper and then slipped his hands inside the waistband and slowly began to slide them down over her hips she did a provocative little wriggle to help shimmy the denims off her body and stepped out of them kicking them to the side sirius ran his hands along the smooth skin that was exposed below her shirt reveling in the texture and warmth of it seeing no reason to deny himself any longer sirius began kissing her belly her navel moving down her body his mouth moved over her enchanting her body ensnaring her senses with his own brand of magic she felt the warmth coiling deep within her like a serpent ready to strike and moaned he stood and claimed her mouth with his lifting her right leg and wrapping it around his waist she gasped at the intimate contact and pulled her face away looking into his sapphire eyes that were almost black with desire she felt like molten lava hot and pliable in his hands this was comfortingly familiar this spell he wove over her with just a touch of his lips and fingers and just a look from his eyes it had been far far too long since she d been under this particular ensorcellment she returned to his lips voraciously kissing them as if she was speaking in a language only he could understand leaving no doubt in his mind as to how much she wanted him he reached for her knickers and with a guttural sound he tore them off her mmmm feeling a bit randy are we she panted yes damn it rinna he said heatedly i need you with one wave of his arm he swept the items from her vanity and lifted her there she pulled him to her and again she kissed him deeply pouring all she was feeling into the kiss her passion was met by his and they were consumed by desperate willful desire their first coupling was heated frantic passionate rinna rested her forehead against his as her breathing finally returned to a somewhat normal rate damn was all she could say he grinned and kissed her gently damn he agreed he pulled her close wrapping his arms around her tightly and burying his face in her hair her hands moved to his waist then slid up his back as she pressed herself to him resting her head in the crook of his shoulder now that he was her lover again she would be damned if she didnttake every opportunity she had to hold him close she began to nibble on his neck her lips found his pulse point and she flicked it with her tongue she spent the next few minutes lavishing attention on his neck his shoulders his chest desire stirred in him again she felt the tell tale sign and smiled in anticipation taking his hand come on she whispered her hand trembling a little as he grasped hers firmly where are we going he asked innocently but the effect was ruined by the wicked gleam in his eye sirius black we are not in school anymore there is no reason to be shagging desperately against a broom closet wall or on a bathroom sink when i have a perfectly good bed in the next room he leered at her enjoying the memories her words had summoned to his mind yes ma am he swung her up in his arms marching them into her bedroom sirius carefully set her on the side of her bed and promptly tumbled in with her as she pulled him down he grumbled i was going to take off your shirt you wanton hussy call me names will you she growled you ll pay for that you know she rolled him onto his back climbed on top of him and enticingly removed her shirt and bra he groaned his approval she proceeded to kiss him thoroughly all over his body again he retaliated decisively by reversing their positions and kissing her in kind she finally reached for his head and pulled his lips back up to hers he sighed and stretched out next to her skin against skin and buried his face in her neck inhaling her scent sirius she breathed he knew from experience that when she used his given name he should attend closely i haventbeen complete without you her endearing words flooded him with passion far deeper than any of the flirtatious banter had the second time they made love was slow and tender and sweet sirius stirred into wakefulness and sensing darkness unfamiliar surroundings and hot weight pressing him down stiffened momentarily in panic rinna moved against him and murmured you all right he felt her warm skin against his her leg thrown possessively over him her hand on his upper arm her head on his chest soft short hair tickling his chin for a terrifying moment he thought this isnthappening this is a fantasy you have invoked with your mind she will never be yours again are you real he whispered if i open my eyes will you still be here always she breathed as she pressed her lips and body to his a n woo hoo my story is over 100 000 words now help me celebrate by leaving a review dontask me what a pentacrux actually is

my beta lorett is the best and i love her to infinity and beyond on the evening of friday the 30th of october the entire population of hogwarts students was assembled at the top of the lawns which afforded an unhindered view of the grounds and the lake rinna could feel the thrum of excitement as countless bodies struggled to keep still in anticipation of the arrival of the groups from beauxbatons and durmstrang rinna herself was impressed at the arrival of the huge beauxbatons carriage and with the sudden appearance of the durmstrang ship in the lake she was sure her grin was as wide as any enthusiastic first year there however the smile slid off her face faster than wax dripped from a candle at the sight of the man leading the durmstrang students to the castle a voice hissed in her ear what do you make of that she whirled to find mad eye moody at her left side squinting grimly at igor karkaroff she unceremoniously grabbed the man elbow and pulled him in the castle doors and to a shadowy corner of the entrance hall karkaroff was sent to azkaban she insisted in a low voice ah but later he made a deal with the ministry he named names moody informed her dourly he bought his freedom rinna looked incredulous and he was allowed to become the headmaster of durmstrang i know the school has a reputation for dark arts but would its board of governors hire a known death eater says he reformed from his death eater ways moody voice was drenched in bitterness her face was creased with skepticism i suppose it could be true she said slowly moody brusquely cut in arinna do you honestly believe that people change their ways he eyed her as if she was a na ve little girl she studied him keenly she and moody had not agreed over much all those years ago some things didntchange it seemed but rinna thought about severus snape who d apparently defected from the death eaters during the war and conversely she remembered with no small amount of sorrow peter pettigrew who d given himself over to darkness i do believe that people can change their ways if they choose to do so she said softly moody snorted we all have free will after all moody the ring of the footsteps of the durmstrang delegation on the stone floor of the entrance hall interrupted them and they stood quietly in the shadows as the group passed by karkaroff in the lead heading into the great hall the hogwarts students began to stream in noisily so rinna had to lean in very close to moody to add but that doesntmean that i wontbe keeping a close eye on karkaroff moody grunted good for a moment there i thought you d traded in your shrewd smarts for touchy feely sensibility rinna frowned as she entered the great hall and followed moody to the head table there was something slightly off the mark about the conversation she d just had with the old auror but she couldntquite put her finger on it however the feast and the subsequent opening of the triwizard tournament pushed the niggling thought out of her mind halloween night found rinna at the edge of her seat at the staff table barely able to eat as she waited in anticipation for the presentation of the triwizard champions she had spent the morning quietly observing in the entrance hall as students began to place their names in the goblet of fire all of the hogwarts students who entered were in her sixth or seventh year d a d a classes several of them who had defied dumbledore age line went to the hospital wing with beards much to the amusement of those watching privately rinna ranked each applicant as they nervously stepped forward but in the end she was glad it wasntshe who was making the decision there were just too many capable and talented students to choose from and soon she would know which of her students would represent the school she couldntbelieve that she could be this wound up over a contest not just any contest silly these champions will be facing real danger and you are going to be biting your nails over them until the end of the tournament in the short time she d been teaching she reflected she d become rather fond of the student body of hogwarts most of the time the cheering and applause at the announcement of cedric diggory of hufflepuff as hogwarts champion was deafening rinna grinned and clapped enthusiastically cedric was a fine choice in her opinion he was an excellent and talented student and besides she thought it is high time the badgers got some of the glory the handsome young man made his way to the room behind the staff table a huge smile on his face the joyful enthusiasm that filled the great hall was short lived however for something strange was transpiring the goblet of fire turned red a fourth time shooting out an arm of flame with a fourth slip of paper and rinna was seized by a cold frisson of apprehension this was not supposed to happen her eyes along with every one else s were riveted to dumbledore as he stared at the slip in his hand for what seemed an interminable amount of time rinna truly was not prepared to hear him read the name on the slip harry potter for a moment the only sound to be heard in the great hall was the rustle of hundreds of heads whipping around to stare at the boy at the gryffindor table rinna mouth was open in stunned surprise as she watched harry turn to his friends blankly minerva had rushed down to dumbledore and was muttering to him fiercely and still rinna could not move she felt as if she d been struck by the lead limb hex dumbledore called harry forward and the bewildered boy made his way up the long tables rinna watched the scene unfold like one of those slow motion sequences in a muggle film while the low pitched drone of angry and astounded whispers seemed to distort and fade as if she was under water by all the moons of jupiter how could this have happened she wanted to jump up and protest but the strange lassitude held her to her seat rinna could only watch in shock as dumbledore prompted harry to move through the door behind the staff table and join the other triwizard champions then suddenly harry was passing by her and the sound of the whispering students rushed back to her ears as the room returned to normal speed she schooled her features to something that she hoped was reassuring because he looked absolutely stunned like a bunny before a hungry hippogriff she watched the door waiting for her opportunity to slip into it because the godmother part of her was hysterically demanding that she get her sorry arse in there this instant and do something for the love of merlin ludo bagman went through the door and was soon followed by dumbledore maxime karkaroff barty crouch mcgonagall and snape the door closed behind them and the buzzing of amazed chatter grew louder now that attention was away from the head table rinna rose and unobtrusively made her way to the door opened it and slipped in stealthily she crept into the room unnoticed and preferring not to draw attention to her presence she took up residence standing just beyond the ring of light to observe karkaroff was ranting about the age line but severus broke in it no one fault but potter s karkaroff dontgo blaming professor dumbledore for potter determination to break the rules he has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here snape words were drenched in bitterness and malice dumbledore had turned to question harry and rinna was relieved to see that harry looked the headmaster right in the eye and vehemently denied putting his name in or asking an older student to do it for him during the heated argument among the adults that followed rinna observed her godson with concern he still had that wide eyed stunned expression for the most part but seemed a bit perturbed that he was being accused of lying she spun around when she heard the door open behind her alastor moody merely looked at her and grunted as he brushed past her into the room harry was trying to devote his attention to what was being said by the grown ups figuring that they werentlikely to censor their words when they were all worked up like that he hoped to find out something useful to help him figure out exactly what had just happened he felt an odd feeling like someone was watching him and his eyes swept around the room the other students were glued to the argument that all the adults were having his eyes caught a shape standing closest to the door just beyond the penumbra of light cast by the lanterns he inhaled sharply it was his godmother she was watching him intently with a rather impenetrable expression on her face for one fraction of a second harry thought that it was rinna who had put his name in the goblet of fire moody was ranting that it had to have been some skilled witch or wizard who put harry name in the goblet with the intention of having him killed but the moment harry saw the look of fear and maternal horror that crossed rinna features he immediately dismissed the idea she was every inch the concerned godmother he started to mouth something to her but she shook her head touched her finger to her lips and then cupped her ear indicating she wanted to concentrate on what was being said harry had to return his attention to mr crouch to hear his instructions so he missed seeing the color drain from rinna face when the students were told they were not allowed to ask for or receive help from their teachers damn it she thought to herself he too young he hasntlearned enough yet to make it through these tasks how in the hell can i keep him safe if they tie my hands like this rinna painted on an impassive expression as barty crouch left and madame maxime and her prot g swept by followed by karkaroff and viktor krum karkaroff fixed her with a dark glare to which she merely raised her eyebrow dumbledore directed harry and cedric diggory to return to their respective common rooms suggesting that their houses should not be deprived of a chance to celebrate harry hesitated slightly until dumbledore added arinna would you be kind enough to remain here a few moments he would have to talk to his godmother tomorrow it seemed when the boys had left mcgonagall rounded on rinna with a slightly outraged expression what are you doing here arinna she demanded rinna crossed her arms and scowled isntit obvious minerva she snapped i was eavesdropping although i dontthink that it can technically be called eavesdropping if i was standing in plain sight observing perhaps dumbledore smoothly intervened ludo my good man would you mind terribly waiting in the great hall for a few moments i should like to have a word with my staff here of course not replied a rather jovial annoyingly and inappropriately jovial in rinna opinion ludo bagman as he stepped out of the room rinna moved closer to dumbledore her green eyes snapping in anger please tell me you are not serious about letting harry compete in this tournament since when do you lead lambs to the slaughter albus dumbledore looked at his youngest teacher with concern now arinna he said gently i know you are worried about young harry but you heard what barty said as soon as his name came out of the goblet harry was bound to compete i afraid there is nothing i can do dumbledore eyes dropped to the floor fatigue and worry lining his face bound to compete she sputtered but each student entered into a binding magical contract only if he or she put his or her own name on the paper the contract cantpossibly be binding if someone else put a champion name in the goblet please tell me there was some provision made for that possibility albus once again rinna mouth dropped open in horror as she saw by the looks on dumbledore and mcgonagall faces that indeed no such stipulation had been made sweet mother of merlin she whispered before she steeled her voice and said louder harry potter did not put his name in that goblet snape made a sound of disbelief causing rinna to whip around and fix him with a dangerous look the potions professor was markedly reminded of a dragon ready to protect its clutch his eyes narrowed in speculation i sorry arinna but there is nothing i can do dumbledore repeated quietly rinna anger had been ignited by fear for her godson but dumbledore apparent reticence seemed to fuel it further she looked back to him and retorted well you could have at least protested that ridiculous rule that champions can not accept help from a teacher snape gave a derisive snort apparently you still hold rules in contempt then arinna you have much in common with young potter but then you had much in common with the elder potter and his cronies back in school didntyou rinna ground her teeth snape was never going to let go of that old hatred was he it was blinding him now to seeing how unfair it was to ask a mere fourteen year old to compete against students who had twice as much training well she wasntafraid to raise holy hell to the roof of the great hall if she had to i just saying she said through a clenched jaw that the rule puts harry at an unfair disadvantage he had only half the education the others have minerva interrupted she right albus something has to be done snape threw up his hands in exasperation and glared balefully at the two women dontyou understand there is nothing that can be done the tournament has started it must be allowed to play out to the end he glanced at dumbledore who still looked haggard and if any solution to this most distressing turn of events is to be found be assured that our esteemed headmaster will be the one to find it but not if you insist on yammering at him like harpies mcgonagall pulled her chin up in a huff well rinna shot snape her best killing glare she hated it but he was right damn it the greasy git she took a deep breath and exhaled forcing herself to calm down she turned to the headmaster her heart breaking a little to see him so worn with care forgive me albus for losing my temper i afraid i not able to be very objective right now she said humbly it is completely understandable that you are apprehensive for harry arinna i assure you that i respect the maternal instinct that prompted your behavior here tonight he looked at her seriously i will do my best to not fail you or him rinna voice broke a little of course you will i would never believe otherwise she turned to nod at the others and moody cast her an inscrutable look she left in a swirl of robes she was halfway through the now empty great hall before she heard her name called she turned abruptly around to face the brooding figure of the potions professor what do you want she gritted out hadnthe been insufferable enough for one evening he studied her with a shuttered expression do you know that you are developing quite a reputation among the students for being fair for not showing favoritism among the houses why most of them cannot even figure out what house you belonged to when you went to hogwarts she looked at him sourly and your point is my point is that gives you a measure of power that i or mcgonagall or any of the others really will never have it would be a shame and i think i know you well enough to say it would go against your nature as well to give away that power now he raised a hand to forestall her retort i should have realized that you would favor harry potter in fact i dontknow why it should surprise me that you would of course i would he my rinna looked at severus snape cold black eyes and remembered the malice that had riddled his diatribe about harry earlier she would not give snape more ammunition against harry she modified what she was about to say he my dearest friend son i cannot just stand by and do nothing while he is put in mortal danger certainly i just hate to see positions of power compromised for the sake of mere sentimentality she looked at him icily forgive me severus if your definition of sentimentality seems to coincide with my definition of loyalty and friendship snape considered her a moment and nodded curtly i see that young potter is yet another subject on which we must agree to disagree he said impassively apparently she replied scathingly before stalking out of the great hall rinna promptly exited the castle and began walking toward the lake the thoughts and anxieties that had been neither nullified nor appeased by the confrontation with dumbledore seething in her mind how could she help harry how could she obtain information about the first task how could this have happened she stopped at the edge of the lake and shook her fists in frustration a fine job you did of taking care of harry rinna if only she d been paying better attention watching the goblet for tampering if only she had anticipated that something like this would happen if only a rather loud splash broke into the ugly cycle of her thoughts causing rinna to jump she huffed out a rueful little laugh at the sight of several large sucker covered tentacles lifting out of the lake and slapping playfully on the water surface in succession at least the giant squid had shaken her from her pointless musings she d learned from experience that playing the if only game was a useless endeavor to be sure she could not have predicted any of these happenings but now she needed to think needed to sort things out there was no way she was letting harry face this alone tournament rules be damned she sat down on a rock by the edge of the water and let out a growl of aggravation she was annoyed with herself for tipping her hand to snape he d surely be watching for any signs of her helping harry now and would take great delight in declaring harry a cheat damn him and damn his childhood grudges that he just couldntseem to let go of and this line of thinking was just another fast train to nowhere think rinna think you need some way of getting information and passing it to harry that cannot be traced back to you you need some cunning sneaky crafty ingenious plan cunning crafty sneaky ingenious rinna snapped her fingers this sounds like a job for a marauder she said out loud and it was a damn good thing she knew just where to find some she almost laughed out loud in relief remus and sirius would help she had no doubt but she quickly sobered when she realized that she would need to be careful when she told them what happened sirius was likely to floo right into hogwarts and do something drastic when he heard what kind of danger harry was in she somehow had to redirect sirius for everyone sake and to be fair to dumbledore after all he d already dealt with one angry godparent tonight a large wet splash was so close that she felt droplets of cold water on her face she let out a little involuntary shriek and scrambled to higher ground the squid was playing again well she told herself at least someone was enjoying himself herself this wretched night this night a memory whispered on the edge of her already frayed mind this night halloween thirteen years she stood stock still oh lily rinna whispered stricken i so sorry how could i have forgotten this year will be different padfoot remus said as he set out the glasses this year you will join in a venerable tradition instead of spending halloween alone sirius looked skeptical how long have you and rinna had this tradition he queried for the last two years two years if it only two years moony how can it be a venerable tradition donttraditions take decades to even become traditions sirius crossed his arms and scowled he knew what remus was trying to do but he d marked the last twelve anniversaries on his own immersed in bitterness and grief he didntthink some little ritual was going to make him feel any better dontbother me with trifles padfoot i think it is my prerogative to call it a tradition if i want to remus said testily as he opened the decanter sirius stared glumly at the glass on the coffee table in front of him as remus filled it and waited until remus had topped off his own glass before taking it in hand he swirled the amber liquid thoughtfully then lifted his eyes to look at his friend there only half now moony he said hoarsely remus drew his brows together in confusion thinking sirius was referring to the firewhiskey what do you mean half half as in half sirius said impatiently frustrated when remus didntfollow his explanation half of the marauders sirius was relieved to see remus eyes widen in comprehension and half of the reds it was remus turn to swirl and contemplate his drink as he smiled wistfully remembering the appellation that sirius had assigned to rinna and lily in fourth year he d dubbed them the reds much to the girls annoyance and the nickname had stuck of course it hadntbeen meant to be an endearment but more of a taunt so when the annoyance factor had worn off a bit by some time in fifth year and the need to differentiate which red was being talked about or teased arose sirius simply added rose to lily name keeping in theme with flowers and rose red was born lily merely laughed and suggested he d ripped it off from some muggle fairy tale book by the brothers grimm remus remembered that it had taken much longer for sirius to come up with a name for rinna he d been rather stumped unable to find anything fitting until one day in some verbal skirmish that the two of them always seemed engaged in sirius had told rinna she had a heart of stone and voila she became ruby red and remus was quite sure that that was the moment when sirius had unwittingly started to fall for her wish she was here remus heard sirius mumble she shouldntbe alone this night remus pulled himself out of his reverie she got the excitement of the tournament to keep her occupied she ll at least be distracted tonight wish we had something to take our minds off of it though i thought that what this is for sirius held up the decanter of ogden old firewhiskey and clinked it against remus glass remus almost had the glass to his mouth when a loud whoosh from the fireplace startled him into splashing some of the firewhiskey on himself and there before them was rinna as if their conversation had conjured her picking herself up and dusting off her best teachers robes starting without me were you she admonished lightly both men rose hastily to their feet we werentexpecting you rinna remus said quietly sirius crossed to the fireplace and took rinna arm rather formally why arentyou at hogwarts i thought it was a big night oh it was she was pleased she was able to keep the irony out of her voice but this night i d rather spend it with people who who remember them the way i do you know sirius walked her to the couch while remus summoned another glass rinna shrugged out of her robes and sirius solicitously took them and laid them carefully on the back of a chair rinna sat and patted the couch next to her indicating sirius should sit with her she gently placed her hand on his knee she was glad he was here remus resumed his seat across the table in the armchair and filled a glass for the latecomer a long silence filled the room as each person held their glass as if by not saying anything they could keep the anniversary at bay look rinna finally said softly we have to acknowledge it that thirteen years ago we lost our best friends because if we don t it doesntmake it any less true it doesntstop the anniversary from passing remus smiled slightly isntthat what i said last year yes she replied at the time i thought is was bullocks oh thanks so much she interrupted him but now i realize it was very wise and very accurate so what do we do sirius asked remus answered we each make a toast to their memory he raised his glass to james and lily two of the finest people i have ever known you were taken from us too soon and because of that there is a void in our lives that will never be filled three glasses went from outstretched arms to lips sirius cleared his throat he knew that he could be eloquent but not tonight this tradition was too new and too emotional for him to prongs and rosie he said roughly lifting his glass merlin i miss you to my dearest lil and jamesy rinna felt her throat start to close not a day goes by that i dontthink of you her voice became choked with tears sirius squeezed her knee comfortingly and how i should have been there she heard remus make a small noise of protest she knew what he would say and he d be right but it didntstop her from feeling that she d failed her friends somehow she took some shuddering deep breaths and sniffed but i swear that if it is in my power to do so her voice hardened to steel i will not fail you again three heads tilted back as the mourning friends knocked down the rest of their drinks and the coffee table quivered with the impact of three glasses slammed to its surface rinna remained slumped forward her elbows resting on her knees as she studied her empty glass remus tried to catch her eye what was that all about rin remus asked softly what wrong rinna sighed and looked at her friend i ll tell you in a minute remy sirius felt a little pang of jealousy that remus knew her well enough to read her like that and he did not anymore but then rinna leaned back and put her head on his shoulder and his arms automatically went around her and she sighed again sirius held her and rubbed her shoulder soothingly until she finally lifted her chin and said softly to him thanks she used to do that in the old days lean into him as if to absorb some comfort or strength before facing some unpleasant task a feeling of happiness completely at odds with the current situation passed through sirius rinna rose and circled around the room once acting as if she was pacing but really she was unobtrusively sealing the wards to the house before she turned to the two men and said gentlemen i afraid that harry is in need of our help and she proceeded to relate the events of the entire evening it was much much later and cooler heads were finally prevailing thanks in no small part to the seals on the wards preventing any sudden departures before rinna lowered herself to the couch and stretched out her head on the armrest she was emotionally and physically exhausted she listened as remus and sirius schemed and plotted ways to get information to harry but their voices began to grow faint and her eyes felt so heavy she woke to sirius gentle shaking c mon ruby he smiled fondly at her let get you to bed he swung her up in his arms and carried her down the hall to her room he set her gently in the bed and removed her shoes before tucking the covers around her and leaning down to kiss her softly goodnight love leave it to us and get some rest knew i could leave it to you two i mean she mumbled needed the marauder mentality he chuckled and stood up to leave she caught his hand arentyou staying she asked hopefully i didntwant to presume he told her honestly despite what happened last weekend stay with me tonight she squeezed his hand please he smiled at her and dropped a kiss on her forehead i ll be back soon he promised let me just finish helping remus clean up mmmm was her reply and sirius was quite sure she was asleep before he even left the room rinna woke as the first hint of dawn threatened to overtake the skies she groaned and lifted her head off of sirius chest to look at the clock his arms tightened reflexively around her to keep her close do you have to go so soon he murmured i want to be back in time for breakfast so i can talk to harry she whispered sirius peeled open one eye in order to cock an eyebrow at her dontthey still serve breakfast later on sundays at hogwarts rinna nodded so i ll ask you again do you have to leave so soon he wiggled the eyebrow suggestively as a slow grin crept across his face she smiled well i donthave to leave just yet she admitted coyly good he declared and he pulled her mouth down to his the sensation of his lips moving on hers and the patterns his hands made as he traced her curves over her rumpled clothing rather effectively pushed any concerns over her possibly hideous morning breath right out of her head in fact the only things she was truly able to focus her mind on at that moment were the heart stopping look of desire in his eyes and the obvious evidence of his arousal pressed against her you are making me sorry that i didntstay awake last night she whispered in his ear his smoldering eyes crinkled at the corners as he grinned at her i ll make sure you arentthe least bit sorry this morning he informed her with an engaging leer sunlight was slipping through the break in the curtains and throwing tendrils of light on the fine dusting of hair on sirius chest when rinna propped up on one elbow to look at her lover a knut for your thoughts she asked playfully his smile was rueful i thinking of how to apologize for my behavior last night she eyed him a moment oh i think you just did she smirked he opened his mouth but she laid her fingers on his lips to forestall his words i figured you would react like you did but i knew you would come to your senses for harry sake he took her hand from his mouth and placed it over his heart with a gentle squeeze as he caught her gaze and held it he reached up and caressed her face we can do this you know do what she was confused we re going to get harry through this rinna i promise you his eyes never wavered from hers we can be harry godparents finish raising him finally keep our promise to lily and james he watched her eyes widen rinna twined her fingers in his together together love as long as i have breath in my body anything else he was going to say was swallowed by her passionate kiss damn it blackie i hate to leave you but this is borrowed time she finally whispered reluctantly getting up to get dressed she stood for a moment admiring the sight of him stretched out luxuriously on her bed before kissing him soundly on the lips i love you marauder boy he grinned cockily i know she slapped his shoulder lightly pompous git he seized her hand and brought it to his lips your pompous git he corrected looking at her with smoky blue eyes she pulled her hand away lucky me she said and turned for the door to leave before her resolve to get back to hogwarts broke the problem was harry was not at breakfast that following morning neither was hermione so rinna was surprised to see ron there and she noted the sullen look on his face by dinnertime she had learned through the information pipeline that worked so efficiently at hogwarts that harry and ron were no longer on speaking terms the godmother was having conniption fits in her mind trying to ascertain how that could have possibly come about alternating between deep concern for harry state of mind and frustration at not knowing the details of the two friends falling out she simply had to talk to him tonight rinna strategically placed herself where she would see harry as he exited the great hall she smiled and returned greetings from many of the students passing by before she spotted him with hermione mr potter may i have a word she asked in her pleasant professor voice harry glanced at hermione miss granger is welcome to join us if you wish rinna added knowing that anything she said to harry would be repeated to his friends er well at least to hermione hermione gave him a well what do you want me to do look and shrugged her shoulders harry looked from her to rinna and back nah it okay you donthave to stay mione i ll meet up with you in the library sure hermione answered before turning away to the library she shot rinna a disgruntled look as she left harry followed rinna to the windowed portion of the second floor corridor she stopped in front of a window that looked out onto the grounds giving a good view of the lake and the durmstrang ship rocking slightly as the students returning from dinner boarded rinna looked harry over there was no need for preamble they both knew what was on rinna mind how are you holding up she asked with concern i ve been better he answered honestly looking into her worried eyes harry i want you to know that i believe you i dontthink you put your name in the goblet of fire well that would put you in the minority then harry replied bitterness evident in his tone even ron thinks i did i sorry she told him harry shrugged glumly he knew there was nothing rinna could do about ron attitude it wasntas if she was a fairy godmother or anything hermione says that he just jealous that i getting all the attention again rinna was impressed with hermione intuitive assessment and privately agreed with her well i never asked for any attention ever harry declared ferociously and i certainly dontwant it now i know her soft voice was soothing and sympathetic it not fair to you really to have this all thrust upon you rinna harry looked at her with something like panic in his face what am i going to do she knew he was talking not just about his rift with ron but about the whole tournament debacle let walk she suggested i need to tell you something harry fell into step with her i want you to know that you will have help with all of this harry frowned i thought that you weren t i have engaged the services of messrs moony and padfoot she interjected she smiled at him as she saw comprehension bloom on his face really he asked eagerly i just owled si uh mister padfoot this morning to tell him what happened rinna looked pleased he ll be really happy you did harry so what are they rinna held up a hand i not privy to their plans i afraid you will have to wait until they contact you all right harry stopped and chewed on his lip thoughtfully rinna do you have any idea who would put my name in the goblet of fire or why i dunno harry but that is what i am going to be working to find out do you really think someone wants me dead like professor moody said harry asked quietly she gazed at him seriously we already know there is one person who wants you dead harry she said softly whether there are any others we can add to the list next to the dark lord name i dontknow but i ll tell you this her face grew hard as steel they will have to go through me first harry was startled by her words and her vehemence my mum gave her life trying to save me he said softly yes rinna said steadily despite the fresh wave of grief his words brought and you re saying you d do the same he asked incredulously yes she whispered fiercely why harry breathed it was a good question from the moment dumbledore had read out harry name and rinna had been paralyzed in her seat a whole gamut of emotions had been running through her not the least of which was a sudden intense possessiveness of harry there was no way to explain how just a few months of knowing the boy could engender such feeling in her unless it was the knowledge that this was the same person as the infant who d stolen her heart just moments after he was born she closed her eyes and remembered that day the weight of him in her arms and the sudden crazy feeling of needing to kill anyone who would even think about harming the little baby she held what had dumbledore called it maternal instinct what would she do for harry just about anything she realized he was lily son after all just let someone try to rip him away from me a stiletto blade of pain and grief sliced through her heart as she wondered if that had been what lily had been thinking when she had died she opened her eyes and looked at the scruffy kid who had been the downfall of her stonewalled heart because harry lily entrusted you to me and expected me to treat you like you were my own son green eyes locked with green it time i fulfilled her wishes dontyou think author note the quote marked by an asterisk where snape is ranting about harry disregard for rules is from jk rowling harry potter and the goblet of fire

vexed and perplexed disclaimer i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe this depresses me any characters places quidditch stuff situations or spells that you dontfind in her fabulous books well now they belong to me even though the triwizard tournament had begun and the weather was turning colder not one of the hogwarts staff in his or her right mind had even considered ending the highly successful intramural quidditch program there were just too many students bouncing off the walls of the castle in fact professor dunlevy and madam hooch had kindly extended an invitation to professor karkaroff and madame maxime if any of their students were interested in participating rinna was not surprised to see more than the usual amount of spectators in the quidditch stadium on the first saturday morning of november apparently the school foreign guests were investigating rinna was circling and looping on her broom high above the stadium as the players cleared off for lunch she frowned when she realized that two figures were still in the stands they had caused much consternation when they had sat down krum is here viktor krum is watching us play as a result there were several near mishaps and rinna had had to come down hard on the players who were craning their necks and looking at the bulgarian seeker in the stands rather than the players in front of them by the end of the morning rinna had felt like throttling the lot of them including krum and his headmaster so she had shot off into the sky at the end of the session to fly off her frustration and thus ensure her continued employment as she landed on the grass she saw karkaroff and krum were leaving the stands and making their way to the pitch rinna heaved a sigh and strode to meet them gentlemen she greeted in a pleasantly neutral voice masking her irritation how may i be of assistance i am hoping you could be professor said igor karkaroff unctuously viktor here needs to maintain his quidditch skills and i want to set up a time for him to practice without an audience rinna snorted are you not aware professor karkaroff that in the past seven days mr krum has been unable to go anywhere without a small army of admirers following him how do you propose we prevent them from filling the stands repelling charms karkaroff brightened at that i had not thought of that it just might work he said thoughtfully oh for merlin sake rinna threw up her hands i was being facetious professor karkaroff scowled i insist that you accommodate my er that is mr krum wishes certainly rinna snapped as soon as i find out what they are rinna turned to viktor mr krum her tone was kinder what exactly would you prefer for your practice sessions out of the corner of her eye she could see karkaroff fuming at her audacity in usurping his authority over krum hah serves you right pompous self important git for riding on the coat tails of your student fame vell professor viktor said carefully bowing politely to her i must keep up my skills i vill haff to perform vell for my team this spring in order to maintain my contract rinna nodded in understanding but i am afraid it is not very good to practice by myself karkaroff interrupted now viktor you know you dontwant to be giving a free show to all these these children here professor viktor cut in with another bow this time to his headmaster vith all respect i do not care vether or not any of the students vatch i only care about practicing and staying in shape he turned to rinna his face creased in thought in fact professor dunlevy i do not see how i can do that vithout other players rinna nodded ignoring karkaroff splutters impressed that krum had done his homework and learned her name she suspected that karkaroff hadntyet agreed mr krum but this creates a dilemma i afraid she gestured for him to walk with her to the bench at the edge of the pitch she glanced up from her seat when she realized a glowering karkaroff had followed professor karkaroff she said evenly you have my word that i understand the situation perfectly as well as the need for discretion i am confident that mr krum and i can find a workable solution he looked like he was about to protest and i will run it past you before we implement it for your final approval she finished firmly karkaroff looked at viktor who was nodding in agreement before turning his glare back to rinna splendid i am very pleased and gratified that you can help us in this way professor he gritted out in a tone that indicated he was anything but pleased and gratified with how the situation had turned out he turned abruptly on his heel and slunk out of the stadium rinna returned her attention to viktor who prompted you said there vas a dilemma you see hogwarts has four house teams and each team also has three or four reserve players alternate players that is she explained so there are about forty excellent players here she grinned somehow i dontthink even you would be able to play against that many viktor was surprised to realize she was teasing him usually people were very serious with him almost as if they were afraid to offend him and yet this teacher was treating him as if he were a normal person not some quidditch super star he appreciated it very much vell it vould be a challenge he grinned back so i think perhaps he added with a shrug just enough people to make skeleton teams rinna knew what he meant from her days playing quidditch skeleton teams referred to the practice of a team of seven regular players and three alternates forming two teams for practice and drills well that my dilemma you see if i choose just a few players to practice with you we re likely to have a riot on our hands ah viktor said before thinking for a moment vat about rotating the players then it is more interesting and challenging for me to play against different styles vouldntyou think rinna was pleased she had hoped that krum would suggest this solution she d thought he d seemed a decent fellow and she was glad to see that fame had not yet gone to his head i think that is a brilliant resolution thank you for suggesting it viktor gave her a polite bow just two more details to attend to before we can make this happen though first i must check with professor dumbledore he may not be exactly keen on his two champions risking life and limb on the quidditch pitch at krum puzzled look she explained cedric diggory and harry potter are seekers for their respective house teams and second i will have to bring this proposal to our flying instructor for her approval before it can officially happen you are not the flying instructor professor dunlevy krum was very confused now but ven i saw you flying you vere officiating you fly very vell i sorry you got the wrong impression mr krum i have been assisting with our rather new intramural quidditch program because of my interest in the sport but madam hooch who has this weekend off is the person who is really in charge of all things quidditch around hogwarts viktor krum once again smiled widely smiling did wonders for his usually dour expression rinna thought it was too bad he was one of those people whose facial muscles fell into a somewhat surly arrangement at rest vould you be talking about rolanda hooch professor he asked why yes rinna replied a bit taken aback do you know her his smile turned rather impish yes she and my grandfather played for the same team you see rinna looked at him curiously really krum nodded huh professor begging your pardon but i think you are forgetting a third detail krum was still grinning he really looked like a cheeky teenager now it was hard to imagine this was the same man who was the serious bulgarian seeker oh i am am i rinna asked one eyebrow raised in challenge and what might that be vell you did tell professor karkaroff you vould run vatever plan ve came up vith past him for his approval a sour expression crossed rinna face blast i did didnti viktor laughed at her scowl she eyed him speculatively all right mr impudence if you hurry you ll still get lunch i ll take care of my three tasks and we ll have this all worked out in a matter of days viktor stood up bowed to her and left the pitch turning once to wave cheerily in her direction the following friday afternoon rinna moved quickly through the halls of the old castle a small bundle of journals tucked in the crook of her elbow it had taken every ounce of diplomacy and wit she possessed to wheedle the periodicals out of the library and therefore out of madam pince tight control she considered herself fortunate that she did not have any children of her own or she would have likely had to pledge her firstborn to the woman as collateral against the journals safe return as it was she d used up valuable time during this her only afternoon free period and was now hurrying to the dungeons and her latest brewing of her private commission as she had started to call her renewed potions experiment she d commandeered one of the smaller unused classrooms and had implemented an impressive array of wards and lock spells to keep her work safe all which took precious time to do and undo she huffed out an exasperated sigh if she didntget any work done today she d have to use her free saturday afternoon after the morning first official viktor krum quidditch melee as madam hooch was calling it she sighed again usually friday the thirteenth was a lucky day for her it became obvious she had not learned her lesson about taking corners at breakneck speed although she wasnttruly even running more of a barely restrained jog really when she collided with a wild haired sobbing student periodicals went flying and rinna staggered backward recognizing the girl who was crying uncontrollably and covering her mouth even as she reeled from the collision unfortunately her hands reflexively flew out to her sides in an attempt to maintain her balance revealing the cause of her tears hermione oh merlin what happened rinna gasped the girl front teeth had grown and were now past her chin and almost to the point where they were pressing into her breast bone finite incantatum rinna pulled her closer to the wall so her back was to the corridor hermione hands were once again covering her disfigurement and her sobbing continued come on hermione let me see rinna coaxed gently carefully prying the distraught girl hands from her mouth all right she said calmly placing her hand on hermione shoulder we are going to get this taken care of you are going to be just fine okay the poor thing shoulders heaved miserably i taking you to the infirmary i could probably take care of this right here but i not the expert in healing that madam pomfrey is she smiled encouragingly your parents are dentists i believe hermione nodded slightly they would agree that we dontwant an amateur mucking about with something as important as teeth so here you go and rinna produced a clean handkerchief from her inside robe pocket and opened it use this to cover your face she placed the hanky in the girl hand and held it up to her nose like so as if you have a nosebleed that it the teeth had been effectively disguised rinna turned extended a hand and with a quiet accio the journals returned to her she wrapped her free arm around hermione shoulders and kindly led her toward the hospital wing madam pomfrey she called as they entered the infirmary and was surprised to see the healer poke her head out from behind the curtains where she was tending another patient this is our other dueler poppy pomfrey asked incredulously surprised that hermione would break such a serious school rule hermione vigorously shook her head well rinna said carefully she been hit with densaugeo but i dontthink miss granger was dueling in the halls she turned to hermione you weren t were you hermione again shook her head madam pomfrey sniffed well mr goyle here claims he wasntdueling either hermione shook her head a third time he wasn t all right then i will leave it to the teachers to sort this out let get her to a bed over there professor yes right there i ll be with you shortly miss granger we ll soon have you put to rights rinna guided hermione to the edge of the bed well you obviously canttell me what happened right now but i could probably hazard a guess you were hit by a hex gone astray hermione gave a sad little nod something seemed to click in rinna mind oh no please donttell me that harry was dueling hermione looked away rinna sighed one guess as to whom with draco malfoy hermione still refused to look at her rinna pushed aside the privacy curtain rather forcefully and stalked to pomfrey office i nicking a piece of parchment poppy she called as she opened the desk drawer she returned to hermione alcove and set the parchment on the bedside table you re supposed to be in potions right now if i not mistaken rinna said recalling harry schedule hermione nodded i writing you a note excusing you from class you ll need this or professor snape will likely give you detention she handed it to hermione and held her gaze when you ve been set to rights and you can talk again if you want to tell me what happened i more than willing to listen and i ll do my best to help sort things out all right hermione didntknow if she d take rinna up on her offer she wanted to tell her how cruel snape had been after he d looked at her rapidly lengthening teeth and stated he couldntsee any difference in her appearance but somehow hermione didntthink it would do any good it not as if rinna could make snape change his attitude or anything rinna must have seen the conflict play out in hermione eyes and even if i cantdo anything about it hermione i want you to know that you can always come and talk to me she put her hand on hermione shoulder and gave a light squeeze draco malfoy was sitting in the stands of the quidditch stadium nursing a slight resentment that he had not been drawn to play seeker against viktor krum madam hooch had placed every hogwarts player name and to draco disgust every alternate player as well in the lottery to be drawn for skeleton teams to help krum keep up his training of course it was draco luck that the four seekers had fewer chances of being drawn than the rest of the players because of course krum was playing the other seeker the only thing that kept the situation from being completely unacceptable was the fact that neither potter nor diggory had been drawn either if he was going to be forced to watch someone else play seeker when he should have been at least cho chang was easy on the eyes he presumed that all the players who hadntbeen chosen were supposed to feel grateful that they were at least invited to stay and watch krum play if he was honest with himself he was rather pleased that he d be able to brag about watching krum but it would have been far better to say he d actually played with krum he was unable to maintain his sulk however once the players took off he was too busy watching the match he would never pass up a chance to watch quidditch played even he admitted sourly to himself if the only team available to watch was gryffindor s a flash of red caught his eye and he turned his head it was the referee professor dunlevy he didntfind carrot tops all that attractive they reminded him of the weasleys he shuddered but the professor well her hair was a dark rich red it reminded him of the polished mahogany furniture his mother favored that color was definitely appealing he found his mind inexplicably wandering to thoughts of the enigmatic teacher everyone went on and on about how impartial she was and each student was convinced that the professor had hailed from whatever house that particular student was from draco had heard from the sixth and seventh year slytherins that her class was ace and that she really was fair to everyone draco studied dunlevy as she swooped around the players whistle in her mouth he thought about his own experiences with her one thing he knew she was very cunning just look at how she had handled the snake incident she had taken ten points from everyone ten points and had made them all think she was going easy on them and she had duped them into being grateful they had received only one detention draco smirked and nodded in grudging admiration she had handled the entire incident in a brilliant calculating and draco eyebrow shot up in realization as a matter of fact very slytherin manner and the snake incident draco suddenly remembered was where it was revealed that dunlevy was a parselmouth his eyes narrowed how was it that he d almost forgotten that little tidbit of information when st potter was discovered to speak parseltongue back in second year the uproar was such that the walls of hogwarts had practically fallen down around them but when dunlevy skill was discovered it had caused very little comment it was as if everyone seemed to have forgotten that interesting fact about her how curious draco had no doubt it had been intentional on dunlevy part but how she had managed to divert everyone attention from the fact she speaks parseltongue he had no idea but it was a maneuver worthy of a slytherin and besides parselmouths were rather a slytherin phenomenon well except potter of course but he was a freak anyway draco noticed that scarhead was paying close attention to the professor as well he seemed rather intent on her and draco smirked to think that perhaps potter was a little bit infatuated with her as if draco paused to indulge in a new awareness that while dunlevy seemed impartial she had clearly shown her preference for draco over potter and the weasel he had been gratified to note that she had attended or refereed every intramural quidditch game slytherin had had but a few weekends ago when gryffindor had played several matches she had been conspicuously absent but the piece de resistance the biggest slap in the face of the annoying scarhead and his sidekick was when dunlevy had let draco hold her broom she hadnteven deigned to let potter or weasley touch it draco practically crowed out loud it had been so sweet draco eyes followed the professor as she turned tail suddenly and zoomed over to the hoops before zipping back to call a foul whistle blowing she was a damned good flyer for a girl in fact she flew like someone who had played quidditch seriously played for a school team perhaps if i was the captain and i saw her flying i d want her on my team draco scowled there were no girls on the slytherin team she couldnthave played for slytherin unless had there ever been a time when girls had played for slytherin he d have to do a little research on that it would explain why she owned a decidedly slytherin looking broom a broom model that later became the slytherin team broom for a number of years he eyed her speculatively as she rode on her silvery broom dressed in a green sweater and certainly looking the part and found that he wanted to know very badly just what hogwarts house professor dunlevy had been in much to his surprise five shrill whistles sounded indicating the match was over as he wove his way out of the stands he made sure to linger so he could intercept dunlevy she was putting away the last of the quaffles when he sauntered up to her and said you are really good your flying i mean good enough to have played for a team in school dunlevy stood up and gave him a searching look one eyebrow quirked before she smiled and reaching out to ruffle his hair said why draco you re full of compliments this morning she turned away and completely missed the horrified expression on the boy face as he brought his hand to his hair in disbelief it was a very stunned draco malfoy that watched her walk toward the equipment shed who did she think she was a malfoy hair does not get ruffled as if he was a common schoolboy he hastily finger combed his hair into place and slouched out of the stadium he was almost to the exit when he realized that he d spent so much of the match watching that brazen woman he d completely missed seeing krum play draco was in a dark dark mood for the rest of the day rinna smiled as she stowed the trunk in the equipment room she had felt the indignation flowing off of draco in waves the kid was not used to any kind of affectionate touching that much was obvious he took himself much too seriously that one rinna sighed feeling a soft spot for the slytherin he reminded her of the schoolmates she had watched slowly warp under their parents ideologies or through the influence of their peers narcissa severus regulus she had had to sit and watch unable to do anything unable to make a difference back then but not now she decided she was in a position of influence now and maybe this time things could be different grrrraaaahhh rinna slapped down her notes in utter frustration causing the table in the center of her dungeon workroom to shake it was completely hopeless there was no way she would be productive not with her concentration in tatters and her mind on the miserable week that had just passed she sighed marked another friday afternoon as a loss and determined that it was probably not realistic to expect any progress on her potions work until after the first triwizard task was finished she stalked out of her dungeon re set the spells and made her way to her office with her thoughts chasing around in her head rinna was finding it more and more difficult to keep the godmother and the professor separate especially when a rather ridiculous article came out in the daily prophet last sunday a story by an obvious hack journalist by the name of rita skeeter who fancied herself a writer rinna was well aware of the taunts and jibes being tossed harry way especially regarding a made up quote that had harry stating he cried over his dead parents rinna fumed at the insensitivity of the article and harry schoolmates after all no one wanted painful family tragedy displayed for all to see nor the reminder that one was different from one peers she remembered returning to school for her final year whispers following her everywhere and the word orphaned in particular ripping at her battered heart being an orphan made one atypical from the other students and the subject of often cruel remarks intentional or not certainly most of the students at hogwarts had known about harry circumstances but had never given it much thought until the article came out now harry was being singled out once again he was out of the ordinary weird unusual her heart had ached for him as she watched him struggle under it all during the week the godmother desperately wanted to do something but rinna suspected that it would mostly entail the boxing of many students ears so she kept that part of her tightly tamped down the professor meanwhile was very concerned that the whole fourth champion debacle was eroding the inter house unity that hufflepuff gryffindor and ravenclaw usually had and then there was the fact that last friday harry and draco had been dueling in the halls again rinna ran her hands through her hair in worry she wasntquite sure what she could or should do for harry she had written him a note asking if he would stop by her office today after his potions class she sat at her big oak desk and wondered what she would say to him if he did accept her invitation she sure hoped some of that maternal instinct would kick in and give her something brilliant to say she sighed pulled a stack of essays that were waiting to be graded toward her and waited for inspiration to hit harry knocked on rinna office door which stood open in the back of her classroom she looked up from the essay she d been unable to concentrate on and smiled come in harry she invited as she got up and pulled two chairs forward any change in circumstances between you and ron no said harry rather dully as the two of them sat down rinna leaned forward and put a hand on harry knee listen harry i remember a time when your mother and i had a rather large falling out it was awful i felt oh i felt all kinds of things anger frustration loneliness hurt you and my mum had a fight harry interrupted rinna smiled a little sadly a rather devastating row i afraid at least it was devastating at the time what happened harry was willing to bet it wasntbecause one of them didntbelieve the other what was it about well rinna mouth turned up rather ruefully it was over the marauders actually harry mouth opened slightly in surprise would you like to hear about it it might not make you feel any better even if it made him feel worse harry wouldntpass up a chance to hear about his parents tell me he said eagerly before remembering his manners and adding please well to understand the story i will need to give you a bit of background sometime in my fourth year i realized that your dad and his mates were sneaking out at regular intervals and spending the night away from hogwarts i decided that i would find out what they were up to lily called it my marauder obsession it wasntthat i wanted to get them in trouble or anything like that she huffed out a small laugh i liked them all actually and i was friends with remus by that point but your mum realized that i was a bit infatuated with sirius black an allegation i vehemently denied at the time harry laughed your mother did not approve of sirius or my fascination with the marauders at the beginning of my fifth year your mum and dad sixth year i took advantage of my new privileges as a prefect and decided to follow them one night i had figured out the pattern of their excursions but i hadntconnected them with the moon until her voice grew very soft i watched through the window of the shrieking shack as the lads transformed wondering why remus didntas well until the moon rose over the hills her voice trailed off as she lost herself in the memory what did you do harry whispered snapping her back to her story she raised an eyebrow i ran like hell i ran and jumped back on my broom and flew back to hogwarts not long afterward i confronted them and told them what i knew i made a promise to remus and to all of them that i would not reveal their secrets she remembered that evening clearly the confrontation had not come without a price i had to reveal so much to them but the lads vowed to keep my secrets as well so how did you and my mum get into a row harry prompted impatiently she shot him a quelling look i getting there there just a bit more to tell a month later i was patrolling the castle on the evening of the full moon when the four of them came skidding down the halls intent on getting to a secret passageway they knew of to the shrieking shack rinna suddenly looked dismayed realizing that she wasntbeing very circumspect harry grinned it all right i know there are secret passageways from the school rinna looked at him curiously i ll have to find out the source of his knowledge later no doubt it the twins well they didnthave much time before the moon rose and they were being followed by the other prefect who was patrolling that night and nearly were caught they only made it to the entrance to the passage because i created a diversion she saw the question in harry eyes i had only intended to fake the injury but i actually sprained my ankle so the other prefect had to help me to the infirmary it was my just punishment i suppose she rolled her eyes at the memory so the marauders took it upon themselves to send me a box of chocolates as a thank you for my noble sacrifice and do you remember me telling you that sirius would send me anonymous roses by owl harry nodded that was the first time he sent one to me she smiled at the memory before her expression grew thoughtful and that what started the trouble with your mum and me rinna sighed then continued to tell the story to her godson lily was not pleased rinna had been obsessing over the marauders for some time now following them at night trying to figure out where they went off to engaging in verbal warfare commenting on their looks and personalities not to mention having a crush on lupin for a while last year lily was fairly certain that rinna was past that now and currently a fascination with sirius black lily eyes narrowed as she studied black from across the room he was much too full of himself that one sirius legend in his own mind black self styled ladies man of hogwarts what was he playing at lily had no doubt it was he who sent the candy and the rose but why it wasntuntil after classes were over that lily was able to catch rinna privately hey rinna i need to talk with you i know i know what you are going to say lily but the candy wasntfrom black it was from all the marauders rinna began to explain but what about the rose lily crossed her arms and looked disapprovingly at rinna he sure was interested in your reaction to it that makes me think he sent it rinna crossed her arms defensively it could have come from all of them too the gifts came together after all and there was no card with the flower even to her own ears rinna didntsound as if she believed herself lily certainly wasntconvinced just what is going on with you and black is there something you re not telling me you ve been awfully quiet lately lily was struck with a thought hang on why would the marauders of all people be sending you gifts anyway she asked suspiciously oh lil it was just a thank you gift for helping them out with oh rinna clapped her hand over her mouth her eyes growing wide at her near slip lily voice dripped censure helping them with what she knew she should make something up anything but rinna had promised lily she would always be honest with her she wasntgoing to start telling her best friend lies now i sorry lily i canttell you lily felt a jab of pain so rinna was keeping secrets from her she d noticed that her friend had seemed distracted and a little distant and had hoped it was merely rinna adjusting to the demands of being a prefect lily began to notice some strange feelings slipping around her heart and squeezing jealousy betrayal irrational anger you found out what they were up to didntyou she shouted rinna looked miserable i canttell you i sorry but i promised are they holding something against you blackmailing you perhaps rinna shook her head and looked at lily sadly feeling absolutely awful that lily was upset but there was nothing she could do about it she wouldntbreak her word to the boys lily looked at her friend and felt a weird combination of fear infused with anger fear that her dearest friend was pulling away from her anger that it was those particular boys who were the catalyst it ignited the temper she was known for fine then lily snapped go ahead and keep your secrets i see that the promise you made me that we d always be totally honest with each other doesntmean much does it rinna felt like she might cry dontsay that lily would you have me break my word to them lily had two splotches of red high in her cheeks but she looked like she might burst into tears as well i would expect you to behave like the best friend you claim to be she said coldly and turned to walk quickly away before the tears started to spill rinna stood stock still for an eternity it seemed tears trickling down her cheeks reeling from the row and feeling very very wretched she d never fought like this with lily in all the time they d been friends never having really been on the receiving end of lily temper before rinna had a new found appreciation of why others feared her sharp tongue with a heavy heart she turned and made her miserable way to the library how long did your fight last harry wanted to know rinna sighed we didntspeak to each other for a week harry nodded so how did you make up the wistfulness in his tone tugged at rinna heart she knew he had to be missing ron terribly the marauders intervened she smiled at the memory they kidnapped lily and me took us to an abandoned classroom and then she paused for dramatic effect they revealed all the secrets i was keeping for them to lily even professor lupin s she gazed at him steadily even lupin s she said somberly as a result i was freed from my obligation to not tell lily and she could no longer say i was keeping secrets from her her voice dropped low it was a huge sacrifice on their part to salvage our friendship and the happy side effect was it helped to soften your mum opinion of them she smiled at him and put her hand on his shoulder have a little faith harry you and ron will work this out eventually i sure of it i dunno it been three weeks now harry sighed gloomily oh harry rinna exhaled unhappily i wish there was something i could do i wish i could just just make it all better somehow s okay he assured her with a wan smile i know you re not a fairy godmother fairy godmother he started to explain oh it from a muggle story the fairy godmoth i recognize the reference she interrupted him it just that i haventheard it since your mother she trailed off sadly the fairy godmother changed the girl rags to a beautiful gown if i recall so she could dance with the prince and made the glass slippers that she left behind at midnight harry nodded hmmm rinna mused sounds like an awful lot of fancy transfiguration work and not much in the way of problem solving to me harry gave a little snort of laughter no you see the fairy godmother waves her magic wand and makes everything all right rinna pulled out her wand and brandished it above her head showering gold and silver sparks around the office anything harry smiled and shook his head blast it looks like you re stuck with just a plain ordinary godmother then harry looked at her affectionately i just glad i have a godmother he told her sincerely rinna stood up c mere she said gruffly and pulled him into a hug harry felt strangely better although he wasntused to motherly hugs he hugged her back and told her i talking to sirius tomorrow night well early sunday morning actually i know he told me she gave him one last squeeze and let him go are you going to hogsmeade tomorrow she asked him harry shrugged it might help take your mind off of everything maybe he said doubtfully harry stomach chose that moment to rumble loudly and rinna laughed as she ruffled his hair let get to dinner shall we harry nodded and followed her out the door thanks rinna he said quietly she directed a warm smile at him my door is always open harry remember that sunday morning found rinna entering the great hall to nick a bite of toast and some juice before she went for a run the students were starting to get used to the sight of one of their professors in a track suit and trainers so she was usually able to slip in and out of breakfast with very little notice today however she was waylaid by an owl which brought attention to her since there usually wasntowl post on sundays she opened the note expecting it to be from sirius with a recap of his conversation with harry last night it wasn t hi rinna i in the neighborhood on business dumbledore said it would be fine if i wrote you and invited you to visit me we are camped on the other side of the forbidden forest just follow the north edge around and you cantmiss it no one is supposed to know we are here yet though will you stop by today yours charlie weasley rinna frowned charlie here on business charlie business was dragon keeping and if he was here on business that meant there were dragons here and that meant rinna turned abruptly and dashed out of the great hall through the entrance hall and down the castle front steps leaving a few surprised students in her wake she found the path that skirted the forbidden forest with ease and fell into a comfortable running pace dragons the first task involved dragons what in the hell were they thinking it didnttake long for her to round the corner of the edge of the forest as the castle and lake slipped from sight and the enormous enclosure soon loomed into view four magnificent dragon specimens were lounging in the morning sunlight deceptively docile and most likely under the influence of stunning spells and the sight took rinna breath away she stopped and stared spellbound by the sheer beauty and obvious power of the beasts her mouth went dry harry going to have to face one of those she was on the verge of executing an about face running back to the castle seizing harry and taking him to a far away place hong kong australia arizona where can we go but she was hailed by a shout what are you doing here a burly grizzled wizard demanded from the entrance to the compound she jogged forward i looking for my friend charlie weasley weasley the man turned and roared into the camp some bird is here to see ya charlie came sauntering up a wide smile on his good natured freckled face rinna he pulled her into a hug i glad you came he took her arm and led her into the camp to show her around he bent his head and said in a much lower voice i wanted you to be forewarned about first task rinna didntbother to hide her dismay by the moons of jupiter charlie they are going to set dragons on schoolchildren no offense to your father but the ministry has gone effing barmy they had stopped outside the spell reinforced enclosure that held the impressive beasts which looked even larger and more intimidating now that rinna was closer charlie turned to her speaking earnestly look rinna all of the dragon keepers will be on hand to keep the dragons under control and handle any unexpected situations the safety of the tournament champions is the top priority rinna face was pinched with worry what do they each have to do well uh each champion has to remove a special egg from a clutch the dragon is guarding what rinna shrieked charlie shushed her and looked around charlie weasley rinna hissed more quietly but with no less intensity are you telling me that those she waved her hand dramatically at the slumbering dragons are broody females this is insane it going to be a very controlled situation everything will be fine he soothed rinna shot him an exasperated glare you ll excuse me i hope if i start pointing out the hundreds of ways in which things could quickly go to less than fine charlie took her by the shoulders listen to me rinna i know you are worried about harry i swear charlie that if anything goes wrong i will take on a dragon myself but i promise you charlie went on as if she hadntinterrupted flexing his fingers and shaking her just a little that i will not let anything happen to harry i swear it rinna he locked his eyes with hers and she could see the intensity and sincerity there rinna took a deep breath and nodded she turned to look at the four dragons so beautiful she whispered so beautiful and so terrifying charlie turned to look at them too yeah he agreed in an almost dreamy voice he looked back at her do you remember the summer after you graduated from hogwarts how you would take bill and me out into the woods and we d go catch snakes rinna snorted i tried to keep you out of your poor mum hair she had her hands full with percy and the twins each time we found one you would start whispering to it and we would all pretend that you were telling it to behave rinna glanced at him sharply then we would pick it up in our hands and pet it charlie chuckled for years i really believed that you could talk to snakes charlie rinna began uncomfortably my point is it is because of you that at the tender age of five i began to appreciate and even fall in love with animals charlie looked at her again i love what i do rinna i wanted you to know the part you played in that occurred long before you pulled strings and got me that internship at the slovakian colony rinna took a deep breath so he knew about her role in that then thanks charlie she said softly then she grinned but if your mother ever knew that i had that you had influenced my choice of profession she d probably skin you alive that why i never told her what i just told you that rather decent of you rinna gave him an ironic smile and thank you for saying you ll watch out for harry at least that gives me a little peace of mind during all this he bowed gallantly then offered her his arm shall i walk you back to hogwarts thanks but i think i ll finish my run he walked her back to the camp entrance i ll see you when this is all over and dontworry everything will turn out fine i hope some of your optimism has rubbed off on me rinna gave him a hug before looking slyly at him and for the record charlie i really was telling the snakes to behave charlie threw back his head and laughed i know he smirked i finally put it together my first year at hogwarts it was about the same time that i realized that maybe you didnthave cooties after all she cuffed him lightly on the shoulder goodbye you dragon taming git she grinned and began jogging back to the castle thanks to you his reply came from behind her there that the last of em sirius pronounced as he pulled the final book from a box and carefully set it next to the others sitting on the coffee table the black family wasntreally very avid about dragons i afraid i grabbed anything i thought may have a reference remus picked it up and flipped through it interestedly this one may hold some promise but i not sure about the others the whoosh of someone flooing in could only have been one of two people sirius looked up in time to see rinna emerging from the fireplace rinna eyes were dark green pools of worry when she locked onto his sirius the first task is sirius stated at the exact same moment rinna it going to be dragons they finished together rinna stared at him mouth open slightly how did you know harry told me sirius explained apparently he saw them last night oh thank merlin he knows rinna sank into the armchair in relief and proceeded to tell them about her meeting with charlie he promised me he wouldntlet anything happen to harry she finished i dontknow said sirius dubiously charlie is still just a kid how much training has he had with dragons anyway he almost twenty two rinna said a bit defensively and he started training right out of hogwarts with one of the best new dragon keepers in years she caught the rather significant look that remus tossed her way and frowned slightly at him before her eyes widened of course she said softly to herself as she snapped her fingers i ll be right back gentlemen sirius watched her quizzically as she pulled up the trapdoor and disappeared down the cellar steps several moments later she came back into the living room a box levitated before her she set it on the coffee table removed the lid and began rifling through the contents sirius noticed that her cheeks were slightly pink remus beat him to the question what do you think you ll find in there rinna rinna spoke without looking up i know i have some articles he wrote and a textbook he authored a chapter of somewhere in here who what sirius felt like he d missed something when rinna still did not look up but continued doggedly searching the box remus explained the dragon keeper charlie trained with rinna ah convinced him to take charlie as an intern at his dragon colony in czechoslovakia here we go rinna said brightly still a little flushed as she pulled out a small bundle of journals and a book sirius thought that maybe she was avoiding his eyes hang on he said let me get this straight you know this upstart czechoslovakian dragon tamer rinna looked at him carefully you do know that they ve separated into the czech and slovak republics now dontyou donttry to dodge the question rinna she sighed his name is jindrich svorad and the last i heard he had been promoted to manager of the dragon colony in the tatra mountains in north central slovakia she gestured to the journals right now we are looking for any information on the handling of broody she dragons specifically on how to safely remove an egg from one clutch she picked up the book and began skimming the chapters sirius watched her for a moment a strange disquieting thought that there was more to this dragon keeper thing than met the eye scratching away in the back of his mind but his worry for harry well being shoved the thought away for later pondering he began to peruse the first periodical remus who had been strangely quiet was doing the same eventually rinna snapped the book shut in frustration and tossed it back into the box nothing plenty of information on dealing with a clutching dragon but none on removing an egg apparently it is not a recommended practice she grimaced as the clock struck the half hour i need to be getting back to hogwarts she looked despairingly at her two companions what do i tell harry sirius and remus looked worriedly at each other sirius said i tried to tell harry that their eyes were the weakest spot but our conversation was interrupted and i didnteven get a chance to suggest the conjunctivitis curse he was troubled rinna brows rose in interest i wouldnthave thought of that i guess you were paying attention in kettleburn care of magical creatures classes she huffed a small laugh when he stuck his tongue out at her i dontthink students learn the conjunctivitis curse until fifth year remus remarked quietly rinna swore sirius pulled her into his arms moony and i will keep looking for an idea dontworry ruby he kissed the top of her head she snorted right you might as well tell a vampire to stop craving blood she placed her cheek on sirius chest and heaved a big sigh i suppose i ll be pulling an all nighter in the hogwarts library tonight sirius chuckled wish i could join you relive old memories and all that she pulled away and wrinkled her nose at him you never pulled an all nighter in all your years at hogwarts you git oh you were referring to studying he grinned roguishly at her before offering his arm and walking her to the fireplace he pulled her into another kiss this time fully on her mouth and was gratified to feel her arms slip around his neck as she parted her lips and kissed him back finally he cupped her face in his hand everything will be all right rinna he whispered with more reassurance than he felt rinna looked doubtful i hope you are right blackie i hope to merlin that you are right a n sorry it took so long to update summertime is the most hectic time of the year for a single mom i ve decided the fabulous people who reviewed my last chapter when it came out two months ago egad were kerichi coryna

author note here where i give big ups to lorett she is an absolute gem of a friend and we re talking hope diamond proportions here she is my beta for this story and if it wasntfor her and her persuasive ways this story would still only exist in my little ol head the two red heads waved and laughed then blew kisses at harry the cycle began again and he watched it through three times feeling a number of emotions wash over him in rapid succession like gusts of wind whipping at his robes the little voice returned muggle photographs can be altered can wizard ones he tried to dismiss the thought but it tickled the back of his mind like an annoying itch you dontknow this woman at all no one has ever said anything to you about your mum best friend before why would she just show up now he couldntbanish the tickle would you mind opening the boot for me he startled her out of her thoughts all right harry opened his trunk and took out a tiny picture album that reverted to full size once he pulled it from the trunk he ran a hand over it lovingly before opening it hagrid had given it to him at the end of his first year at hogwarts it contained pictures of his parents harry flipped through the photos from their wedding hoping to find the faces of other guests but hagrid had been rather single minded in his quest to give harry pictures of his parents and pictures that did not have lily and james as the main focal point had not made it into the album he found the picture of james and lily laughing with sirius black there had to be a movement caught his eye a movement at the left hand edge of a photo of the happy couple dancing he waited there a young remus lupin twirled a girl in a deep red dress gryffindor red his mind told him but just as he turned her so her face would be visible they slipped out of the frame patiently harry waited and was rewarded when the dancers entered the frame again her smiling face was to the camera her red hair piled on her head in an elegant coif with tendrils hanging down to frame her face and emphasize her big green eyes she laughed as lupin wrapped his arms around her and dipped her when they came up they disappeared from the frame again huh didntknow the professor had it in him mused harry arinna was leaning against the car trying not to look at the pictures but it was no use her eyes were drawn to them like to a gruesome accident scene she was almost nauseated by what she saw but could not look away harry tapped the left edge of the picture drawing her attention she watched as she and remus came into view and again as he clowned around and dipped her a small smile appeared on her face the silly ass she said softly harry looked up at her and saw sad nostalgia in her eyes may i look at this she asked he stepped aside and held the one side as she grasped the other and the next few minutes were spent in silence as they turned pages arinna finally broke the quiet after almost thirteen years the pain should be less dontyou think harry saw the tears that threatened to spill i guessing it not he whispered in half question half statement she sighed and wiped her eyes in my experience no no it is not harry felt a pang of guilt for subjecting her to the painful memories the photos must have evoked i sorry he started for bringing out the album but i needed to know his voice trailed off how could he tell her that he hadnttrusted her even after she gave him the picture of her and lily she looked sharply at him but her voice was kind know what if the picture you gave me was a fake he hung his head in shame i shouldnthave questioned harry now her voice was sharp she took the album out of his hands and turned him to face her she placed a hand on his shoulder and the other hand under his chin and forced him to look at her two pairs of green eyes met and held promise me you will never stop listening to that gut instinct that inner voice or whatever it is that tells you something is not as it seems harry blinked in surprise that is what was going on isntit she pursued he nodded she sighed and turned to lean against the car again crossing her arms over her chest in retrospect i probably was not the best person for the job swooping in unheard of out of nowhere and expecting that screech an owl cry caused both to jump hedwig harry gasped he ran to the back door and opened it and felt the heat that had accumulated inside he pulled her cage out and felt a packet of owl treats thrust into his hand poor thing i forgot it gets so hot in parked cars here let me arinna spun her wand around the bird and a cool breeze began to ruffle her feathers next she conjured some water in a dish hedwig hooted her approval pretty girl do you feel better now hedwig looked her right in the eye and mantled her feathers haughtily hmmm i dontthink i forgiven arinna laughed softly ah she ll get over it harry assured her as he fed his owl the treats after all she spent 3 weeks cooped up in my stuffy room at least as hot as this may i borrow her harry i need to send a note to dumbledore and the weasleys letting them know that i finally managed to wrestle you away from that that those people harry nodded and she grabbed a note pad and a ball point pen from her briefcase harry tried to surreptitiously remove the note he had tied to hedwig leg earlier in his room but arinna noticed what that note about harry blushed and stammered to tell the weasleys i was being kidnapped he finally got out there was a moment of dead silence before she began to chuckle sharp witted more like razor edged harry potter you have the makings of a good auror in you no dontapologize again what did i just say about trusting your instincts her face broke into a genuine smile like the one from the picture she was stunning that i d better not ignore them her eyes were warm and lit up by her smile i say harry if i am ever in a desperate situation surrounded by danger on all sides then i want you and your razor wits at my back she turned to tie her message onto hedwig harry went all warm at her praise two heads lifted in unison to watch the snowy owl fly away a loud rumble emitted from harry midsection tell you what arinna grinned it been a long time but i do remember that teenaged boys are bottomless pits i feeling a bit peckish let go grab a bite to eat i have a lot of explaining to do and i must have sustenance to do it harry grinned back an excellent suggestion miss dunlevy he bowed mock gallantly as he settled into the front seat she placed a hand lightly on his knee and caught his eye harry my friends call me rinna i d like for you to do the same as she pulled the car out into traffic arinna mentally made a herculean effort to pull her scattered wits together the whole scheme had sounded good some ten days ago but it wasntplaying out quite as she had planned seeing that photo album seeing them seeing him pull it together rinna you need to concentrate you ve only been driving for a year driving in the city made her nervous in all honesty driving anywhere made her nervous but failure was not an option for arinna dunlevy and having decided three years ago to experience the unknown to her anyway muggle world she embraced it with as much enthusiasm as she could muster well that sounds much prettier than the truth said a tiny voice in her mind ruthlessly she clamped down on the seditious thought but not before it added more like fled the wizarding world to the decidedly unmagical one rather than face rinna pinched herself behind the knee shut up she bellowed silently to herself really rinna you ve got to stop listening to yourself she snorted the irony that that was exactly contrary to what she told harry he should do was not lost on her the sound of her snort pulled harry out of his own reverie sorry did you say something no but this would be a good time to name your poison what exclaimed a startled harry rinna mentally whapped herself upside the head bloody brilliant just rile up all his suspicions again keep this up and you will never be allowed on another rescue mission she squashed down any further thoughts including the one that stated she really needed a shot of fire whiskey about now i meant what do you want to eat you choose anything you want oh whatever i want she nodded harry broke into a grin pizza harry took a bite from the slice of pizza sucking in air to cool the food as the hot cheese threatened to take a layer of skin from the roof of his mouth i not one for sweet drinks rinna was saying but these fizzy ones arentso bad soda harry corrected her as he drank said beverage in an attempt to salvage his mouth deciding it was prudent to let the food cool he studied rinna with curiosity rinna how old are you she almost choked and replied harry dontyou know it is bad manners to ask a lady how old she is harry felt relaxed and happy for the first time in a long time and some impertinence was breaking through i sure i am not sitting with a lady considering the language i heard you use not long ago he said in a supercilious tone while grinning cheekily what i quote effing bastard really miss dunlevy such language is not befitting a he was interrupted by rinna shriek of laughter that has got to be the best imitation of minerva mcgonagall i have ever heard she gasped out laughing so hard she was teary well she is the head of my house he replied with no attempt at wiping the impudence from his face whatsoever when the laughter died down he continued you just dontlook old enough you know to be friends with my mum i was two years younger than her actually harry frowned a little how did that happen then becoming friends when you are so far apart in age rinna paused certainly to an almost fourteen year old two years was a big gap but it hadntseemed so to her and lily well two things happened to bring that about really rinna was surprised at how little pain she felt she hadntspoken of lily to anyone in so long she had thought it would be rather agonizing for her to do so the first was i entered hogwart a year earlier than most children do harry looked surprised so she explained my magical gifts manifested quite early there was a need for me to develop discipline sooner rather than later oh and the second well i was so precocious in some areas that at the beginning of my third year i was put in fourth year potions the same class that lily your father siri uh all the marauders were in wow harry was impressed he thought about hermione using the time turner last year she certainly would be considered precocious his heart gave a little pang at the possibility of losing her if she was advanced to the next year but wasntthat hard on you to leave your friends and go to a group of strangers actually i didntreally have friends i was very insecure my first two years and shy then i started to realize i was academically at the top of my year and by the beginning of my third year i was much more confident and something happened to me what happened harry was intrigued i developed a backbone an attitude and opinions it really was a bad combination actually quite volatile no one in the potions class wanted an ickle third year telling them in minute detail exactly where they were doing wrong in the brewing but i couldnthelp myself i was tired of being the quiet one i was a little social nightmare and became quite put upon by my classmates she cringed at the memory harry nodded he certainly could not see anyone in his class tolerating such insolence from a youngster he felt sorry for the young rinna and he prompted she looked into harry eyes so much like lily s ouch the pain finally manifested and yet it wasntso bad when she could say it to lily eyes your mother was a very compassionate person she felt sorry for me and took me under her wing and saved me from the social hell i was unwittingly creating for myself she stood up for me and most importantly she loved me for who i was it felt like picking at a scab you had better stop now before you pull away the protective covering and become a bloody mess harry wanted to talk with her forever he really craved any information any description of his parents he wondered about himself was he like them was his temper more like his mum or his dad s which side did his sense of humor come from but most of all although he did not consciously realize it he wanted some kind of confirmation that they would have been proud of him arinna dunlevy had stepped into his life today and provided some small bit of the enlightenment he desired he wanted more and you were friends ever since not trusting herself to speak at that moment rinna merely nodded her head so you knew my dad and sirius and professor lupin too right uh oh said the protective part of her mind dontgo there if you open too many wounds you could bleed to death the picture from harry album of sirius laughing was seared into her mind well she hesitated unwilling to open a line of discussion that she simply wasntprepared for at the moment of course i knew them the uh the marauders were quite well let just say infamous at school i dontthink there was a student there who wasntsubjected to their high jinks at one time or another harry eyes lit up but were quickly sobered at her next words and we will talk about them harry she glanced around a bit nervously but later this isntthe time or the place to do it harry lips pursed and quirked to the side he sighed a little exaggeratedly and very grumpily okay rinna nodded one bullet dodged harry eyes lit right back up uh oh she could almost see the questions queuing up in his sharp mind waiting to be flung at her and she could feel her spirit running at a dead sprint behind its brick wall not wanting to answer them oh but you can talk about my mum right harry went on undeterred was she smart was the boy part terrier rinna felt like a fox in the hunt cornered definitely she got high marks in all her classes ancient runes arithmancy and transfiguration were her best subjects did she like quidditch harry did she play on the house team was she a good flyer like my dad harry once again the tone in her voice made him stop harry a bit less sharply lily was like a sister to me her voice dropped very low when she when she died it was like a part of me had been amputated she dropped her head in her hands and ran her fingers through her hair she looked up into harry eyes i sorry harry i thought i could do this i thought i d be able to tell you what you wanted to know but i haventreally spoken of her since since that night it is more painful than i expected even after all these years but you are the first person i ve met who was my mum friend not my dad s his voice had a slight edge to it a touch of desperation mixed with annoyance he ran a hand through tousled raven hair and rinna watched fascinated just like james just like him rinna cringed and looked away she didntwant to see the look in his eyes at the moment she just wasntready yet harry would have to wait until she could battle these feelings and get them under better control i understand that i do her voice became steady and firm that it rinna regain control of the situation my girl you want to know about your mum and i want to tell you about her really i do but you are going to have to give me some time her assessment of his face brought one word to mind sulky well that certainly better than desperate and annoyed besides we really should discuss our plans for the rest of the day and i dare say you would be interested to know what dumbledore and company have in store for you the rest of the holiday hmm harry brightened with sudden hope ron had mentioned having harry stay at the burrow and the weasleys said something about tickets to the quidditch world cup she dangled the morsel of information in front of him yes harry pumped his arm in the air rinna smiled to herself at his quixotic change in mood and you ll be staying at the burrow for the rest of the summer harry did a few dance moves in his seat and she continued i thought that before we went there tonight for dinner we could go to the cinema as a treat harry had never been to the cinema as the dursleys had never seen a need to take him he d watched movies on the telly but wondered what it would be like in a big theater as this was an opportunity not to be missed he pushed away the disgruntled thoughts at having been thwarted in his quest for information about his mother for now he smiled at rinna that would be cool in the darkness of the movie theater she tried to collect her thoughts when she had woken up that morning on 23 july arinna dunlevy had thought she had a pretty good idea of how the day would play out and now looking back she realized that not a single quaffle had gone through the hoop her strategy had been sound so what had happened something had obviously upset her game it had started with that album she hadntbeen prepared to see everyone she loved looking so carefree and beautiful and alive that what had started the mortar crumbling and then harry questions and his eyes hungry for any tidbit about his mother dontneed to use veritaserum on me oh no just put harry potter in front of me and i ll spill my guts till i pass out from the pain well that had begun the breaking of the bricks and then more questions tearing at that place in her heart that she thought was dead that she had tried to kill her fingernails dug into her palms as her hands became fists in anger she had spent almost 13 years carefully constructing the fortress around her heart an impenetrable wall made from bricks of determination and denial and cemented by discipline and torment and for what to have the wall start to crumble so quickly so innocently so effortlessly because of a stripling wizard a mere slip of a boy well she needed to regroup pull herself together rebuild she sighed new game plan think about how to give harry the information he wants no needs without causing further damage to yourself she couldntput it off for long rinna knew that sooner or later he would need to be told her eyes slid closed at the thought harry needed to know about lily about james about his godfather and about rinna promise to harry that she had been unable to keep rinna wondered and not for the first time that hot summer day just what exactly she d gotten herself into a new definition of family chapter 21 the yule ball disclaimer i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe and i confess to breaking the 10th commandment by coveting them any characters places charms situations dress shops or spells that you dontfind in her fabulous books well they belong to me with a few notable exceptions which will be referenced at the end of the chapter warning this chapter is full of romance and silliness it simply had to be done ooo nymphadora tonks set the small cage with the owl down on the coffee table and approached the tall man who was looking out the back window she wondered if remus lupin had any inkling what a scrumptious picture he made when he was contemplative with his lean body reclined against the window frame his face relaxed except for the small vertical crease between his brows and his generous mouth slightly open somehow she doubted it she slipped behind him and ran her hands up his back before he turned and caught her against him wotcher remus where is my lothario cousin a slow smile of admiration spread across remus face as he studied the woman in his arms her hair was dark tonight but in keeping with the theme of the christmas holiday she had added green and red streaks her eyes were green to match in her heart shaped face and they were crinkled in the corners by the smile she was gracing him with he found himself marveling not for the first time that this chameleon enchantress would look at him like that he had met her the day he was helping rinna move some things into the flat the girls had just rented that is he d met her again for the first time as an adult he d immediately been attracted to her but didntreally read anything into it after all he d felt the exact same thing the first time he d seen rinna in almost ten years and really he was just a man reacting to the visual image of an appealing woman of course he continued to find her alluring but two criteria kept him from examining that any further she was rinna flatmate and therefore off limits and she was quite a bit younger than he was the sharp snap of fingers in front of his face broke his reverie are dreams of sugar plums dancing in your head professor tonks teased i asked you where sirius was sorry he apologized but his expression was more roguish than remorseful i thought for a minute that a christmas angel had invaded the house she laughed as he wiggled his eyebrows at her in answer to your question he attempting to make himself presentable she ran her hands down the front of him admiring his black slacks and shirt i think i like the dark gothic hero look on you she observed it makes me want to hurry and get to the woods so i can snog you in the dark he raised an eyebrow you would skive off lookout duty just to satisfy your base cravings he asked in mock horror hmm good point i guess i ll just have to snog you now then remus grinned well if you must she brushed her lips against his and whispered oh i must before kissing him soundly so what were you thinking about so intently when i came in you me what about me she asked playfully well i was thinking that it was one month ago tonight that you let me lead you into my room and and have your wicked way with me she finished for him with a cheeky smile as she settled her arms around his neck comfortably he wrapped his arms more firmly around her waist and pulled her closely to him you make me out to be so dastardly he noted the look on her face was reminiscent of a cat that d gotten into the cream he chuckled but then sobered and that how some would view my intentions toward you you realize she studied his face seriously because you are a werewolf not just because i a werewolf you know because i much older than you because i am poor it would be construed as corrupting and taking advantage of an innocent na ve maid idiots all of them she said fiercely you are not that much older than me and you are employed for heaven sake besides i am hardly an innocent and na ve maiden she smirked then and if anyone is in danger of being taken advantage of at this moment my dear remus it is you she pointed upward toward the ball of mistletoe she d suspended over their heads with a silent wingardium leviosa before pulling his mouth down to hers he decided to let the topic drop for now after all it was christmas eve who was he to spoil the holiday spirit especially when her lips were so sweet and warm and tasted like hot apple cider he slid his hands into her hair and deepened the kiss well i see tonks has arrived drawled an amused voice from the hallway tonks reluctantly pulled her lips away from remus and gave him a smoldering look that held promise of more to come later before looking at her cousin who d sauntered into the living room she gave a low whistle sirius teased see something you like cousin tonks tossed him a cheeky grin i just thinking that rinna is finally going to believe in father christmas after she sees what he bringing her tonight sirius laughed ever the practical one remus asked are you sure about this padfoot it not without risk you know and rinna may not be in a position to play along that why i ve asked you two to act as lookouts you ll figure out some way to divert any ministry officials with you two at my back the risks are practically non existent sirius grinned winningly looking every bit the part of the dashing rascal and furthermore rinna has never been able to resist the temptation of an illicit rendezvous tonks looked between the two men and felt like she was getting a small taste of what it must have been like to hang out with the marauders in their heyday well he has managed to elude capture all this time you know and who better to have watching his back than us she really had no worries about rinna participation once she figured out what they all were planning remus nodded and he been a dab hand at the covert l affaire du coeur for quite a while he noted besides he did clean up rather nicely it d be a shame to let all that hard effort go to waste sirius ignored his friend jibing so what are we waiting for he demanded eagerly ooo rinna smoothed down the satin of her gown and shivered in feminine delight at the rustle of long skirts she was forced to admit that she d had fun getting in touch with the girly part of her and playing dress up a few weeks ago when she and tonks had gone dress shopping at madame malkin s and even tonight as she d dressed and transfigured some jewelry and put jeweled clips strategically in her hair she d enjoyed herself although she had felt a bit melancholy as she remembered the excitement and giddiness associated with the dances she had attended as a schoolgirl she sighed the night would be filled with bittersweet memories she knew she was lurking in the entrance hall which was beginning to fill with students in fancy dress robes keeping an eye out for her godson and his fellow gryffindors she wanted to see how handsome he would look in his dress robes and make sure they were straight and calm his nerves if she could and admire what a nice looking couple he and parvati patil would make and try to tame his unruly hair with some spit on her fingertips my stars i getting all motherly just the thing to completely embarrass a fourteen year old steady rinna girl no disgusting displays now keep your cool it was a good thing that she d just made her resolution for at that moment her quarry came around the corner she had staked out dean thomas seamus finnegan with lavender brown ron and harry and parvati and every mothering instinct in rinna began screaming inside her she took a calming breath before she hissed quietly ron weasley get over here the group stopped right in front of her the boys eyeing her up and down looking gobsmacked normally she d have been a little irritated at the cheek of fourth years ogling her but she was more horrified by the sight of ron robes dear merlin did he take a butcher knife to the collar ron she said calmly i need to speak with you for a moment over there where it quiet she indicated they go around the corner to a small alcove off the hall parvati do you mind if harry comes too i ll keep him only a moment she flashed a winning smile at the girl who murmured her acquiescence rinna practically dislocated the arms of the two boys in her haste to the alcove for the life of him harry could not think of what he or ron had done that they were being hauled off to a corner like recalcitrant preschoolers ron looked at harry with wide uncertain eyes as rinna spun him to face her sweet mother of morgana she muttered appraising his apparel we have got to do something about these robes they re ghastly both boys relaxed as they realized that the maroon monstrosity masquerading as dress robes that ron mother had bought were what had rinna in such a state i know i tried to get off all the lace and frills with a severing charm ron moaned miserably well said rinna crisply this wontdo at all i will not have any cousin of mine looking like a tatty old couch if i can help it cousin ron looked confused rinna regarded him tartly surely you remember that we are third cousins ron on your mother side she almost laughed at his expression he had forgotten this wont take long she said and lifted her skirts to expose a black high heeled shoe and a shapely calf strapped snuggly to her lower leg was a leather sheath which held her wand she pulled the wand out noting i glad this is a long skirted type of affair i hate having this blasted thing strapped to my thigh she straightened and glanced at the two boys their eyes looked like they were going to pop out honestly if she d known that dressing up would have this effect on the male half of the teenaged population at hogwarts she d have worn an uptight victorian cut robe like mcgonagall all right hold still she told ron as she circled around him muttering transfiguration charms tugging here and there smoothing the shoulders and sleeves of the robes until she was satisfied huh she grunted as she stepped back to observe her handiwork a bit darker on the color and there that is much better if i may say so myself the robes were a very dark burgundy and cut in a classy style with elegant black trim they fit ron well and made him look less gangly than usual wow nice job fairy godmother harry said cheekily to rinna but the impressed look on harry face told ron all he needed to know i want to see he said eagerly rinna laughed and obligingly conjured a large mirror which she held in front of him bloody hell ron breathed oh sorry he apologized as he lifted his flushed happy face to rinna didntmean to swear it just looks ruddy fantastic rinna laughed again it all right ron she cocked her eyebrow at him and told him with a wicked grin i sure the girls will be falling all over themselves to get to you you look abso bloody lutely handsome ron flushed and ran his hands appreciatively down the front of his new robes the mirror disappeared with a small pop as rinna turned to harry you look rather dashing too harry nostalgia swirled in her eyes you remind me so much of your father seeing you all decked out like this she shook her head and smiled at him i just wanted to tell you that you will do fine out there you have a natural grace that will serve you well and you wontbe in the spotlight for very long harry gulped nervously at the thought of dancing in front of all those people uh thanks i think rinna studied him for a minute still smiling before saying to herself damn but i canttake it she realized she d spoken aloud when harry looked at her quizzically harry i promised myself i wouldn t but seeing you looking so she broke off and tried again so i am probably going to embarrass you and i sorry but just let me do this and get it out of my system and we ll never speak of it again or maybe even laugh about it in ten years it came out in a rush harry had a sudden heart stopping moment as she stepped up to him when he thought she might kiss him so it was a great relief when she merely licked her fingertips and used them to try to smooth down his hair she stepped back and smiled sheepishly all traces of the professor gone she was at that moment his adoring godmother and he felt his heart swell at the affection she d shown he grinned at her sorry she said quietly i ll try to better behave myself the rest of the night he smirked impudently why start now he quipped eyebrows raised in wicked challenge what is that any way to speak to your godmother you cheeky scamp she said in feigned outrage and cuffed him gently on the shoulder get back out there you your date is waiting ron and harry grinned and moved back toward the entrance hall then harry turned around and said seriously you uh you look beautiful rinna ron murmured his agreement and the two boys flashed smiles at her before making their way into the crowd of students rinna chuckled those two were well on their way to mastering the trademark marauder smile ooo harry was relieved when the first dance was over and he practically dragged parvati back to the table where ron and padma were sitting at least he hadntmade a complete ass of himself out there rinna had been right speaking of his godmother harry noted that she was politely extricating herself from the clutches of ludo bagman he had managed to commandeer her for the first dance harry was distracted by a voice very close by i telling you it would be a shame if she is stuck dancing with old men all night or worse dancing with snape or karkaroff harry swiveled his head around and noticed a knot of sixth and seventh year boys and their dates talking it was cedric diggory who had spoken who else is there for her to dance with it seems her beau didntshow up said a tall seventh year ravenclaw that so sad said cho chang she looks so beautiful too harry peered in the direction they all were looking and realized they were talking about rinna he didnthave to return his attention to the older students to know who was talking next he recognized the voice of lee jordan you know what has to be done gents we cannot in good conscience allow such a fair flower to be a wallflower now can we what do you propose asked the ravenclaw boy harry remembered that he was lisa turpin brother why we all should ask her to dance said fred weasley there was a general cacophony of startled voices until fred raised his voice a little not all at once but one at a time all of us blokes we can cut in one after the other and show the good professor that we appreciate her and at least maybe she will have a good time for a few minutes what angelina johnson said and just what are your dates supposed to do in the meantime we want to dance too c mon angelina lee wheedled it only for a song or two and you should applaud us for being chivalrous and courtly and all that coming to the rescue of a damsel in distress somehow professor dunlevy doesntstrike me as the damsel in distress type angelina noted with a snort but the other girls shushed her it only for a few minutes said cho and i think the boys are being awfully sweet in the end a good number of upperclassmen lined up from all houses even some slytherins and a few lads from durmstrang and beauxbatons as word of the plot to make sure professor dunlevy got to dance spread around the room rinna glanced around the great hall watching as students began pairing up and stepping out to the dance floor half paying attention to what hagrid was saying about the care of the magnificent beauxbatons flying horses the rest of her mind was preparing herself for a rather uneventful night of small talk making nice among the staff and visitors and she had drawn the lot for a mid evening patrol of the rose garden on the front lawn she sighed in relief at that knowing that there were likely to be snogging couples by then but it would be too early yet for any truly inappropriate behavior thank merlin mcgonagall and snape had the late patrol and as far as she was concerned she was more than happy to let them have the reputation of prudish killjoys she smiled a bit nostalgically thoughts like those made her think of dances past and snogging in private corners of gardens with a certain marauder she sighed and found herself missing sirius terribly and it was a shame he wouldntsee her in this dress she was certain he d have appreciated it she d worn a dress almost the exact same color to the dance at the end of her fifth year she smiled and tapped her foot in time to the music as she imagined the expression on his face if he could have seen her coming down the marble staircase excuse me professor dunlevy rinna musings and hagrid ramblings had been interrupted by cedric diggory rinna smiled at him what is it cedric she asked kindly i was wondering if uh well if you would like to dance rinna regarded him bemusedly i beg your pardon i asked if you might like to dance cedric repeated with an uncertain smile she really hadntconsidered this possibility she glanced at the other female teachers did students ever ask them to dance somehow she doubted it what should she do she gazed at cedric who was looking at her hopefully and thought why not after all this might be the only opportunity to dance any more tonight she smiled at him and said it sweet of you to ask cedric i d like that very much it didnttake long for rinna to figure out what was going on she d been dancing with cedric for less than a minute when george weasley cut in and laughingly twirled her he was followed by lawrence turpin from ravenclaw lee jordan fred weasley rastislav tsvako of durmstrang adrian pucey of slytherin eventually rinna estimated that at least one third of the upperclassmen boys had spun her around the dance floor for a few seconds this isntgoing to go on all night now is it she laughingly asked geoffrey abbott a sixth year hufflepuff as he stepped in to take his turn geoffrey grinned winningly oh no professor we just thought it would be a shame if someone as striking as yourself werentseen on the dance floor or worse if the only place you were seen was on the arm of some old geezer rinna current young gallant was startled by a harrumph and a tap on the shoulder i hope you wontmind if this old geezer cuts in mr abbott cer certainly not sir the hufflepuff boy stammered and bowing he relinquished rinna hand to the headmaster of hogwarts dumbledore eyes were merry as he waltzed rinna around it has been a very long time since hogwarts has had a young unmarried and if i may be so bold as to say so radiant looking female teacher i d quite forgotten what kind of affect such a person had on the male students rinna blushed slightly and smiled if i to believe what i was told their intent was rather gentlemanly and thoughtful ah yes saving you from the clutches of the old geezers dumbledore expression was pure mischief it appears i have foiled their plans then rinna laughed but minerva felt it best if i come rescue you apparently the fourth and fifth year boys not wanting to be outdone were planning to take over where the upperclassmen left off rinna eyebrows went up oh merlin then thank you hang on did you say that minerva thought i needed rescuing well dumbledore explained with a sly smile she remembers what it was like being the only young unmarried and radiant female teacher at the school dance rinna head swiveled around to peer at mcgonagall in her red tartan dress robes and her thistle wreathed hat she imagined her younger much younger and smiled do you mean to tell me the boys werenttoo intimidated to ask her to the dance floor she queried her partner chuckled and told her in a conspiratorial tone one young man asked her on a dare i believe and after that why they were afraid not to ask her she was smiling so much rinna laughed as the music ended and dumbledore walked her off the dance floor she wondered if it had been a dare that started her own stint as the belle of the ball and if the motives were purely for the purpose of sucking up to her or were they nobler as her young squires had claimed whatever the case she d had fun and found that really she cared not one iota about motives at this point it would be fair to say that a good many of the fourth and fifth year boys who had gathered informally near the punch fountain to plot to take over for the upperclassmen were rather disappointed to see professor dunlevy leave the dance floor but harry wasntone of them he had had quite enough of dancing for the night thank you very much although dancing with his godmother might not have been so bad rinna was glad to use her thirst as a pretext to escape the boring small talk she politely made her excuses and turned for the punch fountain where she d seen the fourth and fifth years gathered she smiled and greeted students as she made her way admiring dresses and brushing off compliments she could feel the underlying excitement as the teens waited for the weird sisters to launch into the loud raucous music they were best known for she was near her destination pleased that she would be passing right by harry so she could compliment him on pulling off the first dance she had just caught harry eye when an elegantly clad young man wearing black velvet dress robes with a high collar and looking very much like his father at that moment moved to intersect her route and inclined his blond head draco malfoy was feeling rather cheated he would not get to dance with professor dunlevy he knew that she would have been impressed because after all draco was a fine dancer he would have given her a proper turn around the dance floor unlike those other oafs his eyes searched for her and widened as he saw her coming toward him maybe he could make a good impression anyway excuse me professor he said smoothly stepping slightly into her path with a small nod of his head out of the corner of his eye he saw potter frown draco smirked inwardly but put on his best dazzling smile professor dunlevy may i say that you look exquisite this evening he was pleased to see potter scowl deeply and turn rather red this was going to be fun he took the professor hand and brought it to his lips in a gallant gesture he d seen his father execute many times if slytherin green wasntalready my favorite color it certainly would be now harry seethed as he looked at rinna gown it was green it was a rather attractive color on her it certainly wasnt slytherin green he scoffed to himself was it of course not that idiot malfoy didntknow what he was talking about slytherin green indeed it was really more of a well it reminded him of okay it was some other shade of green of that he was sure draco casually self assured demeanor and his i know i can make the girls swoon smile were very reminiscent of the teenaged sirius which of course reminded rinna that draco was related to her lover he the son of a black that smarmy charm oozing out of his pores must be a genetic trait her lips curved into a smile rinna chuckled and gently pulled her hand from his grasp why mr malfoy does your mother know what a charmer you are turning into her light tone held the slightest bit of reproof rinna couldnthelp but smirk when pansy parkinson looking remarkably like a pink thundercloud latched possessively onto draco arm i hope you and miss parkinson have a wonderful evening she told them and moved toward the punch pansy was hissing at draco like a crazed goose but she flounced off in a huff at his quiet clipped reply george and fred who d witnessed the entire exchange decided to take advantage of the fact that malfoy was not accompanied by his two goons and actually was the only slytherin in the vicinity to teach him a lesson they moved forward each twin catching one of draco shoulders with their own knocking him over fred solicitously grabbed the front of draco robes to help him up while george warned him in a low voice oh ho she way out of your league ferret the flick of george eyes toward the punch table left no doubt in draco mind which she the twins were referring to draco seethed as fred made a show of smoothing down the lapels of draco robes sorry bout that he said loudly no harm done the twins walked away leaving draco to glare at ron and harry before realizing that he was among mostly gryffindors he pulled himself up haughtily in an attempt to regain his poise before he turned stiffly and walked away reminding ron of a cat that had gotten unexpectedly wet the altercation had taken very little time at all and most who were not in the immediate vicinity had no idea what had just happened ron turned to harry in glee didja see that he asked but was disappointed to realize that harry was distractedly looking at his godmother hey mate you all right ron asked in concern harry was not all right malfoy words had disturbed him deeply he turned to his best mate and voiced his troubled thoughts ron what color would you say rinna gown is what ron asked incredulously her dress what color is it ron sputtered harry are you telling me that you missed seeing fred and george take the piss out of malfoy but harry was already brushing aside ron comment he d seen hermione and krum strolling off the dance floor toward the punch fountain he dashed up to hermione and tugged at her elbow mione can i speak to you a moment he smiled nervously at viktor it wonttake long he pulled her aside what the matter harry hermione queried breathlessly when she d seen the determined look on harry face as he pulled her away from viktor she d been sure that harry was about to reveal that he d realized he d made a huge mistake in not asking her to the ball and would she please leave viktor to dance only with him she couldnthave been more wrong much to her dismay look at rinna harry demanded in a low voice what color would you call her dress robes hermione jaw dropped slightly this was what harry wanted to discuss his godmother dress you pulled me away from my date to ask me that she was clearly not pleased i would call that color green harry she peered at him closely you know she said a bit nastily it not uncommon for males to have red green color blindness maybe you should have that checked out she huffily pulled her elbow away from his hand and returned to viktor harry instantly realized his mistake hermione wasntthe kind of girl who went dotty over things like ball gowns he looked around for someone more qualified to answer his question lavender brown was standing conveniently near parvati so harry strolled over in what he hoped was a casual manner and stopped in front of the girls parvati looked up hopefully but harry did not ask her to dance again instead he asked lavender to describe the color of professor dunlevy gown parvati pouted as lavender began to talk enthusiastically professor dunlevy looks absolutely smashing in that color doesntshe it brings out her eyes she could wear just about any shade of green really with her coloring even mint green although the yellowy greens wouldntbe very complimentary chartreuse for example harry head began to reel and he murmured his thanks as he turned away parvati grabbed him harry do you think that i should have worn a green dress uh no he told her your dress looks fine it really um pretty that color he took her by the elbow to lead her to the table where ron and her sister padma were sitting harry wasntterribly upset when a boy from beauxbatons asked parvati to dance shortly thereafter fred and george came by and seized the empty seats next to harry we got one over on snotty ferret boy didntwe harry fred asked did you see it it was poetry a work of art george added we ll teach him to get cheeky with the g m wontwe harry nodded absently but then he turned to them with hope on his face you two are pretty observant dontyou think of course they answered in unison nothing gets by you right right was the twins simultaneous assurance good harry was going to try a different tactic so look at the g m a minute he grinned as their heads moved together to comply now would you say her dress robes are more of a grassy green or a uh a leafy green two incredulous faces turned back to him uh harry said george only girls make up names for colors like that you feeling okay yeah should we be concerned mate fred added you re not taking a sudden poncey interest in women fashions are you no no harry hastily reassured them the two lads shrugged and left to find their dates harry sighed in frustration i just want to know what color rinna dress is harry muttered ron leaned over anxious for his friend you keep asking that question what answer will it take for you to stop asking that question harry when someone assures me that there is no way in hell that arinna dunlevy would be wearing slytherin green ooo rinna sipped her punch and observed the goings on in the great hall with much interest everywhere she turned the drama that was teenaged romance was playing out be it coquettish looks or huffy pouts giggling girls gossiping or boys bracingly slapping their mates on the back hearts pounding nervously or hearts shattering into a million anguished pieces her eyes found hermione and krum on the dance floor and she was entranced hermione looked beautiful and rinna had been secretly rather smug at the attention she had garnered when she had entered the hall on viktor arm and her escort had eyes only for her hermione kept glancing shyly up at him and blushing a smile crept slowly across rinna face there was romance budding here she d bet a thousand galleons on it her smile grew wistful and she found herself once again missing sirius she searched for harry and found that he was sitting and watching hermione and viktor as well an odd expression on his face actually his gaze moved back and forth between that couple and cedric diggory dancing with cho chang but it also sought her out a few times and he always frowned when he looked at her until he saw her looking back he waved covertly she could sense that harry was rather vexed by something that seemed to be bothering him surely he hadntinterpreted her dancing with the older boys as being disloyal to sirius more likely she thought he was fuming at the cheeky presumption of draco malfoy at any rate he was obviously not one of the giddily happy attendees tonight and neither was ron by the expression on his face as hermione went to sit with the boys after the song ended he was scowling and alternating between petulant and outraged as he spoke with hermione she left in a snit as did ron date but ron didntnotice that he watched hermione intently and his heart was an open book on his newly transfigured sleeve harry may have been confused about his feelings for two different girls but ron was clearly jealous of hermione being with krum rinna closed her eyes for a moment and remembered her fourth year back when matters of the heart had that sense of life and death urgency she d been boy crazy then torn between crushing on one marauder while finding herself very confused about her feelings for another she snorted and smiled it had been the year of awkwardness and angst and yet in spite of it all she had survived she had no doubt her favorite current fourth years would as well a small owl flew into the transformed great hall and landed on the back of a chair near rinna before turning its round eyes on her and hooting softly it extended its leg politely a note obviously attached for me rinna queried surprised the owl hooted again apparently in the affirmative leg still outstretched rinna took the note and the owl immediately flew off the sender wasntexpecting a reply then curious she opened the parchment i think you should come outside it read in familiar handwriting rinna eyes grew wide he couldntpossibly be could he she closed the note and opened it again no change she spoke a decoding spell over it it remained the same she surreptitiously glanced around to see if anyone had taken notice of the owl then looked at the note once more her heartbeat had broken into a staccato rhythm a silly little smile had spread across her face and her stomach had turned all fluttery sirius was inviting her to a clandestine rendezvous just like in the old days except back then if you were caught sirius wouldntbe facing the dementor kiss her brain which apparently was abstaining from frolicking in the physiologic mayhem the note had wreaked on the rest of her body reminded her she crumpled the note in her hand of all the impulsive dangerous risky rash things to do showing up here like this when ministry officials and all sorts of people who would be very happy to have britain wizarding world most wanted man captured were milling about rinna felt her breath quicken in irritation at the brash actions of her lover well he is acting very much in character for sirius her mind pointed out calmly and she couldnthelp the tiny smile and snort still it wasntgoing to stop her from giving him a piece of her mind didnthe realize that the thought of losing him again made her feel very panicky and quite nauseous rinna schooled her features to a pleasantly neutral smile and decided she would start her patrol of the gardens a wee bit early it was remarkable really how many emotions and reactions in her body that man could evoke with a single sentence even as she stood at the top of the lawns and scanned the grounds she alternated between giddiness at seeing her lover i ll get to dance with him and fury at his reckless behavior the impetuous git she frowned eyes roaming the landscape once again and tried to reason out the most likely place he d be ah ha she spelled her heels to muffle her footfalls as she glided toward her chosen destination and the arms of her sweetheart a low bark and a rustle of sound she d long ago associated with an animagus transformation indicated she was near and suddenly there he was dressed in the fine wool slacks and silk shirt she d bought for him as an early christmas gift looking drop dead gorgeous a dangerously sexy smirk on his lips he raked his eyes over her appreciatively and gave a low whistle ruby you take my breath away with a flourish of her wand rinna executed silencing warming and concealment charms in quick succession before planting her hand firmly on her hip and raising her eyebrow at her grinning beau sirius black what in the name of merlin were you thinking coming here like this there are probably warning spells against you all over this castle you could be caught you could mmpff sirius had closed the short distance between them gathered her swiftly in his arms and silenced her decisively with a fiery kiss all the half formed words of her tirade jumbled to a screeching halt in the back of her head as the sensuous movement of his lips on hers flooded her synapses with scold stopping sensations her arms slipped up to twine around his neck as she deepened the kiss and they spent the next few minutes pressed impossibly close to each other while their tongues and lips danced rinna he murmured eventually as he cupped her face in his hand and gazed at her affectionately dontwind yourself up so tightly i ve been in correspondence with dumbledore and he informed me that all the warning charms against me that were placed last year have been disarmed tonks got an untraceable owl for me to use and i came with remus and tonks who are acting as scouts even as we speak he grazed his thumb lovingly over her lips so you see i not behaving as rashly as you think i am this is a well thought out well executed venture his lips quirked lopsidedly i have learned a few things the last thirteen years you know she smiled at that relief evident in her eyes is that so have you learned impulse control blackie she asked mischievously twirling her fingers in the hair at the nape of his neck he chuckled when it comes to you i afraid not he said with not quite convincing regret good rinna pressed her hand against his head and drew his mouth toward hers their world was narrowed to the soft sounds of the weird sisters playing in the distance and the whisper of lips on skin and the rustle of hands brushing across clothing the music changed as the band moved into a slow set and sirius looked up from where he d been tracing the edge of the bodice of her gown with his lips he stepped back and took her right hand with a devilish smile and a courtly bow he brought her knuckles to his mouth and said may i have the honor of this dance miss dunlevy rinna smiled and tossed her chin coquettishly why mr black it would be a pleasure and she placed her hand on his shoulder as he grasped her firmly at the waist it didnttake long for the memory of years of practice to return to their limbs as sirius and rinna danced on the flagstone path in the remote corner of the castle grounds the soft shuffling of feet and the low peals of laughter were muted by charms as the two secret lovers danced once again under the stars at hogwarts eventually the music changed once more to the fast rhythms preferred by most of the teens but rinna remained with her head resting on sirius chest arms wrapped around his shoulders and her wand in her left hand glowed softly over his shoulder to illuminate their little corner of the world sirius cheek and chin were resting on the top of her head and one hand was on the small of her back while the other lay on the exposed skin between her shoulder blades the two of them swayed slowly to the music lingering in their heads until finally with a sigh of regret rinna pushed out of his embrace i sorry blackie but i have to go patrol the grounds she said with a moue of disappointment the change of music you know what about it he wondered donttell me you ve forgotten she grinned wickedly all those students who just got very hot and bothered dancing so close to their sweeties are going to be searching for places to make out and you are going to go and spoil their fun he shook his head and clicked his tongue i think becoming a teacher has turned you evil her chuckle was fiendish oh yes you have found me out i drunk on the power i have to make groping teenagers jump out of their skin as i pass by whilst loudly clearing my throat sirius threw his head back and laughed so you ve perfected your mcgonagall act then they grinned at each other reliving the same memories his hand drifted to her cheek as he leaned in to kiss her lightly are you sure the kids will be snogging so soon the night is still young his voice was hopeful and the kisses he kept dropping onto her lips were very very tempting she sighed and patted his cheek as she ducked his last kiss unfortunately i sure she tapped her temple with her index finger the key is to think like a horny teenager blackie she informed him a salacious leer crossed his face as his eyes swept up and down her gowned form oh believe me i am he assured her and he reached out to run the back of his knuckles down her neck across her collar bone and over the swell of her breast outlined in green satin he felt her breath catch and he pulled her in roughly for one last passionate snog before reluctantly letting her go i ll see you tomorrow he whispered huskily mmmm she acknowledged as she ran her palm down the front of his shirt mimicking what he d done to her you ll be seeing much more of me tomorrow was her dusky promise an appreciative growl escaped sirius throat as he bent over her hand to kiss it once more rinna stepped forward onto her tiptoes and placed a light kiss on the corner of his mouth thank you for making this evening wonderful sirius she whispered sirius released her hand and stepped back smiling anything for you love rinna watched as the large black dog melted into the shadows and padded away hugging her arms around herself against the cold night air that pushed through the cancelled charms she re worked the warming charm and turned back to the castle and her neglected patrol she smirked she found she was rather in a mood to be lenient toward any furtive little t te t tes going on ooo a n first of all i know that in goblet of fire the yule ball took place on december 25th it suited my purposes more to borrow from the movie and have it on christmas eve instead just me invoking author privilege of using artistic license it is an alternate universe story after all secondly again using the au trump card i have corrected an injustice i have long rallied against namely poor ron having to wear hideous second hand dress robes i mean come on couldnthis brothers who as sixth years must have had some transfiguration skills by then have taken pity on him i think it was very cruel of jkr to have done that to a poor boy of fourteen he scarred enough as it is so in my story ron got the dress robes he deserved too bad he was still a prat to hermione and third i have to give credit to kerichi for the term abso bloody lutely which i borrowed shamelessly from her i just love it and wanted desperately to use it thanks to kerichi sj lorett buffyandspike 4ever siriusrulez sara coryna the scary girl next door and sophia loren for the marvelous reviews last chapter hugs and smooches to you all and now

chapter special thanks to my lovely beta lorett who agonized with me over many portions of this chapter until i had them just right love you dearest harry watched his godmother wrap her scarf once more around her neck as she stood in the frigid air on the hogsmeade station platform and hastened students onto the hogwarts express she had revealed the plan for christmas day to him yesterday morning she took platform duty so she could apparate home directly from hogsmeade harry was to be picked up at king cross station by the weasleys and go home with them sirius and rinna would join them at the burrow for dinner and finally harry would go home with his godparents that night he was grinning like an idiot in anticipation rinna clapped her gloved hands briskly come on come on i say i ve seen flobberworms move faster than you lot the sooner everyone gets on this train the sooner everyone gets home for christmas she called out impatiently yeh heard th professor hagrid roared no more minglin now get on the train thanks hagrid i suppose i in a bit of a hurry rinna grinned at the large man hagrid glanced sideways at her yer beau sure is a lucky bloke arinna he mumbled she smiled even wider and her cheeks flushed deeper i ll be sure to tell him you said so that is if we ever get off this thrice cursed platform harry hermione and ron had moved close enough to hear this exchange before hagrid began taking long strides toward the front of the train what got the g m knickers all bunched up this morning ron wondered in a low voice think about it ron harry replied how many hours are there between now and dinner at your house ron frowned in concentration dunno seven or eight i guess so what is so important that she is in such a hurry he saw harry raise an eyebrow knowingly oh ron gulped oh that he snickered hermione rolled her eyes honestly you two get your minds out of the gutter here she comes happy christmas you three rinna said brightly happy christmas they chorused back well i guess we d better get on that train ron said loudly wouldntwant to keep anyone from getting to anything important now would we oh ronald hermione huffed in exasperation as she grabbed him by the arm and pulled him toward the train stop being such a prat she hissed as she tugged him along rinna watched them go a bemused look on her face before turning back to harry i ll see you in a few hours then harry nodded thank you for the photograph harry said to her quietly touching the flat box wrapped in shiny red foil with a green bow tucked safely in the inside pocket of his robes right next to the penknife sirius had sent him it had been among the presents located at the foot of his bed that morning inside was a piece of folded parchment dear harry i afraid you will have to wait for your present until this evening well the main present that is but i didntwant to leave you empty handed on christmas morning love rinna harry had looked in the box and found a small silver picture frame the photo inside was of his parents his dad was kissing his mum while holding a sprig of mistletoe above her head i took that picture the first christmas after they were married she smiled i think i put a copy of it in my album did you see it there an impudent grin spread across his face oh yeah i seem to recall that it was hidden in there among the pictures of you and a certain someone enthusiastically snogging under the mistletoe enthusiastically snog rinna jaw dropped in reaction to his audacity all right you laggard get your sorry bum on that train this instant as you so impertinently reminded me i have far better things to do than stand on this freezing platform and take your cheek her smirk took the bite out of her words harry suggested under his breath yeah like some serious snogging as he walked by her and onto the train he turned and grinned at her and gave her a little wave she raised her eyebrow at him before looking around the platform for any more stragglers hagrid was getting the last of the other students on the train she turned to make her way to the end of the platform where she could safely apparate she hadntmissed harry play on words yeah i going to go home for some sirius snogging among other things she gave a farewell wave to hagrid shouldered her bag and disappeared with a pop just as the train pulled out of the station sirius is waltzing with rinna in his arms she is dressed in green satin and drinks him in with her green satin eyes he tightens his hand on her waist pulling her closer and she opens her mouth and starts to sing lullay thou little tiny child bye bye lully lullay sirius smiles it has been a long time since he has heard her sing soon a strange sound intrudes on the dance a rapid staccato thudding that is not in time with the waltz he frowns and pulls her closer but the rhythm is lost and the dance falters and woe is me poor child for thee thud thud thud thud thud thud for thy parting neither say nor sing thud thud thud thud thud thud bye bye lully lullay thud thud thud thud thud thud sirius eyes opened rinna is home his brows pulled together in a frown and just what the hell is she doing in the kitchen sirius leaned against the kitchen doorframe and ran a hand through his tousled hair and he watched rinna her back to him as she methodically chopped vegetables and began another carol for one brief surreal moment he felt like his world was spinning this picture of domesticity reminded him of what he d dared not think about in azkaban but now although he wasntfree completely he was free to hope again i want this i want the dream i want her as my wife it not polite to ogle a lady you know the song had been replaced by her teasing voice but the smooth movements of her hands continued sirius chuckled true however i would argue that i am not ogling a lady i happen to be ogling the heartless hussy who is standing there breaking promises she made barely twelve hours ago he pushed away from the doorframe with his shoulder and moved toward her as she laughed he stopped just behind her and allowed petulance to color his voice i fully expected to find you naked in the bed when i woke up you know she tossed him a glance over her shoulder i know but you were sleeping so soundly i didnthave the heart to wake you she smirked wickedly it the only time you look like an angel when you re sleeping sirius slipped his arms around her and pulled her back against him as he kissed her cheek and whispered does that mean the rest of the time you find me devilishly handsome rinna set down the knife and snaked her hand around his head pulling his lips to hers you re damned right i do she reached for the knife again now let me get this done so i can devote the rest of my day to you and fulfilling any promises i made last night sirius grinned in anticipation as he placed his hands on her shoulders and squeezed stars ruby when did you replace your muscles with rocks he began to massage her ooooh she stopped what she was doing and let her chin drop forward probably some transfiguration assignment gone awry nice try but i believe the subject you are teaching is d a d a he gripped her shoulders and turned her around to face him a concerned look on his face my theory is you are doing too much and not taking care of yourself properly she smiled ruefully guilty as charged i guess some things never change he resumed kneading the muscles from the front this time but he looked at her sternly you ve probably been hunched over that potions experiment you re working on for dumbledore she nodded likely not taking any breaks she nodded again but looked into his face eyes dancing oh but i ve made some good progress her expression was so eager sirius couldnthelp but smile and i think i ll be testing it soon he stopped her mouth with his hand i dontwant to hear it not now he watched her brows come together right now i want you to come to your room so we can take care of this properly he gave her tight shoulder muscles a squeeze to make his meaning clear but i want to finish this she protested indicating the vegetables she had chopped sirius pulled his wand out of his pocket with a flourish the remaining vegetables were chopped and all were sealed in a bowl and floating to the refrigerator later he said firmly taking her hand to lead her out of the kitchen how did you when did you she sputtered in surprise he grinned i ve been taking lessons in household y spells from moony so i could pull my weight around here now come on he tugged her through the living room rinna eyed him tartly you like bossing me around dontyou he turned around and took both her hands in his walking backwards while leading her into her bedroom with a roguish smile you have no idea he smirked and then as if to prove his point he added now take off your jumper and your shirt she pulled her hands from his and placed them on her hips playfully oh ho i see what going on this is some elaborate ploy to get me naked isntit you scoundrel he hooked his arm around her waist and pulled her against him giving her his most rascally leer really rinna do you think if i wanted you naked i d have to resort to shenanigans such as these spurred by his proximity her heartbeat increased she recognized the old black arrogance from their school days only back then it had hidden insecurities whereas now it stemmed from a cocky confidence in their relationship she tilted an eyebrow at him and her voice was sultry no i think all you d have to do is give me that smoldering look you are wearing he abruptly let her go which smoldering look he strode toward the bathroom his words trailing behind him i have to go see so i can memorize it and use it on you later rinna laughed sirius returned with a bottle of body lotion he stopped in the bathroom doorway when he saw she hadntmoved ruby are you planning on being the least bit cooperative she looked at the bottle in his hands and cottoned on to his intentions oh yes she lifted her jumper over her head and crossed to the bed i planning on being extremely cooperative blackie she stripped off her shirt where do you want me well that a loaded question if i ve ever heard one baby he chortled at her unintentional double entendre she stuck out her tongue he pointed to the bed on your stomach please with your head here at the foot of the bed he watched as she settled on the bed her head resting on her crossed forearms and took a moment to admire her nearly bare back i hope you dontfall asleep he commented as he climbed on the bed and sat himself carefully on the backs of her thighs his knees on either side of her hips if i do take it as a testament to your wonderful hands she suggested lifting her head up and turning to grin at him and then feel free to wake me up with those wonderful hands he unsnapped her bra pushed it aside and began the massage your wish is ever my command my lady after a while she stopped grunting or hissing in discomfort at each sore spot he came across and sirius felt the muscles finally begin to relax he lavished them with attention and noted her breathing had slowed considerably at long last he leaned over her and said softly in her ear time to turn over love mmmm she mumbled he got off the bed as she reluctantly complied so good blackie i not done yet he informed her making a concentrated effort to not get distracted when her undone bra slipped off exposing her bare breasts with the dusky pink nipples hardening as they met the cooler air of the room he took an arm and began working on it all the way to her hand before laying it on her belly and lifting the other arm finally he crouched at the foot of the bed and ran his fingers along her scalp soothingly rinna was teetering on the fence between wake and sleep when she heard him ask are you sleeping ruby mmmhmm she felt the bed move as he clambered back on it and then felt him stretch out next to her she lazily opened her eyes and saw he was watching her his head propped on his bent elbow his smile tender and possessive that was lovely she whispered thank you sirius traced the line of her collar bones fingers trailing over satiny skin and he found the small lump in the center of the right one a barely perceptible evidence of a long ago healed fracture he leaned in to kiss it and felt the vibration of rinna chuckle feeling nostalgic are you she teased admiring your handiwork he looked at her i just remembering the day that happened and i had nothing to do with the collar bone as you recall i was the one who dislocated your other shoulder she smiled at him a lazy sensuous smile that made his heart skip a beat what i remember about that day is you swooping from out of nowhere and catching me and saving my life she lifted her hand to his cheek my hero he grinned at her before his face softened a bit i spent a good amount of time after i escaped prison trying to pinpoint the moment when i actually fell for you he noticed her frown at his mentioning azkaban well i had a lot of time on my hands while i was hunting for wormtail and thinking of you was how i spent most of it like picking at a scab it was painful and yet felt good at the same time do we have to talk about her words stopped as he lightly placed his fingers on her lips shush i trying to be romantic here he chastised gently rinna rolled her eyes right because being compared to picking at a scab is so romant shut it he growled and he kissed her deeply to ensure her compliance are you going to let me speak without interrupting he asked gruffly she nodded her head brushing her lips up and down across his as she did so he kissed her again hungrily greedily skillfully before pulling away slightly and whispering good as he resumed tracing the lump on her clavicle with his hand he propped on his elbow again and watched his fingers move over her skin i never was able to settle on a moment or an event when i knew i had fallen in love with you i actually think that you started getting under my skin from the moment i met you but i do remember the day that i realized that i wanted to do whatever i could to make sure i never saw your face in pain again he looked into her eyes then and saw that they were glistening he caught a tear at the corner of her eye with his thumb before it fell and then stroked her face with his hand it was that day the day you fell in the quidditch match sirius blue eyes grew distant with memories i was close enough to hear that bludger slam into you and i heard the bone crack and when i turned you were already off your broom and i watched your hand miss as you grabbed for the handle he took a deep breath rinna listened fascinated to his description of an event that in retrospect had been so seminal to their relationship she felt more tears spring to her eyes and was annoyed at her emotional lability sirius continued i remember how it felt when your shoulder wrenched as i caught your wrist i couldntget you to the ground fast enough then you were lying on the pitch blood trickling from your lip where you d bitten it in pain and i think that my heart actually stopped i really do they took you away and i was so worried that i d hurt you that i d broken your arm and pomfrey wouldnttell me anything he made a little growl of vexation i was a mess and james he d figured it all out long before i did but that was the day i had realized that my first thought of you was no longer about the next prank or the next scathing retort she blinked away moisture and caressed his cheek as a wicked little smirk teased the corner of her mouth but they were a close second werentthey he grinned well of course my day was very bereft of pleasure if i didntengage in any verbal warfare with you he chuckled it was shameless really the way we flirted course i was gobsmacked when james and remus finally convinced me that it was flirting he continued to trail his fingers on her neck as she laughed but in the end sirius continued more somberly i wasntable to keep you safe from hurting was i only foolish boys think they can single handedly keep the ones they love from suffering and pain tears were trickling readily down her cheeks now but she smiled and told him you did far more than you will ever know you may have literally saved my life that day but you did so figuratively many times more long after that bone had healed her voice was hushed and full of love he took her face in his hands and wiped her tears and kissed her gently her arms slipped around him and she buried her face into his neck holding him tightly as if she feared he d disappear he held her to him whispering endearments his hand rubbing soothing circles on her back eventually she lifted her mouth to his ear and murmured sirius make love to me so this is what christmas is supposed to be like harry thought as he sat in the warm glow of the living room happily stuffed full of christmas dinner a slice each of pecan and pumpkin pie and sipping on a glass of butterbeer rinna was standing at the liquor chest and mixing drinks by request she d even done something to the butterbeer he wasntsure what but it made it taste a little more well christmas y harry sipped and smiled appreciatively the adults molly and arthur sirius who had an empty seat next to him for rinna and charlie were seated on the couch and the comfortable armchairs the teens were sprawled on the great rug except for ginny who had perched on the armrest of charlie chair percy had begged off after dinner stating he needed to go back to work molly had not been pleased and bill had remained in egypt christmas music was playing softly on the wizard wireless the scent of evergreen was in the air and a fire was crackling merrily on the hearth from the moment rinna and sirius had flooed to the burrow harry had carried this feeling of happiness in his heart rinna had looked much more relaxed than she had at the hogsmeade platform he noted with a smirk sirius looked so very different from his wanted posters that harry quite thought no one would ever recognize him unless they had known him before azkaban that is they had each had a hug for harry and rinna had swiftly bussed his cheek sirius had thumped him on the back it had been perfect now after an amazing dinner the living room was full of chatter and laughter everyone looked like they hadnta care in the world harry wished he had a camera so he could capture the moment and savor it rinna returned to the couch handing molly a colorful drink that fizzed before setting herself down next to sirius and snuggling a bit closer to him that made harry grin happily tell me about the yule ball molly said to the kids on the floor as she sipped her drink oh mum ginny exclaimed enthusiastically you should have seen the great hall it was amazing harry and ron exchanged disgruntled looks neither of them wanted to talk about the ball and neville and i practically danced the entire night ginny paused breathless with her rushed exposition molly turned to harry what did you think of your first wizarding ball harry dear uh well ah i didntdance much just the opening dance he mumbled and i say he did a smashing job of it molly rinna interjected warmly fred and george hooted with laughter yeah more likely he did a job smashing parvati patil toes george snorted harry protested indignantly i did not step on her toes he swatted at george who scrambled out of range now if you want to hear about the person who really cut up the dance floor mum fred continued blithely ignoring harry and pointedly looking at rinna you should ask about which professor danced the most last night a hint of pink brushed rinna cheeks as sirius turned to her an eyebrow raised you danced last night ruby mischief flashed in his eyes i think the real question here rinna announced is who were the masterminds behind the upperclassmen backed plot to make me dance my feet bloody everyone laughed as rinna described what had happened the night before with a grin on her face having had rinna as a teacher for the last few months did not seem a deterrent for the twins teasing her now george smirked and said to harry isntit nice to have your sweet godmother back instead of that tetchy professor we left at the hogsmeade train station harry laughed ron added a bit scary that professor was rinna straightened up indignantly i was not george pitched his voice higher to imitate her get your slow lazy backsides on that train before i hex you all into the flobberworms you so closely resemble he made a few flourishes with his hand as if casting hexes with an imaginary wand i did not say that rinna protested half laughing and half scowling ah but you were thinking it fred waggled his finger at her and dontthink that none of the students noticed either ginny giggled you should have heard why the girls thought you were in such a hurry there were a number of the theories as to the cause of your snappish temper that circulated around the train rinna fred added steepling his fingers and sounding suspiciously like professor binns lecturing on the goblin rebellions the prevailing hypothesis was that you hadntseen enough of your beau the night before george explained so you were in a hurry to he stopped at the startled look on rinna face harry noticed rinna frown and that sirius had tensed who saw me with my beau last night rinna voice was taut fred smirk faltered a little at her tone well everyone did at her quizzical expression he explained all the students are assuming that you are seeing the bass player for the weird sisters what after the ball ended you went up onto the stage and took the bass player by the arm fred reminded her and you were whispering to him george added and then the rest of the band gathered around you and hid you from sight no one really saw you leave the great hall you know ginny finished meaningfully there were a few stunned moments before rinna burst out laughing i went up there to ask if the band would give me an autograph she managed to get out she turned to sirius i knew dorrie would love to have a signed picture of them for christmas she looked back at the smirking teenagers and now everyone thinks yep said fred happily you did bound up there rather eagerly i wanted to catch them before they started packing up sirius chuckled should i be jealous rinna after all you ve always seemed to have a thing for band members when she started to object to his comment he added if i recall you were quite infatuated with the lead singer of the hobgoblins back in the day she sniffed huffily that because he reminded me of you you git everyone was laughing now this does make a nice little cover story for you rinna both you and sirius you realize arthur noted with a smile and it makes you the coolest teacher ever at hogwarts charlie added grinning widely dating a rock star rinna made to protest but sirius caught her hand arthur is right no one would suspect that you would be seeing me if you had a rich and famous bass player on your arm rinna didntlook entirely convinced but let herself be persuaded to not debunk the rumor well i need to remember to look at that autographed picture to find out the name of my beloved bass player i suppose she added as an afterthought donaghan tremlett charlie informed her he shrugged i a fan of the weird sisters too hang on sirius began thoughtfully i thought you gave the autographed picture to tonks for christmas rinna smirked at him oh i did i gave her her copy i kept my copy for myself she jumped up from the couch and wrinkled her nose at him playfully and i going to hang it right next to my full sized poster of what s his name from the hobgoblins on my wall at hogwarts saucy minx he accused as he reached for her she sprang away to the liquor cabinet i mixing the next round she announced loudly any requests sometime later rinna quietly slipped out to the back porch for some fresh air and peace someone had put up a warming charm to stave off the chill molly saw her through the kitchen window leaning against the balustrade and went to join her harry is under the impression that you think i would not approve of him going to stay with you and sirius for the holidays rinna was taken aback oh brilliant now why didnti tell him to keep that information to himself i just thought do you really think that i dontapprove of you and sirius molly raised an accusatory eyebrow rinna frowned actually nothing in molly behavior tonight had indicated that at all er well we re not married the other eyebrow went up i am aware i believe there are extenuating circumstances are there not feeling like a stammering teenager rinna blushed and pointed out and we are sleeping together molly smirked actually smirked i had assumed that was the case hang on molly i remember distinctly standing on this very porch after you caught me and sirius making out in the old shed and telling me that i should not be quote engaging in any of those kinds of activities until i was properly married ah understanding blossomed in molly mind and you thought a rueful look crossed the older woman face she took rinna hand and led her to the old wicker love seat rinna you have to understand i was absolutely terrified she saw the puzzled look her former ward wore there i was suddenly responsible for a sixteen year old girl whose parents had just been murdered charged with keeping her safe until she could return to school you were so lost so angry so needy rinna was amazed and that terrified you i never knew you were always so so together well i had to be didnti molly snorted nevertheless i had a feeling that you two were er involved sexually mother instinct i was fearful that you d end up pregnant and ruin your chances of finishing at hogwarts and that it would happen on my watch so to speak and if that happened i would have let dumbledore down she sighed so i d hoped to put the fear of merlin in you after a thoughtful silence rinna asked so your views on sleeping together before marriage underage teenagers should not be having sex molly interrupted emphatically you were too young rinna rinna bowed her head softly so molly had to duck her head to hear she said i may have been young but i was never innocent my father saw to that molly nodded suspicions from long ago finally confirmed she squeezed the younger woman hand and held it they sat in silence the cheerful sounds of the family gathering inside drifting faintly over them finally molly said you should know that i am very happy for harry that he finally has a family to call his own and spend the holiday with rinna leaned her head sideways to rest it on molly motherly shoulder he a messed up kid molly like i was i hope i do as well by him as you did for me her soft spoken words both confession of fear and oblique compliment brought moisture to molly eyes she reached her hand around rinna head and pulled the girl temple to her lips you will do just fine dearie i have faith in you harry lay back on his bed hands tucked behind his head and surveyed the room his room with satisfaction after flooing home from the weasleys christmas night rinna and sirius had walked him to this room and flung open the door grinning with anticipation the walls had been completely blank the bed had a nondescript quilt and there was nothing on the desk in the corner the room was barren and boring harry had looked at them with an odd expression when sirius and rinna had chorused happy christmas harry then rinna had explained that although he would share the bath that connected to the other room with remus lupin and that had been a surprise to harry the bedroom was completely his to decorate as he pleased she had promised to begin with the transfiguration spells and whatever else was needed first thing in the morning it was a room of his very own a gift from his godparents and it was ruddy fantastic ron was stretched out on the other bed the first thing harry had requested from rinna much like harry was he was surveying the new color on the walls and the various quidditch team posters that had been placed around the room hedwig cage and the golden egg from the first task were on the desk along with the photograph of harry parents i think the heidelberg harriers look better over there mate he noted they balance the holyhead harpies out that good harry yawned i think rinna was getting a little tired of me changing them all about his godmother had been very patient and catered to his decorating whims even five days later when ron had finally arrived to spend some time visiting before the new year eve party rinna had decided to throw the next night a soft knock was followed by his godmother face poking in is everything all right harry raised himself up on his elbows why wouldntit be he wondered rinna smirked well it been at least thirty minutes since you requested a change in the d cor i was getting concerned very funny harry grimaced you know if i was allowed to do magic outside of school that i would change it myself he added a little defensively of course i know that harry she stepped in to the room and looked around and i dontmind really i just taking the mickey you know that she smiled at them both i came to tell you that lunch is ready she laughed when on cue both boys stomachs growled audibly after lunch harry took ron down to the one place he hadntyet seen the cellar the day after christmas he explained to his friend he had woken late but no one had seemed to be around the trapdoor had been open and he d made his way down the steps to find rinna involved in some kind of odd workout sirius who was watching her put a finger to his lips and signaled harry over how d you sleep sirius had whispered fine harry hadnttaken his eyes off his godmother she doing some kind of martial arts isntshe he d asked but isntthat a muggle thing ron asked him remembering a conversation with seamus finnigan about ninja fighters how does she know how to do that sirius told me she learned it from her stepfather harry pulled out the amulet she d given him before the first task i told you about him yeah dragon slayer right well i guess she practiced what he taught her ever since you know to keep fit and as a way to honor his memory ron frowned but seamus said martial arts are muggle harry sat down on the squishy floor mat in rinna makeshift dojo and ron followed suit that what i thought but i guess that only in western culture in the far east sirius says muggle and wizard culture isntas separated as it is here there this thing called chee or something and it like a force that in everyone but wizards can tap into it better i dontreally understand it but what i do understand is many strong powerful asian wizards are also masters of martial arts you know physical warriors as well as magical ones blimey ron breathed then he smirked i dontknow if i should be impressed or scared what are you talking about harry asked a little irritated impressed that you got all that out without garbling it up or scared that you sounded a lot like hermione harry swung his arm out and caught ron in the chest knocking him backwards git ron reached up and pulled harry back by the collar a small scuffle ensued before the boys ended up on their backs laughing so does sirius do the martial arts stuff too ron asked nah he said he just likes to watch her do it there were a few seconds of silence before the boys both snickered sure he does ron noted then he threw his arms up over his head where they landed on the mat in a double thwap he snorted i cantsee myself ever falling so hard for a girl that i d be willing to just sit there and watch her do stuff he stated definitively harry was about to open his mouth and point out that ron had many times been caught staring stupidly open mouthed at fleur delacour when she was eating but then realized ron might say the same of him eyeing cho chang so he wisely kept the observation to himself whatever mate harry heaved himself up to sitting speaking of hermione harry saw ron startled look we were speaking of hermione just before this he reminded him oh yeah right speaking of hermione rinna has invited the grangers to the new year eve party tomorrow ron sat up and nodded good that good he declared before adding under his breath at least she wontbe coming in with krum on her arm harry snorted but wisely said nothing preparation for the party wasntnearly as tedious as harry and ron feared it might be in fact the boys were rather enjoying themselves watching sirius and rinna work the spells that would enlarge the living room of rinna cozy house the two of them worked well together despite or perhaps as a result of the teasing banter they engaged in harry was particularly gratified that the adults would consult the two boys every so often and really took the boys suggestions into consideration and they were learning quite a lot about transfiguration and enlarging spells as sirius and rinna discussed and argued over how big the room needed to be the limitations of each spell and the supporting spells needed it impressed upon harry how complex magic could be and that enlarging a room was no simple matter of just reciting the right charm it was ron who offered what about opening up the french doors and having part of the party on the patio someone put up a warming charm on the back porch of the burrow christmas night and it was really comfortable out there you know sirius looked impressed excellent idea ron rinna smiled that where people can dance it wontbe too warm out there she tapped her finger to her lips musingly but i will need to spruce up the garden a bit if there will be guests out back everything is rather dead right now at that point remus lupin returned from the errands he d agreed to do it looks fantastic he admired as he glanced at the transfigured room his eyes flicked to rinna who d gone out the french doors it wontdo if she comes back in padfoot he said in a low voice right sirius tone was equally conspiratorial he glanced at the boys why dontyou lads get the glasses from the kitchen so we can see how many we need to conjure we ll be right back to help you he and lupin moved nonchalantly to remus room ron looked at harry i dontknow what that was all about but they were acting a lot like the twins do when they are up to something harry nodded in agreement come with me he said and led ron to his room they slipped into the pass through bathroom and sure enough the door to remus room was ajar the two men were leaning over the desk looking at something i cantbelieve you kept it all this time moony sirius said i told you to get rid of it remus straightened up and crossed his arms no you handed it to me and told me to get it out of your sight that you never wanted to see it again sirius grunted at the correction i kept it because i thought that if i ever was desperate for money i could at least sell it sirius looked at him curiously why didntyou sell it i mean i was conflicted remus sat on the bed and sighed rinna blamed herself for your defection and regretted breaking it off with you all that time she was at st mungo s even when she wasntresponding to anyone she would rub her fingers over her left hand over the spot where the ring used to be when she recovered i thought about giving it back to her but i wasntsure how she would take it we both thought you well you know what we both thought so i kept it and put it away and put it out of my mind remus shrugged until you mentioned it the other day i d quite forgotten i still had it sirius lifted a ring to his eye peering at it intently harry saw a glint of red and thought he knew what ring it was he elbowed ron do you think i should use it mate sirius asked remus why not it is the ring you intended for her to wear the rest of her life isntit his friend reasoned well women can be funny about these kinds of things harry chose that moment to pull the door open and step into the room ron at his side i say ron these two seem to be up to no good harry grinned at the expression on the two men faces i d solemnly swear it ron agreed with a reasonably straight face lupin recovered first padfoot old mate we seem to be losing our touch he said ruefully sirius snorted ah moony you may be right and a gleam lit his eyes but we also seem to have gained two co conspirators the first guest to arrive was nearly an hour early ron and harry were sitting in the enlarged living room playing exploding snap when a woman came stumbling out of the fireplace she was carrying a box and tripped on the hearth wobbled on her high heels and had nearly righted herself when the box started to slip from her grasp she grabbed for it and fell to the floor on her knees bloody buggering hell dorrie rinna voice rang happily from the kitchen are you all right luv she asked as she entered the living room she went over to help her friend up well i managed to save the liquor tonks quipped rinna laughed thank merlin you have your priorities straight she took out her wand and healed tonks knees then gave her friend a continental kiss she saw the two boys gawping rather speechless at the woman with the midnight blue sequined dress and the matching blue streak in her dark hair that was swept up into a complicated knot and secured with blue lacquered chopsticks dorrie this is my godson harry and his best mate ron tonks crossed to shake the boys hands harry ron rinna continued this is my best mate nymphadora tonks tonks winked it just tonks please nice to meet you both the boys stammered out appropriate greetings rinna pulled bottles out of the box would you lads take these over to the bar for me sure harry and ron abandoned their game to help and then you should probably start to get ready rinna appraised them and smirked dress robes are optional at their groans of relief she added nice trousers shirt jumper that should do i want you to be comfortable she turned back to her friend i on the other hand will have to find something comparable to this she indicated tonks outfit you are looking unusually conservative and sophisticated tonight dorrie tonks sniffed i ll have you know that i can clean up nicely if i choose to besides i wanted to make a good impression on your family rinna grabbed tonks arm and pulled her into the kitchen i just need to finish these canap s then i need to get ready by necessity only those who knew sirius secret could be guests to the party and nearly everyone was there percy had once again begged off when the doorbell rang i ll get it called harry who was closest to the door it was the grangers hello harry hermione greeted when he didntsay anything harry was a bit preoccupied to remember social niceties hermione looked great really great something stirred in his chest and he suddenly recalled what it had felt like when he d kissed her last summer she cleared her throat huh oh sorry harry stepped aside to let them in hello mr and mrs granger hello hermione please come in rinna herself had spoken to the grangers by telephone earlier that week and had explained everything to them harry had been impressed by rinna understanding of telephones but then he remembered she was familiar with the muggle world harry was glad because that meant he d see hermione during the holiday and now he was doubly glad and started scheming ways to make sure it was hermione he was standing next to at midnight so he had an excuse to kiss her rinna appeared and greeted the newcomers i so glad to finally meet you mr and mrs granger harry admired the picture his godmother made dressed in wine colored velvet and every inch the gracious hostess as she took each of hermione parents on an arm and escorted them into the room you must meet sirius and i dontbelieve you ve met all the weasleys have you hermione looked around wow it sure is a big house harry laughed and hooked her arm like rinna had done rinna and sirius enlarged it you would have liked watching them transfigure it it was very educational he teased she wrinkled her nose at him c mon let get something to eat harry pulled her into the room well this is rather entertaining wouldntyou say george asked sometime later he fred and ginny had joined the trio at the food table and the teens stuffed themselves silly on finger foods while they watched the adults get a bit squiffy someone had put on music and to the kids surprise molly and arthur were the first to start dancing on the patio actually they are quite good ginny commented i didntknow mum and dad could dance like that remus lupin had come to refill his plate and overheard it was quite the rage in your parents day to learn ballroom dancing even when i was in school he informed them he jutted his chin toward the dance floor look sirius and rinna had joined in they moved easily together wow harry breathed they re good too remus smiled those two stole the show at your parents wedding and sure enough their moves became more intricate and complex as the dance went on hermione parents followed not long after and soon tonks came and absconded with remus two waltzes a foxtrot and a meringue later the couples laughingly called a halt it was clear to their audience that dancing hadntalleviated the slight inebriation each one seemed to be experiencing mrs granger demurely sat down in the nearest chair molly was giggling and blushing as arthur leaned to whisper something in her ear remus was nursing a toe that tonks managed to not step on until after the dancing had stopped they both were laughing though and sirius was stealing a kiss from his partner who swayed a little when he released her i thirsty blackie rinna insisted we should break out the champagne now why wait for midnight sirius brushed his lips across the knuckles of her right hand as you wish m lady the champagne bottles were passed around several times harry kept glancing at his watch wondering if he was going to need to keep sirius on task hermione noticed it not quite ten o clock yet harry we re not going to miss the new year she teased harry leaned in to whisper to her maybe the excitement is going to start before midnight curiosity piqued she whispered back why what going on you ll see very soon harry promised sure enough a few minutes later sirius stood up stepped to the middle of the patio and tapped his champagne glass with his spoon lightly to draw notice ladies and gentlemen he began with a winning smile if i may have your attention rinna thought he looked very smart in his silk shirt and finely cut trousers and he stood like a man with full confidence in himself she could almost believe that azkaban had never happened to him she certainly realized once again why she had fallen so hard for him all those years ago not to mention now tonks noticed that rinna was watching her cousin with a rather wolfish look on her face she leaned over to her friend and noted he does look very scrummy tonight dunnie but you should wipe that drool off your chin before anyone notices very funny rinna hissed but her smile indicated she d been called out correctly all eyes in the room were now on sirius thank you all for being here tonight rinna and i are both pleased you could come i cantthink of a better way to ring in the new year than spending the evening in this fine company rinna leaned back and murmured to remus just how much has he had to drink remy because i think he is slipping into slughorn mode shut it and pay attention rinna remus admonished quietly this is important tonks snickered and rinna shot her a quizzical look remus and tonks both gestured to sirius pointedly so rinna returned her attention to her lover however there is some unfinished business that i feel i really must attend to before this year is over sirius walked over to where rinna was standing and took her hand pulling her forward a step or two tonks took the champagne flute from rinna other hand discretely what going on blackie rinna asked with a bemused smile he placed her hand on his heart and smiled in a way that made her knees almost buckle a faint warning pinged in her mind that he was up to something but damned if she hadntgone and gotten herself tipsy and found herself two or three steps behind him how very out of character for her well not the tipsy part but it was in her nature to try to maintain the upper hand then again he d always had a way of working his sirius black magic on her shut it and pay attention her heart echoed remus words this is important there was an intensity in his eyes like the sea after a storm that apprehended her attention rinna he said deep and low and she couldnthave looked away from him if she d tried rinna will you marry me rinna own sharp intake of breath followed by only milliseconds the collective gasp of the other attendees she looked at him convinced the champagne had somehow altered what he d actually said what marry me rinna he insisted softly his words had the effect of bringing sudden and much needed clarity to her head when sirius was taken aback what when will we get married sirius he faltered uh i dunno when my name is cleared and no another communal gasp filled the air this time colored with shock but just like that day last summer on the weasleys back lawn rinna and sirius didnteven seem to notice sirius was stunned but i not doing that again she said quietly doing what rinna i dontunderstand she smiled sadly there was never a date it was always after i was done with school after you were done with training after i finished some assignment after lily and james wedding after the dark lord was defeated her voice quavered and she stopped to take a breath we waited for the perfect time sirius she reached up to his face with a gentle caress and yet here we are still so donttell me some vague time in the future that may never happen if we re to be married tell me when he took the hand she held to his cheek and tenderly dropped a kiss in her palm all right he said the saturday after harry birthday he watched her mouth drop in surprise that should give us enough time to figure out how to pull this off dontyou think rinna huffed out a little laugh of astonishment ah all right she smiled up at him sirius cocked an eyebrow at her is that a yes oh sweet merlin yes she threw her arms around his neck and laughed merrily as he twirled her around with a shout of triumph the fact that they had an audience was suddenly apparent by the thunder of applause and cheers a shrill whistle pierced the air the happy couple heads whipped around to eye remus who held up a small box and shook it for emphasis padfoot old friend i think you need this sirius neatly caught the box remus tossed his way a wave of nervousness inexplicably washed over him as he turned back to rinna and opened the box what if she doesntwant it back for the moment attention was off the couple as everyone else present chattered excitedly sirius was relieved maybe doing this in front of everyone hadntbeen the best idea after all rinna gasped as he opened the box her hand snaked in to snatch the ring from the velvet and she peered at it flummoxed is this you kept it how sirius pried it from her fingers and then slipped it on her left hand you dontmind i could get you a different one he watched as a number of emotions played across her face she hesitated do we need a new start are we picking up where we left off does this ring bring back more bad memories than good she wasntsure rinna his voice was nervous irresolute no no dontget a new one she gave him a soft wistful smile i loved this ring sirius slid both his hands along her jaw to pull her into a loving kiss she wrapped her arms around his neck and returned it unreservedly their guests became aware that the happy couple was sealing their engagement with a snog and the cheering began again although this time it was accompanied by a few catcalls at the next break in the dancing tonks grabbed rinna and pulled her into the house she lifted rinna hand and demanded i want to see it she admired the oval ruby highlighted with diamonds it bloody gorgeous dunnie it is rinna agreed something in her friend voice made tonks glance at her sharply she grabbed rinna again come on and pulled her to her bedroom what wrong tonks asked softly rinna hesitated i probably just being silly tonks pressed what do you think it s bad luck to wear the ring like tempting fate tonks looked at her incredulously i never took you to be superstitious rinna well i not usually a rueful look crossed her face it just that i cantshake this feeling she shuddered as if she was chilled all that time i wore it we never married it was like the relationship was doomed back then you re right tonks interrupted you are being silly for merlin sake you have a date set you have a ring on your finger and all evidence points to you getting married in seven months now tell me where is the gloom and doom in that but rinna could not throw off the melancholy that had seized her but you know my history all my family dead my best friend who was closer than a sister dead sirius taken to azkaban she sat on the edge of the bed her face in her hands my blood has an ancient taint of darkness dorrie what if i not meant to have any happy relationships tonks put her hands on her hips in order to refrain from slapping her friend well if that were true she said with asperity then remus and i should be dead shouldntwe rinna head snapped up and she looked at her friend in astonishment oh she breathed see you re just being silly tonks smirked cheekily besides sirius blood is as dark as they come so the way i see it you two are well suited to each other rinna looked at her in shock for several long seconds before blinking and huffing out a laugh tonks hooked her arm in rinna and pulled her up from the bed put it out of your mind luv you re just having bridal jitters the two women walked back to the living room before tonks leaned in and added wickedly you know it a tad early to be getting cold feet i am not getting cold feet was rinna indignant reply she carefully pushed her strange mood and misgivings to the back of her mind i think the champagne level in my system has dropped too low as my maid of honor dorrie dear it is your job to take care of the bride tonks hugged her tight i d be honored to be your maid of honor and to get you more bubbly harry found hermione in the shadows just outside the ring of candlelight that lit the magically warmed patio she was watching the dancers and harry thought the look on her face seemed a little wistful he leaned against the wall next to her and smiled as he glanced around charlie had taken his sister to the dance floor and the two of them were laughing and having a good time harry could hear fred ron and george just inside they were playing a rather heated and involved card game called held and the good natured insults were occasionally audible above the music playing outside how has your holiday been hermione asked him smashing he grinned you fine but i have to admit this has been the most eventful part of it she snorted my parents are certainly having a good time her smile indicated she was glad about that she returned to watching the dancing harry took a deep breath he couldntbelieve he was going to ask this but she looked like she wanted to do you want to dance hermione he said in a breathless rush she looked startled as she turned her gaze on him but then her expression lightened harry that is really sweet but i not going to force you to relive any horrifying yule ball memories she teased harry couldntdecide if he was disappointed or relieved they stood in companionable silence in the shadows for a while harry discovered that his hand had somehow found its way to hermione s and his fingers were curling around hers listen hermione about the yule ball oh harry dontfeel like you have to apologize for ronald behavior no that not what i wanted to say harry squeezed hermione hand i i wanted to say he ran his other hand through his unruly hair unknowingly mimicking his father that is uh look i sorry i didntask you to the yule ball his rueful expression conveyed his regret hermione was surprised you are well yeah i mean you um you looked amazing that night and i probably would have had a much better time with you than i did and you wouldnthave had to go with someone you dontknow he looked at her hopefully that is what the whole viktor krum thing was about right getting back at me and ron for being total idiots for overlooking you something sparked in hermione eyes the whole viktor krum thing was about a nice guy asking me to a dance a nice guy wanting to enjoy my company and treating me like i was important to him you are important to me mione you know that harry protested you stuck by me when ron you helped me with the summoning charm i wouldnthave made it through the first task if it wasntfor his words tumbled over one another in his desperation to reassure her and to try to rectify his stupid error hermione eyes softened harry i your friend no matter what she put her hand on his shoulder harry felt hope spread through him so you forgive me i mean you forgive us ron and me he opened his eyes wide in sincerity we didntmean to hurt your feelings oh stop with the puppy dog eyes yes i forgive you as if i could stay angry with you when you look at me like that prat harry grinned good then i guess that means you wontneed to hang around krum anymore harry noted happily hermione frowned hang on i never said i wouldnthang around viktor i already told you i wasntusing him to make you jealous the hopeful elation harry was feeling suddenly came crashing down at his feet but you you dontreally like krum do you he asked dreading the answer hermione took a long time to answer do you mean do i like him or do i fancyhim uh because i do like him and i think that i am starting to fancy him she sounded a bit surprised as if she had just now worked it all out for herself harry shook his head in denial no no hermione you can t you cantfancy him why not her voice was shrill with indignation because harry replied hotly because he faltered ah hell harry grabbed her by the back of the head and pulled her mouth against his for a split second hermione was so startled she didntmove then in the next second she pushed against his chest harry brought one hand up to cup her face and the other arm he wrapped around her waist to pull her closer hermione forgot why she was struggling and opened her mouth to sigh into his greatly encouraged he changed his angle and pressed his lips back to hers hermione hands slid from his chest to his shoulders as she kissed him back but when her hands moved to his hips harry groaned hermione head jerked back and she stared at him with huge shocked eyes harry what the hell hermione she placed her hands on his chest and shoved him back dont do that but he couldnttell if she was angry or going to cry just don t her eyes searched his face it ll only mess everything up harry she saw him open his mouth to protest just dont okay her face scrunched up she turned and fled harry leaned back against the wall and knocked his head back in frustration he let out a big sigh are you all right the voice was low with concern harry opened his eyes to see his godfather looking sympathetic no sirius nodded and leaned up against the wall next to harry i wasnttrying to eavesdrop i just happened by and heard i sorry harry laughed bitterly what do you have to be sorry for you just got the woman of your dreams to agree to marry you sirius jerked his head in the direction hermione had gone i thought she was just a best friend well yeah but tell me harry sirius interrupted when you close your eyes is it her face you see in your mind harry closed his eyes no he shook his head sirius shrugged then she not the woman of your dreams he explained simply harry let out a big breath i guess he stared glumly at his shoes but she the only girl i ve ever kissed sirius clapped his hand on harry shoulder reassuringly that my friend will not be the state of things forever now come on back to the party the new year is almost here the party had broken up by around one in the morning he tried to do his part but harry had yawned so much during cleanup that rinna had laughingly banished him to bed however tired as he was he couldntseem to fall asleep the gaffe with hermione kept playing over and over in his head harry tossed around in his bed and realized he was thirsty a cool glass of milk sounded very appealing so he got up to quietly pad to the kitchen the clock in his room told him it was almost two o clock he did not expect anyone to be up at this hour but as he came into sight of the living room he realized that rinna was standing at the fireplace which provided the only light in the room idly levitating to the kitchen used half empty glasses that had been set on the mantel harry froze not wanting to startle her the glasses disappeared and she stood in front of the flames lost in thought with the fingers of her right hand tracing around the ring on her left out of the corner of his eye harry saw the light in the kitchen go out and he turned to see sirius enter the living room and cross to the fireplace sirius came up behind rinna and slipped his arms around her pulling her back against his chest he bent forward and kissed her on the side of her neck her head lolled sideways as she gave a sigh of contentment he continued to kiss and nuzzle her for a minute before he lifted his mouth to her ear and said in a deep voice i solemnly swear that i am up to no good rinna gave a throaty chuckle and replied i cantsay that surprises me marauder boy in a very sexy voice she turned in his arms and their lips met in a kiss a kiss that quickly turned very passionate harry knew he should turn away knew that this was a private moment but his body would not obey and his eyes remained riveted on the scene that was rapidly becoming very educational sirius ran his hands up the bodice of her velvet dress stopping at the curves of her breasts as he started a trail of kisses along her jaw and down her neck to where the velvet revealed her d collet rinna gasped and her hands flew to his collar where she began to unbutton his shirt her hands sensuously caressed their way from his abdomen up his chest and across his nipples eliciting a groan from him his hand grasped her bum and he pulled her pelvis against his as he crashed his mouth to hers again their hips gyrated slowly in a primal dance as sirius hand slid under her bum to the back of her thigh lifting her leg up while he pulled her even closer to him with his other arm harry felt his mouth go dry as he desperately tried to form a coherent thought what would he do if they started to get back in your room you perv part of his brain told him unfortunately that part was quickly overrun by teenaged hormones and harry feet remained resolutely where they were at least the couch wasntfacing him he wouldntbe able to see them if they started to he couldnttell if he was relieved or disappointed at that thought he was snapped out of his disturbing contemplation by the wet sound of lips being pulled apart rinna and sirius were standing wrapped around each other foreheads touching desperately trying to catch their breath sirius cupped her face in his hand and looked into her eyes a salacious grin spreading across his face do you realize ruby red that i haventmade love to you since last year a sultry smile lit up her face mmmm you re right this is a completely unacceptable situation blackie her green eyes sparked with mischief and something far more basic well i going to remedy the situation right he swung her up into his arms now he turned to walk toward the hall as she muffled a surprised squeal into his shoulder harry feet were moving before his brain even registered that they were coming toward him he slipped back into his room and leaned against his door heart pounding in reaction to almost getting caught spying at least that the only reason he could think of that his heart was thudding so hard he heard them pass and then heard the door to her bedroom shut and let out his breath in a long shaky sigh he moved to the bathroom and drank two glasses of cool water before looking at his dusky reflection in the mirror he couldntsee it in the dim light but he knew his face was flushed and he was breathing hard five months ago it seemed impossible that his godparents would ever get together again now they were going to get married and as he d just observed they were once again lovers he stretched himself out on his bed his body still buzzing in reaction to the scene he d just witnessed he felt a little guilty a little bit pervy but mostly he felt strange a good kind of strange he tried not to think about what was going on in the bedroom not far from him but it was a long while before he fell asleep sirius propped up on his elbow to feast on the sight of his gorgeous ruby in the candlelight covered in a thin sheen of sweat breathing rapidly eyes closed he brushed some of her hair off her damp forehead and she opened her eyes her beautiful lips stretched into a satisfied smile as she reached up to caress his cheek he ducked his head and kissed her deeply before pulling away to whisper mischief managed i ll say her voice was a mixture of lust and admiration he chuckled and pulled her to him spooning against her back and wrapping his arm around her waist possessively happy new year sirius she murmured he pressed his lips to the back of her neck and inhaled her scent it is certainly starting off that way he felt her sigh contentedly against him and he closed his eyes and let his satiated body drift to sleep a n the phrases as you wish and eyes like the sea after a storm are from my favorite movie the princess bride rinna sings the coventry carol which is an old english carol the name of the bass player for the weird sisters is courtesy of the harry potter lexicon the inspiration for tonks attire came from fan art by shalou entitled blue kiss and tonks in blue that can be found on her website greensuitsyou i added the chopsticks held is a crazy card game i play with my cronies every new years eve i dontknow if that is the true name but that is what they told me it was called last year i

belong to me i would be remiss if i did not give special props to my beta lorett many times we worked out plot kinks over the phone while she was in the drive thru of the local el pollo loco mmmm music filled the air as harry filed into his new defense against the dark arts classroom with hermione and ron and the rest of his fellow fourth year gryffindors and hufflepuffs it was an upbeat song currently very popular with the teenaged wizarding population already some of the students had begun to move in time with the music bobbing their heads or moving their torsos to the beat and a few had actually broken into some dance moves by the time harry and his friends had reached their seats where is rinna harry wondered he slipped into place standing between the desk and chair and was about to whisper his question to his companions when ron grabbed his and hermione arms dontsit down ron hissed softly something not right almost in unison the three of them pulled out their wands harry looked warily around the classroom and saw that some of the students had already taken their seats looks of alarm began to sprout on their faces they could no longer move harry tried to step away from the desk and found he could not but he still had use of his arms hermione and ron who had not yet set foot behind their desks were still mobile they had both assumed defensive postures harry racked his brains for a spell that would free his legs from whatever had him bound cries of alarm or frustration now sounded throughout the room but before panic could set in a voice authoritatively cut across the music and babble enough professor dunlevy appeared at the front and surveyed the now silent room do not tell me that you spent all of last term in mad eye moody class and this is all you have to show for it her voice wasntunkind but it was clear she was disappointed what happened to constant vigilance hmm she crossed her arms and drummed the fingers of one hand on her sleeve no one answered because really there was nothing to say they had been caught unawares ah well i suppose we have the rest of the year to work on this dontwe rinna uncrossed her arms and made her way through the class those of you already sitting should be able to move now there were soft exclamations of relief from most of the class rinna stopped by neville who had only one foot behind his desk and was standing with his wand drawn please tell me mr longbottom how you managed to not be completely ensnared in my little trap neville gulped w well i felt the spell take h hold of my foot he grew bolder when he saw his professor nodding obviously pleased so i stopped and drew my wand only i couldntthink of any spell to counter it professor he ended dejectedly that was not the point neville she noted kindly two points to you for avoiding becoming completely incapacitated and three more for drawing your wand her eyes swept the room the same for everyone else who is standing behind his or her desk her lips moved slightly as she tallied points for each house now for those of you still standing free congratulations on not being hoodwinked she smiled however mr macmillan and mr thomas the only reason you circumvented my ruse was because you were tardy so no points for you take your seats the boys stammered out an apology professor dunlevy turned to hannah abbott miss abbott why didntyou sit down hannah pointed to ron and hermione because i saw ron grab harry and hermione by the arms he looked concerned so i guessed that something was wrong very good five points to you miss abbott rinna walked over to hermione and ron miss granger ron told me something wasntright and not to sit professor at rinna raised eyebrow she added a bit defensively well it would have been foolish of me to ignore him without seeing for myself if he was right the professor smiled again precisely five points and three more for drawing your wand she turned to ron and why did you say that mr weasley ron shrugged dunno he said it just felt wrong interest sparked in her eyes could you elaborate on that please he licked his upper lip well i got this weird feeling like something was trickling up my spine it got stronger the closer we got to the desks harry thought the look that crossed his godmother face was a combination of excitement smugness and satisfaction excellent she declared you would do well ron to never ignore that feeling one side of ron mouth turned up ruefully how do you think i ve managed to survive living with the twins all this time rinna joined the class in laughter you have a good point in fact why dontyou take ten points for being the only one to detect my little spell before it took hold of you oh and three for the wand ron sat down flushing with pleasure rinna advanced on the one standing student remaining seamus finnigan quickly stated i felt something weird too professor dunlevy really she cocked her head perhaps that was you throwing out your back with all the dancing you were doing her eyes snapped with mirth the class erupted in laughter and catcalls seamus grinned and took a bow he winked impudently at his teacher well you have to admit those killer dance moves did save me bum didntthey she nodded and yet in spite of that mr finnigan neither killer dance moves nor cheekiness are considered legitimate defenses against the dark arts she allowed her grin to finally take over her face you may take your seat she returned to the front of the class i suppose you have all figured out by now what we will be studying first harry smiled to himself as he watched rinna in her professor persona explain her expectations of the students in this course he had a feeling d a d a was going to be his favorite class this term herbology had been all right that is as long as one didntcount the time spent slogging through the snow to get to the greenhouses but care of magical creatures had not started auspiciously as hagrid was nowhere to be found and a substitute professor took the class instead professor grubbly plank had completely refused to give harry and his friends any information about hagrid and his unexplained absence things went worse when malfoy took great pleasure in showing harry and the other gryffindors rita skeeter latest article the multi page story from the daily prophet was an expose on hagrid giant heritage but it also took pot shots at dumbledore moody and finally harry himself harry had been furious at the slytherins who had provided several less than accurate quotes that skeeter had used to great effect and his mood was not helped at all by the gryffindor girls including hermione who d commented on the excellence of the class on unicorns they had just experienced but if his rotten mood had been a cake the icing that would have topped it was seeing cedric diggory walking into the great hall for dinner holding the hand of cho chang and escorting her to her seat at the ravenclaw table hermione eyed harry warily as he viciously cut into his dinner none of the trio said much as they ate but once they got up from the table to go back out to hagrid cabin hermione murmured to her two companions er i was going to um meet someone at the library after dinner i thought you said you wanted hagrid to come back but now you arentgoing with us to talk to him harry cut in angrily i already told you i want hagrid back hermione insisted what i was about to say is i was going to meet someone but now i will have to find him and tell him it off i ll catch up with you in a sec all right without waiting for a response hermione turned and walked away did she say him ron asked harry i afraid so harry replied grimly as he watched hermione catch the eye of viktor krum who soon followed her out to the entrance hall ron saw the same thing and swore c mon let go outside and wait for her there i dontwant to see this harry scrutinized his friend from the corner of his eye yeah they left the castle and started to make their way down the frozen path to hagrid s except for d a d a this was a horrible first day dontyou think ron grunted an affirmative makes me wish i was back home with rinna and sirius ron gratefully seized the change of subject yeah you had a good holiday did i tell you about what happened after the new year eve party harry took advantage of the fact that hermione had not yet caught them and told ron what he d seen in rinna living room early on new year day you saw them doing what ron squeaked his voice high in consternation he and harry had stopped near the rocks by the path that led down to hagrid hut and pulled their cloaks tightly around them harry had illuminated his wand so hermione could find them i saw them making out they were in the living room and i had stepped out to get something from the kitchen harry was interrupted by his friend making retching noises what doesntthat creep you out why would it harry asked genuinely puzzled ron stared at him as if he d grown an extra head harry they re your godparents you witnessed them getting off for merlin sake blimey if i ever caught my parents doing something like that he shuddered ugh nasty he stuck out his tongue and shuddered again for effect harry smiled at his mate melodramatic antics well ron i did spend most of the last term hoping they d get back together i just thought that it was an encouraging sign that things were going well besides it not like i caught them doing well it or anything ron threw his hands up in front of his face and winced stop stop dontsay that donteven give my mind the chance to form that mental image of my parents aaaaugh ron dropped his head into his hands great bleeding hell harry he said weakly i going to have to get hit in the head by a bludger now face it mate harry snickered a fiendish smirk on his face your parents have done it at least seven times six times they had twins ron was turning an amazing shade of red and sounded like he might be hyperventilating they only did it six times he insisted at that moment hermione happened to finally join them did what six times she asked pertly as she set her book bag down on the rocks nothing gasped ron at the same time that harry said had sex in a matter of fact tone hermione turned bright red what in merlin name are you talking about she blurted harry who was truly getting some perverse enjoyment from his friend discomfiture explained we re talking about how many times ron parents have no no mione make him stop ron moaned piteously hermione took in the looks on her two friends faces put her hands on her hips and admonished harry potter you can be pure evil sometimes she shouldered her bag and snapped i out of here i right there with you ron muttered as he scrambled after her harry followed his two friends at a slower pace chuckling he refused to feel guilty for rattling them both after all he had had a terrible day and with the anxiety of the second task starting to loom over him he needed to get as many laughs as he could although he mused as he watched his two friends silhouetted in their wand light a little way down the path he had other things to worry about as well like why the staccato rhythm his heart made each time he watched cho chang walk gracefully through the halls at hogwarts was the exact same rhythm he had just felt when he looked at hermione blushing face in the light of his wand a hogsmeade weekend was coming up mid way through january hermione mentioned this to viktor one evening in the library and proceeded to tell him about the only all wizarding village in the entirety of britain and when it is all snowy like it is right now it looks like something out of a storybook viktor was content to sit and let her voice kept low because they were in the library wash over him he was quite sure that hermione could describe the dirtiest neighborhood in the ugliest part of sofia bulgaria capital city and make it seem beautiful he smiled it sounds loffly tell me vich are the places you most like to go there his ruse to keep her talking was working but the hogwarts librarian who reminded him of a prune was giving them nasty looks he touched her arm the sour lady is how you say glaring at us he interrupted i do not vant you to get in trouble hermione glanced around before taking his hand and whispering come with me she led him toward the back where there was an alcove near the section on magical forensics not many students visited these stacks we still need to be quiet but we wontdraw her attention here viktor looked around and wondered how hermione knew of such a spot which practically begged for a couple of students to steal secret kisses there he wished he knew if she d ever shown this place to potter how did you find this place he asked casually please i ve been coming to this library for four years now she noted with asperity this is a good spot to get away from other students when they are whispering at the tables she chuckled just like we were he laughed softly it is also good place for a boy and a girl to talk in romantic vay he suggested hermione blushed oh i didn t i wasn t her reaction told viktor all he needed to know it vas just an observation herm own ninny i like this place ve can talk here vithout the library lady breathing on our necks yes he sat on the low cushioned bench and patted the seat next to him come and finish telling me about hogsmeade she sat and turned to him viktor it silly for me to keep prattling on about hogsmeade when you could just come on the outing and see it yourself vat do you mean come to hogsmeade next weekend i could show you around if you like she bit her lip when she realized how forward she sounded oh now he understood why she had brought it up in the first place she wanted to go on the outing with him i do not think that vould be good idea he said regretfully as soon as the words were out of his mouth he knew they had not come out the way he meant he shook his head in frustration his grasp of english always seemed more tenuous when he was around her hermione frowned trying to mask her disappointment why dontyou want to go to hogsmeade she stopped herself from adding with me viktor could hear the hurt that laced her words he reached out and took her hand herm own ninny it is not that i vish i could go especially vith you but i regret much if i go there vill be crowds of people reporters fans you see oh hermione did see i didntthink of that i guess i forgot that you well you draw a crowd i sorry viktor felt a strange sensation twinge in his chest no mila do not be sorry he glanced around they were still alone in the nook in the library he tugged her hand and pulled her closer to him eyes fixed on her warm brown gaze that you think of me only as viktor and not viktor krum bulgarian seeker makes me very happy his words were soft and low and beguilingly accented they seemed to weave a spell over her heart to make it beat faster she felt his hand very gently tilt her chin up and his smile with that damnable dimple filled her vision as he leaned forward and pressed his lips to hers hermione closed her eyes and slipped her hands up his arms and she was swept away in a current of pleasurable sensations as viktor kissed her and kissed her and kissed her again she traced her fingers up his neck and into his dark hair at the base of his skull and kissed him back enthusiastically here was a new kind of magic one she had yet to study the kind of magic that this bulgarian wizard had used to change her into one of those girls who swooned at slavic inflections and a nice set of shoulders her mouth curved into a smile under the sweet and purposeful pressure of his lips she had always enjoyed investigating new topics now hadntshe late in january the halls of the castle were chilly and darkening as the evening gave way to nighttime and harry stalked out of the library annoyed and frustrated he hadntspent that much time in there since before the first task when ron and he hadntbeen speaking and he d spent all his time hanging out with hermione except that this time he d been on his own ever since he and ron and hermione had helped dumbledore convince hagrid to return to teaching harry had felt terribly guilty about letting hagrid believe he d already worked out the clue for the next task in the golden egg cedric diggory suggestion given at the end of the yule ball was whispering in the back of harry mind but harry attitude toward diggory was still very sour no doubt a result of seeing the hufflepuff champion holding hands with cho chang practically on a daily basis diggory had hinted that harry should take a bath with the golden egg and harry wasntentirely convinced that it wasntmeant as a joke so rather than be made a fool harry had decided to do some research in the library he d counted on having hermione help him after all she had an uncanny knack of finding obscure references at seemingly precisely the time they were needed rather handy skill that but the moment he saw her sitting at a table with viktor krum quietly discussing who knew what he knew he couldntask for her assistance for one thing he d told her he d already figured the egg out so she wouldntnag him about going on the hogsmeade outing instead of working on the clue and for another well there was the krum factor no way in hell was harry going to let on that he was having trouble with the egg near the durmstrang champion after all wasnthe in this untenable position to begin with because he was trying to avoid looking like a complete dolt he should have known it was a hopeless quest without his brainy friend he d scoured the stacks for anything he thought might help to no avail he had all but made up his mind to swallow his pride and ask hermione for help when he looked toward her table in time to see krum take her hand hermione blushed but gave the bulgarian a knowing smile before leading him deeper into the library and out of sight harry sat down flummoxed all thoughts of the golden egg flew from his mind as he was confronted head on by a maelstrom of emotions he couldnteven begin to identify where does she think she is going with him he thought indignantly in the past hermione had always been able to sense when he or ron were struggling with their homework and needed help how can she leave when i need her he dropped his head in his hands in frustration a part of his mind was telling him he was being selfish and childish but he told that little voice to bugger off while he tried to figure out why his gut twisted so much he felt queasy harry remembered the night they returned from christmas holiday when the students had filed into the great hall for dinner a tall brooding figure had made a beeline to intercept hermione she had flushed and smiled as krum approached her he then pulled her aside and spoke to her quietly harry had felt his teeth clench not even here five minutes and they re at it ron low voice had been bitter all harry could do was grunt some kind of acknowledgement ron had been too wrapped up in his disapproval to notice harry reaction to the reunion for which harry had been grateful he d half a mind to follow the two of them into the stacks but what would he say i was your friend first merlin how old was he anyway five harry knew he had to get out of there before he made a complete ass of himself he might as well give up on the egg there was no way he could concentrate on solving that clue now so he stalked out of the library sullenly it was dark nearing time for curfew and the halls were practically empty harry abominable mood made him oblivious to anything so he was very startled by someone coming up the dungeon stairs just as he was passing them it was his godmother she had been lost in thought as well and was as startled as he was harry you nearly gave me a coronary sorry he said automatically then he looked suspiciously down the dungeon stairwell what were you doing down there she gave him an inscrutable look just investigating she answered smoothly investigating what investigating which students have a propensity for skulking about and trying to scare the staff half to death she teased what are you up to she wondered why his sidekicks were nowhere in sight me harry laughed cynically just leaving the library after my evening turned into a total waste of time his tone made rinna appraise him carefully my classroom isnttoo far she noted casually i could conjure some tea or hot cocoa and maybe we could salvage the evening a bit before curfew it was harry turn to study her concern dusted her face and she was in full godmother mode he heaved a big sigh and said flatly i doubt it she deliberately misinterpreted him actually i quite capable of conjuring tea i ll have you know a smile appeared fleetingly on his face yeah i know i ve seen you do it rinna cocked her head in invitation come on neither spoke as they went up the stairs to the d a d a classroom she ushered him into her small office at the back of the room and soon a steaming kettle and mismatched cups and saucers were on her desk would you like peppermint or chamomile or perhaps something stronger she peered at him do you need to be able to stay up tonight you look like you should try to get some sleep she fussed before breaking off sorry i think i was taken over by molly weasley for a minute there harry grinned weakly s okay you re not too bad at the mum thing you know oh thank you so much she said sarcastically as she dropped a mock curtsey but her heart gave an extra ka thunk at the oblique compliment and i feel like peppermint so that what you re having too impudent scamp harry shrugged his acquiescence he felt her eyes on him as he blew across the rim of his teacup to cool the contents so what were you looking for in the library she prompted harry sighed that anxious feeling he felt before the first task was back in his stomach it was time to put it all out on the table so to speak i was trying to figure out the clue from the golden egg he said miserably i see to her credit rinna managed to not look terribly taken aback she leaned back in her chair and sipped her tea as she digested this information i sure you realize that the second task is only a few weeks away harry finished for her yeah i know he hung his head it just that well there was the yule ball and christmas and then hagrid and that beastly article harry she placed a hand on his arm harry look at me he raised his eyes to hers and found her face full of concern and empathy you still have time but none to lose so let look at this logically do you have any idea about how to decipher the clue any at all no he paused well rinna gave him a go on gesture cedric diggory said something to me right after the yule ball rinna raised an eyebrow what did he say he told me to take a bath with my egg gave me the password to the prefect bath but i thought he might be pulling my leg so i haven t she held up a hand why would cedric give you a hint in the first place and why wouldntyou believe him if he did harry proceeded to tell her how he had warned cedric about the dragons but i told him outright and he just told me a riddle so i thought that maybe he was trying to make me look like a fool in front of cho harry trailed off once he said it out loud he realized it sounded very petty that doesntseem in character with the cedric diggory i know rinna said quietly but that is neither here nor there have you heard anything from the other two champions harry shook his head have you seen anything practicing spells taking books from a particular section of the library no i hardly see fleur at all and krum i saw him in the library but he was just sitting with hermione talking and holding her hand the note in his voice prompted rinna to take notice but she did not comment instead she asked that it the only time you ve seen him harry brows pulled together hang on i saw him the day we went to hogsmeade hermione ron and i watched him jump off the durmstrang ship to go swimming in the lake i thought he was completely mad swimming in that water when it is so cold huh harry stared at her bemusedly what do you mean huh what that got to do with the clue rinna leaned forward her voice low and intense think about it harry let assume for the moment that diggory is on the level he tells you to take a bath krum went swimming in the lake she paused meaningfully do you see any connection any commonality he scrunched his face in concentration as several long moments ticked by he snapped his fingers water he looked up at his godmother it has something to do with water he lifted the corner of his mouth ruefully i guess i ll be taking that bath after all the prefect bath is really very nice she noted mildly i highly recommended it only be sure to take your father invisibility cloak if you are going to wander around late at night breaking curfew she smirked i really shouldnthave said that harry grinned said what he asked innocently good lad silence filled the room like an old worn afghan warm and comfortable yet rinna was having an internal debate should she let the evening end on this pleasant note or should she open up a potentially huge can of worms she sighed inwardly well she d never been one to be squeamish about creepy crawlies i surprised you didntask hermione to help you tonight her voice was she hoped drenched in nonchalance harry glanced sharply at rinna the expression on her face was open and inviting and he remembered a conversation from several months back you know that you can stop by and talk brooms with me anytime right just brooms he asked brooms quidditch girls whatever i d say any topic is fair game he thought he knew what she was doing he just wasntsure if he really wanted to talk about girls specifically his wild haired first kiss friend he squirmed he knew that if rinna chose to she could probably find out everything she wanted to know through skillful and subtle interrogation and he wouldnteven realize what she was doing he d seen her extract confessions of shirked homework from several of his classmates in just such a manner the poor sods hadntknown what hit them until it was all said and done if he had learned anything from d a d a this month it was to never underestimate his godmother but at this moment she was being very transparent with him and he rather felt that if he shut down the conversation she would not pursue it he decided to test his theory well she was studying with krum tonight he gave a little shrug ah her expression remained pleasantly neutral she sipped her tea harry felt compelled to add lest she think krum intimidated him and i didntwant him to know i hadntfigured out the clue yet she nodded of course she held up the teapot to offer him more he pushed his cup to her for a refill then she warmed her own cup inhaled the aroma and took another sip harry waited she really wasntgoing to press him for information he felt his heart swell with affection for her and he smiled to himself she wasntlike molly weasley at all not that molly weasley is bad he amended to himself after all sometimes it nice to have someone mother you and make you talk your problems out for your own good rinna watched the battle play out over harry features she hoped she had earned his trust but she wasntgoing to press the issue it was hard enough to get boys to talk about their feelings without an adult authority figure breathing down their necks and demanding it she was pretty sure that their late night tea time was about to end at least they had gotten the subject of the second task out in the open that was the most important matter at hand of course she reminded herself at harry age matters of the heart were equally important right up there with life and death situations like surviving triwizard tournament tasks she smiled a bit as she remembered wanting to sink through the floor or drop dead on the spot because of some embarrassing at the moment situation with a boy she was startled out of her reverie by harry own attempt at nonchalance did sirius tell you about new year eve she knew exactly what he was referring to harry unfortunate kissing of hermione he did she replied gently and waited for him to go on harry waited for her to say more finally harry snorted when he realized what was going on he wanted her to ask she didntwant to push him it was an impasse rinna he said almost reproachfully i think this is the part where you are supposed to ask me if i want to talk about it one side of his mouth twitched up into a wry half grin his godmother eyebrows rose right sorry i am new to this whole mum thing you know haventhad much practice yet and it not like expertise in the dark arts or potions is any help harry grinned and leaned back in his chair she was flustered and out of her element and he felt like the ground had evened out well this is your lucky night then darling godmother i happen to be here for you to practice on there was a subtle shift in the atmosphere at that moment when her gaze locked with his and he watched her lips twitch at the corners he could not put his finger on how he knew it but somehow the two of them had turned a corner in their relationship so harry she asked gently eyes never leaving his do you want to talk about it not really he told her honestly but i confused about how i feel about my best friend and i cantsort it out and i figured well you used to be a girl maybe you could help me he looked as wretched as any fourteen year old with a crush on somebody could and rinna had to resist the urge to pull him into her arms and comfort him or do something equally as insulting to his tender male ego i promise i ll do my best she reassured him i ll just brew us something a little stronger shall i hermione looked up to see harry coming through the portrait hole well past curfew ron had already left the common room for the night as had most of the other inhabitants of gryffindor tower harry looked to their usual spot spotted her and strode toward her she opened her mouth to scold him for being out past curfew without his invisibility cloak i know what you re going to say mione but rinna walked me to the tower herself so i wouldntget into trouble he sat down next to her oh i was wondering where you were she returned to the essay she d been writing on switching spells harry stared into the fire and with the conversation with rinna fresh in his mind worked up the courage to speak so i ve been thinking about what you said she looked up puzzled what i said when on new years when i kissed you hermione flushed oh you said i was going to ruin everything she put down her quill harry he held up a hand please hermione let me say this he watched her close her mouth as she looked at him with wide eyes i dontknow exactly what you were talking about that night but i do know one thing that i absolutely do not want to ruin and that is our friendship harry her voice broke he continued as if she hadntinterrupted i dontknow what it is i feel about you but i know that it is messing me up because i terrified that i think of you as you know more than a friend but i also terrified that i may lose you harry she whispered and it not worth it hermione it not not if i ruin our friendship he looked at her unhappily it terrible timing isntit me realizing that it is you i want to be snogging just when you want to be snogging someone else harry she waited to see if he would interrupt her again you re my best friend that was my first kiss last summer mine too and honestly i cantthink of anyone better to share that with it felt safe with you you know she took his hand hermione always knew how to hit the nail on the head yeah i do know i knew you d be honest with me without hurting my feelings too badly he told her hurting your feelings she looked perplexed you know telling me if the kiss was ghastly or if i rubbish with girls you re not rubbish with girls harry hermione exclaimed indignantly then she added shyly and none of the kisses were ghastly harry mouthed the word kisses in comprehension noting the plural and grinned really hermione rolled her eyes boys she slapped him lightly on the shoulder his grin slowly softened he looked at her hand in his so you really do fancy krum she blushed and nodded he inhaled through his nose then let the breath out listen mione be careful he a lot older than you he saw her eyes start to snap now dontget mad hear me out i ve heard the way oliver and the other seventh year boys talk he blushed and so did she he squeezed her hand just be careful okay she answered softly he turned and took her face in his hands if he hurts you i dontcare how much bigger he is than me i ll i ll hex him into next week hermione threw her arms around harry and hugged him tightly that about the nicest thing anyone ever said to me well he said gruffly into her mass of hair we ll always watch each others backs wontwe the first day of february which was clear and cold with a dusting of fresh snow found each of the underclassmen d a d a classes out on the grounds having been warned to dress warmly in the dinnertime announcements the night before where professor dunlevy had fashioned fortresses bunkers and foxholes in the snow she proceeded to explain the rules of the exercise it like capture the flag hermione whispered several others nodded recognizing the similarities to the muggle game the object was to seize the other team house flag the professor set several safety charms including a sunblocking charm to avoid sunburn before answering any final questions oh and class she added with a very wicked tilt to the grin she gave them all i forgot to mention a summoning charm caught everyone by surprise as each student wand flew from his or her hand rinna clicked her tongue at them clearly disgruntled that she d disarmed them all this little exercise will be done without wands that evening the great hall was filled with chatter as classmates recalled strategies and brilliant ploys that had taken place that day practically all agreed that the class had been ace fred and george griped very loudly dunlevy never let us upperclassmen play games it completely unfair a few others hushed them but rinna had heard them from the head table she rolled her eyes she knew they were teasing the twins comment even though they d only been jokingly calling to question her reputation of fairness had the unforeseen effect of serving as a catalyst for the dormant what house was professor dunlevy in question speculation was rampant the next morning at breakfast and by lunchtime it was the main topic of conversation there had been a knot of slytherins huddled around malfoy all through breakfast whispering earnestly but harry hadntgiven it much thought until lunch when george and fred sat down near him hermione and ron after all for once malfoy and his cronies were keeping to themselves and not making other students lives miserable the slytherins are saying the g m was in their house fred told them quietly so ron said that what the puffs and claws are saying too who cares what they say anyway well the snakes are the only ones saying they have absolute evidence of it george noted grimly malfoy says he can prove it harry glanced up sharply malfoy what the hell does he know the twins shrugged maybe he trying to make trouble for another teacher now that hagrid back dunno doesntseem like they are trying to make trouble so much as they are bragging george jerked a thumb at the slytherin table they re acting awfully smug about it sure enough malfoy and his cronies were smirking and looking rather pleased with themselves particularly now that students from the ravenclaw table were now looking at the slytherins and then putting heads together and whispering donttell me the ravenclaws believe them ron said incredulously that ridiculous i thought they were supposed to be smart harry felt his mouth go dry he wasntsure what malfoy intentions were but he knew they couldntbe good that much was obvious malfoy had better watch himself he hissed venomously fingering his wand harry hermione warned dontyou even think of trying anything last term you were in trouble for dueling with malfoy in the halls twice he trying to smear rinna reputation harry protested professor dunlevy hermione put special emphasis on the title is very capable of defending her own reputation and you cannot afford to be spending evenings in detention if we are going to need every spare moment to figure out how to get you through the next task harry glowered at her she was right of course about rinna and about avoiding detention he flicked his glance to the slytherins and malfoy self satisfied expression made his blood boil he d just better watch what he says harry let the warning dangle ominously as he got up and slouched out of the hall hermione and ron scrambling to catch up as they made their way to afternoon classes students were mingling about after the final bell signaled the break before dinner when harry saw malfoy he stepped in front of the blond boy and challenged in a low voice and just where did you get the rubbish idea that you know what house professor dunlevy was in draco smirked and replied condescendingly it not rubbish she was in slytherin i have proof proof harry snarled what proof really potty you are being quite thick more so than usual snapped malfoy both my mother and my father told me she was in slytherin you will excuse me if i dontput much stock into what your mother and father say malfoy harry said coldly are you calling my parents liars draco asked in a low dangerous tone are you calling me a liar yes shouted harry she wasntin slytherin she played quidditch with my father and my godfather for gryffindor oh really sneered draco well there is one way to prove that potter harry snapped his fingers the trophy room he turned and began walking quickly down the hall heading toward the third floor followed by ron and hermione malfoy and his goons when they arrived harry marched directly to the gryffindor trophy case he tapped the glass with his wand and muttered the spell that brought out all the trophies from the decade in question he found the house cup for every year that his dad had been at hogwarts prominently displayed with a plaque along side it listing the names of each player on the winning house quidditch team james potter was listed on the last five as seeker he moved down the case looking for the house cup for the year after his father had graduated rinna final year where was it he murmured the trophy display spell again nothing changed harry frowned finding what you are looking for potter came a sneering drawl from over by the slytherin case harry turned to ron and hermione with puzzlement she said she was seeker when her team won the house cup right ron nodded and that she was chaser the two years before that right ron nodded again harry stooped to peer at the names on the plaques the last two years his dad was there three chasers were listed one was sirius black but none were arinna dunlevy i dontunderstand harry whispered bewildered hermione found the team photographs and scrutinized them i dontsee her in the photos harry draco voice cut across the room again still looking for her over there are you he tapped the glass of the slytherin case with a well manicured nail well well she was as easy on the eyes then as she is now shut your ruddy mouth malfoy she is not over there and you know it harry strode menacingly toward draco oh no see for yourself potter his narrow face held a sneer of pure spite harry felt rage rise in him like lava coming to the surface in a volcano ready to explode and wipe the derision off of malfoy face he felt his hands cocking into fists as he closed in on malfoy he saw crabbe and goyle step forward he tried to swing but both arms were weighted down one of his best friends on each side stopping him from doing something extremely stupid again draco absolutely secure in the knowledge that he was right and potter was wrong felt almost magnanimous as he gestured elegantly to the trophy case and stepped aside this was going to be entirely delicious to watch those know it all gryffindors were so damned cock sure of themselves were they harry eyes widened his mouth opened and closed but no words came out in his shock in the display case before him was the house cup for the year that rinna had graduated the plaque listed the names of the members of that year victorious team listed as chaser seeker was arinna dunlevy merlin she was in slytherin breathed ron pointing to the team picture rinna stood with her team in her silver and green quidditch robes smiling her happiest smile there was no mistaking the red hair falling in two thick braids down her shoulders or the green eyes flashing with excitement in her hand was the broom she had shown them last summer the silver dart the broom sirius had given her hermione harry and ron stood in stunned silence and watched as the slytherins in the picture broke rank and exuberantly congratulated each other the girls hugging the boys clapping each other on their backs waving their broomsticks in the air harry mind began to register what he was seeing she was a slytherin how could she have been in slytherin sirius fell in love with her my mum was best friends with her how could she so potter draco drawled looking extremely pleased with himself as he leaned against the trophy case ready to admit that you were mistaken or are you still going to insist that your lady love was in gryffindor what are you insinuating malfoy hermione voice was cold and dangerous oh please it obvious potty is still in shock that the teacher he has a crush on has fallen from grace in his eyes not the pure gryffindor you were hoping for hmmm scar head hermione sputtered indignantly ron growled and cocked his fists and harry glared daggers at draco as he said sod off malfoy in a taut angry voice he made to leave but crabbe and goyle moved to intercept him quicker than a blink harry wand was out impedimenta he grated out and all three slytherin boys were rooted to the spot without another glance harry swept out of the room fuming with his friends following closely at his heels a n admires the view from the cliff gee sure is nice from up here this chapter was so much fun to write i hope you enjoyed it dear reader and i would love to hear what you thought reviews lead to happiness which leads to gleeful thoughts which leads to inspiration which leads to better and more timely writing so no pressure or anything but the fate of the story could depend entirely on you gracious reviewer special thanks to those who reviewed chapter 22 seems like a million years ago doesntit lorett kerichi sophia loren sunny june 46 desiderea josephine taylor countess alecto and starfire s 19 a new definition of family chapter 24 out of sorts disclaimer i have not just completed a 17 year journey of seven novels that tell an epic story of good and evil and feature an orphaned boy wizard in other words i do not own any of jk rowling characters or any portion of the harry potter universe any characters places situations ideas spells or any properties of the sorting hat that you dontfind in her fabulous books well they belong to me the final bell found rinna in her office she didnthave any appointments but kept open office hours until dinner usually the students came in right after the bell if they needed to see her so she didntstart on her work right away but chose instead to re read sirius morning post darling gemstone i can just picture you preening in anticipation of accepting your godmother of the year award of course you handled everything with the godson just fine you ve always been ace at dealing with children i worried that the poor kid is going to give his heart away too easily and get hurt what with being starved for affection for so long by those bastard muggles loved hearing about your lesson plans mostly because i like to daydream of the kind of pranks i d pull if i was in your class or other things i d like to do i waggling my eyebrows suggestively here i probably shouldntmention the fantasies i ve been having about an almost innocent schoolboy seduced by a sophisticated and sexy professor how d your latest plan work nice to hear the project continues to go well hopefully that means you can actually pull yourself away soon and pay some attention to the pooch the house sitter is away most of the time now no doubt canoodling with the cousin you should sack him i ve put in a doggie door i dontthink there was any permanent damage to the south wall missing you terribly b while she doubted remus was gone as much as sirius implied she could tell he was lonely she wasntsure how she felt about him roaming about in his animagus form though then she silently berated herself the man had been imprisoned for years he deserved to be able to leave the house whenever he wanted even if it was only safe to do so as a big mutt she sighed she should have thought of a doggie door a long time ago rinna glanced at the clock she had just enough time to dash off a quick reply to take to the owlery after dinner and then rework some calculations on the latest modification to her potions experiment before she would be expected in the great hall for dinner dearest b i do not preen you prat and i never was ace at dealing with children but dealing with my peers now i the grown up who expected to be wise and have

watch out for the muggle animal control people we wouldntwant the pooch to end up at the pound rinna sealed the letter and leaned back in her chair a feeling of contentment settled over her and she could easily identify several reasons for it she really was rather pleased with how her relationship with harry was progressing she knew he d worked out the clue after a hurried whispered conversation after class one day also she was thoroughly enjoying teaching and believed that she d finally discovered her calling and she felt she was on the verge of working out the last little tweak needed on her project for dumbledore which meant she would be spending the weekend in the arms of her fianc even the thought of the upcoming triwizard task could not dampen her current all is right with the world feeling smiling she reached for her quill parchment and abacus and set to work hermione and ron ran after harry as he stormed through the halls to the d a d a classrooms he knew rinna kept office hours at this time he pushed through the door viciously stomping through the classroom to the smaller door that was open invitingly banging on it once with his fist as he entered the cozy little room rinna was already up from her chair in a defensive stance wand drawn before she registered that it was harry and his friends who had entered so abruptly why the bloody hell didntyou tell me you were in slytherin he yelled as he strode right up to her desk red faced eyes snapping with anger he slammed his fists on the heavy oak surface causing inkwells to jostle rinna stared at him in a split second of shock before she flicked her wand closing her office door and casting a silencing charm on the room why dontyou sit down harry everyone she said calmly as she came around from behind her desk moving chairs over with her wand i want an answer damn it he pounded his fists again why didntyou tell me you were in slytherin she walked up to him leaned a hip against the desk and faced him she studied his face for a moment before asking softly why does it matter harry harry mouth was open ready to shout again when her question sunk into his brain he closed his mouth with a snap and looked down at his fists on the desk why does it matter because you are my godmother because i just lost face in front of malfoy because ever since i met you you ve kept secret after secret from me because slytherins and gryffindors hate each other they dontbecome best friends or get engaged why does it matter i dunno it just does he said to the desk sit down harry she said again have a seat and calm down her voice was very persuasive and harry found himself moving to a chair his comrades followed suit rinna pulled the last chair around to face them her knuckles turning white as she gripped the back of it she took a deep breath to calm her nerves she had been taken by surprise somehow she had assumed or maybe she d hoped that harry had figured it out long ago and had just chosen to avoid acknowledging it that they had been working under an unstated agreement to not talk about it apparently she d been very wrong big mistake rinna girl she thought as she observed the fury painted on harry face in livid red strokes she sat down took another deep breath and prayed she wouldntfurther bugger this up again her voice was soft it shouldnt matter he spluttered it matters because because you let me believe you were in gryffindor rinna felt anger tighten around her gut at his accusatory tone despite her attempts to remain calm she d known harry had a rather deep rooted prejudice against slytherins as a result she may not have been completely forthright with him but the clues had been there for him to put together had he wanted to instead he d made assumptions her jaw tightened you believed what you chose to believe harry she snapped what is that supposed to mean he barked you believed that i was in gryffindor because you cannot even fathom the thought that your mother would lower herself to be friends with a slytherin you did not want to believe that your beloved godfather would debase himself enough to touch a slytherin let alone want to marry one her words were reproachful with bitterness underlying her tone harry opened his mouth to protest almost as soon as she d started speaking but rinna voice got louder and louder overriding him he shut his mouth slowly let his breath out and cast his eyes down to the floor what rinna said was true she stopped when she realized she was shouting and rubbed the back of her neck with a sigh then schooled her voice to the same soft impassivity she d used earlier it wasnteasy you know she said it wasnteasy in the beginning your mother and i caught all kinds of hell for it she was called every manner of filthy names subjected to cruel pranks i was in all kinds of fights and scrapes more often than not shut out of the dorms and taunted as well the trio eyes grew wide rinna locked gazes with each of them for a moment each of us was subjected to abuse by both gryffindors and slytherins she got up and moved the few steps to the bookcases in the corner as her words were absorbed by the abashed young gryffindors she turned slightly but kept most of her back to them you see when the gryffindors saw the snake insignia over my heart she placed her right hand over her left breast they refused to look any further what they thought they saw was a sneaky stuck up pureblooded bint who was born with an unnatural proclivity toward the dark arts each of the kids jerked a bit at the bluntness of her words my housemates would pick out a gryffindor and manage to see only a self righteous self aggrandizing blood traitor who swaggered about boasting and blindly playing the hero or else they just saw a mudblood she turned around to look at them they were shocked nothing has really changed in twenty years now has it there was a long awkward silence and harry began to feel his hot rage start to simmer down to mere anger and indignation the trio squirmed in their seats discomfited by the quiet well rinna you might as well finish what you started she returned to her seat and leaned forward elbows on her knees and studied her hands as she played with the ruby ring that she d switched to her right hand for discretionary reasons i never meant to fall for a gryffindor and i sure a slytherin was the last person sirius expected to fall in love with but who can argue with the heart she lifted her head to look at harry sirius and i had to sneak around for almost a year after we started going out in order to keep our unholy relationship a secret we kept it undercover until i became an upperclassman the belligerent tilt to harry chin softened just a little but the sharpness in his eyes told rinna that no matter what she said tonight this rift would not be easily mended in one evening the contrast between this moment and the euphoria she d felt before the confrontation was as keen as a knife blade rinna cleared her throat and glanced at the clock on her desk she stood up well you three i was working on something that needs to be done before dinner when you slammed your way into my office ron and hermione simultaneously began to stammer out apologies rinna leaned back against her desk and eyed all of them seriously harry and you too ron and hermione i will be blunt here you are completely intolerant of anything slytherin to a fault all things are not divided between red and green and it time you opened your minds a little rinna observed the slightly mutinous set to each kid jaw at this suggestion she knew from experience that old prejudices did not die easily she sighed and ran her hand through her hair look i d be a hypocrite if i told you that you should never hate anyone but before you despise someone make sure that he or she merits that kind of intensity of emotion because the energy you expend on hatred could be put to better and more powerful uses she looked at them all kindly do you understand what i mean silence reigned for a moment before they nodded solemnly and made to leave harry trailed the others and he cast one last reproving look at his godmother before stepping out of the office when she heard the distant click of the classroom door latching rinna walked around her desk and sat down resting her head in her hands by jupiter moons is this the way it will always be with me and harry with him finding out something he thinks i should have told him and resenting me for it she shook her head how many times would this happen before he wouldntforgive her she hoped fervently that it wasnt this time sighing she slowly reached for the letter to sirius broke the seal turned over the parchment and began to write cor harry what did that pork chop ever do to you george said quietly pointing his fork at harry plate imagining it malfoy face are you fred added knowingly harry made a non committal growl and continued savaging his dinner ron leaned over to his brothers and noted in a low voice malfoy does have proof the twins brows rose in unison trophy room she was definitely in slytherin blimey fred breathed how d you find out george asked harry viciously stabbed some green beans in hushed tones hermione gave them the abridged version of what happened fred and george looked impressed you stormed into her office like that that took balls mate she could ve hexed you into oblivion fred commented there were several seconds of silence course it makes sense if you think about it george mused i mean look at that broom she got and she knows a lot about the dark arts added fred and she was pretty damned sneaky all the things she used to do to us in class right and dontforget she speaks parseltongue not to mention she looks smashing in green there was a loud clatter as harry threw his fork and knife onto his plate he stood abruptly and left the great hall without a word rinna had been watching the gryffindors all through dinner and while her eyes followed him to the door her impassive expression never changed dinner must be over by now sirius thought a few days later as he paced the living room and he pictured rinna walking from the great hall to her quarters before stepping into the fireplace how she had finagled a friday night temporary floo connection on such short notice he did not know but he was grateful that he did not need to wait till saturday morning to see his lover he was also pleased that upset over her rift with harry he was the person she had turned to first their relationship was growing more and more despite the physical distance between them sirius reached out and gripped rinna arm steadying her as she entered the room with a tell tale whoosh of green flame thanks rinna gasped as she stumbled into him he put his arms around her to keep her from falling hey just stay here a minute until your head stops spinning sirius admonished as she tried to push herself out of his embrace i ve got you she sunk back against his chest and allowed him to support her she chuckled into his jumper i dontsee how this will help blackie being in such close proximity to you just makes my head spin even more sirius grinned and kissed the top of her head ah i ve missed you my silver tongued seductress rinna laughed and gave him a squeeze before stepping back to look up at him she rose on her tip toes to give him a peck on the lips a rascally look crossed his face and he took her in his arms again and dipped her back as if they were dancing he smirked as she gave a little shriek and kissed her soundly now that more like the greeting i was hoping for he remarked as he returned her to an upright position indeed her brow arched as her eyes snapped accepting the challenge is this one of those fantasies you told me about blackie she fisted her hand in the front of his jumper and pulled his lips to hers they lost themselves in an episode of passionate snogging before he pulled away slightly and responded it certainly is the start of one of them anyway rinna laughed throatily before pulling him to her again the kisses had a sense of urgency to them now her hands roamed over him as she insistently parted his mouth with her tongue sending a jolt of desire through him sirius felt a change in the tension of her body as she slipped her hands under his clothes and moved her lips down his neck and it reminded him of what wrong love he peered at her deeply concerned at the distressed look on her face just kiss me sirius she whispered desperately fill my head with you and only you she pressed herself to him and crashed her mouth to his he gently pushed her away and looked into her wild eyes what wrong what happened he watched her face pinch as the compulsion spell took over i canttell you she panted but i need to get it out of my head memories i need you she tugged at his belt his clothing in a way that set him on fire and left no doubt as to what she meant by needing him he kissed her fervently she hissed her approval yesss blackie he moved his mouth to her ear and growled i ll take care of you baby the smirk on sirius face widened as her clever and persistent hands swiftly divested him of unnecessary clothing naturally he returned the favor but before he could suggest they move the few feet to the couch he found himself pinned to the rug in front of the hearth well that was a blast from the past sirius drawled lazily sometime later i almost want to thank harry for causing you distress she lifted her head from his chest face creased in puzzlement what are you talking about this he swept his hand dramatically down their entwined forms it was just like back then he explained when you d come back from an assignment and well you couldnttalk about it so you sought to ah alleviate your stress in other he tried to state it delicately well let say you found solace in more physical ways he watched her mouth drop in surprise and comprehension only now there is no compulsion stopping you from discussing what is bothering you he caressed her cheek dawning horror filled her eyes sun moon and stars sirius i used you she tried to free herself but he circled her waist and held her to him she struggled pushing against his chest listen to me rinna at his tone her eyes snapped to his wide and bemused he shook his head with a slight smile i was what all of nineteen twenty my girlfriend would come home jump me and shag me senseless i wasntcomplaining but i used you again just now i still not complaining he noted voice rising in volume to override her there nothing wrong with that you seeking comfort in that way and if i can offer you that consolation i will a slight leer crept over his countenance repeatedly if necessary she continued to look at him in wonder although the edges of her mouth twitched upward a bit at his last remark nevertheless he continued as he stood up and offered her his hand i think now is a good time for me to demonstrate that my ears work just as impressively as other parts of my anatomy she snorted in amusement as he helped her to her feet sirius pulled her into a loose embrace and tipped his forehead carefully against hers do you want to talk about harry rinna nodded so he took her hand led her to the couch and draped an afghan around her so he began covering himself as well before conjuring a bottle of wine and two glasses how are things with harry rinna mouth scrunched into a grimace and rather than sitting she began to pace the living room in a word frosty she sighed he stopped making a point to walk by and say goodbye as he leaves the classroom any interaction we have in class is very formal he avoids looking at me in the great hall she returned to the couch sat down gracelessly and accepted the glass he offered bringing it to her lips inattentively i just dontknow what to do about it once he realizes that it really isntfair to be upset with you for something you couldnthelp being sorted into slytherin he ll come around he slung his arm around her shoulders and squeezed reassuringly i wish it was that simple that all he was troubled about was me being slytherin she sighed i afraid it is more than that i think he feels i kept it a secret from him and in all honesty i did not consciously really she turned to him but i firmly believe sirius that one factor in my sorting to slytherin was because secrets and deception and confabulation were already so ingrained into me rinna and that is what is bothering me her face became pinched it so ingrained into me into my psyche sirius she laughed hollowly no wonder i was so valuable to the order bitterness hung on her tongue i cantdivorce myself from that part of me and it will always be that way with harry and me always i will always have secrets and he will never trust me her shoulders slumped in defeat sirius finally understood he pulled her into his arms he will rinna he will she pressed her face to his chest muffling her words you know this about me you accept this about me harry will accept it he kissed the top of her head he will understand she shook her head i ll talk to him baby she pulled back to look at him askance what i ll talk to him he saw her eyebrows rise skeptically what you dontthink i can pull off the godparent thing too well i well what will you say to him one side of his mouth turned up neatly sidestepping the question are we i wonttell him anything you dontwant me to he held her gaze trust me ruby she looked at him for several heartbeats i do blackie she breathed she leaned once more into his embrace and he pulled her flush against him and held her tightly pressing kisses into her hair rinna clung to her lover grateful once again for the stroke of luck or divine intervention that he was the man who loved her that he had by some miracle been able to see past the old prejudices all those years ago ever so slyly dumbledore voice slipped into her thoughts love my dear arinna love is the one thing that will hold back the darkness be it the darkness in this world or the darkness in one soul and merlin knew she loved sirius she raised her cheek from his chest and inclined her face toward him i love you she whispered when rinna lifted her chin sirius accepted the invitation feeling the subtle shift in the atmosphere of the room once more as he parted her lips with his and kissed her deeply her lips stretched into a smile against his firm demanding mouth i didntrealize you would offer your comforting services again so soon she murmured let just say that i have ulterior motives ruby his grin was positively lascivious i ve been bereft of your charms for too long mon amoureux romancing me in foreign languages now are you my gilded tongued gryffindor she chuckled mmmm he agreed as he shifted her against him pressing her closer it a well known fact that women swoon when spoken to by their lovers in french her laugh was deep and throaty and sent shockwaves straight to his groin is that so i think i need to test that theory blackie sirius kissed his way along her jaw line to her ear before whispering huskily voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir her eyes slid shut as her stomach turned back flips sweet mother of morgana she exclaimed hoarsely you were right he pulled her up from the couch and began to walk her backwards toward the bedroom votre reponse s il vous plait he mouthed against her ear she responded the only way she could oui mon amour harry we need to talk can you meet me at the same place as in november same time this wednesday sirius it was very quiet in the gryffindor common room the flames leapt up and turned emerald green and suddenly sirius face was in the fire it wasntso startling this time harry threw a pillow down and knelt in front of the fireplace hello sirius hello harry sirius face glowed green how are you okay i reckon sirius looked skeptical and where are you at with the second task harry gave a little shrug i ve figured out the clue in the egg i to go under the lake to search for something and i ll have an hour to find it so i need to be able to breathe underwater for an hour his eyebrows came together in worry d you know any spell for that sirius well sirius said thoughtfully you could try the bubble head charm you should be able to find it in any fifth year textbook in the library only only what the charm itself isntdifficult and you d have no trouble with it harry the tricky part is maintaining the air inside the bubble that much more advanced magic harry frowned well i ve done advanced magic before you know he said huffily i did save your life by conjuring a pat yes a full and magnificent patronus i know sirius smiled kindly at his godson who was obviously in a prickly mood i wasntdisparaging your abilities harry i was merely expressing concern that you would not have enough time to master the spell for manufacturing the air which isnttaught until fifth year and the trickiest part would be maintaining it for an entire hour it is tough magic for most even very skilled wizards he grinned take for your example your godmother i think the most she ever managed to make it last was about fifteen minutes and she no slouch when it comes to magical abilities that one the irritated scowl on harry face deepened as he huffed out air in frustration at being so close to a solution only to have it seem impossible how long could you maintain it sirius he let out a bark of laughter around thirty minutes that used to hack her off no end his grin was roguish which goes to prove that brilliance in one area of magic doesntnecessarily mean competency in others it like any skill i suppose not everyone can be good at everything now can they harry nodded he was reminded of a conversation last summer rinna told me that she wasntvery good at legilimency either that it gives her a headache to do it but she good at the other thing er occular occlumency sirius corrected absently so she finally learned legilimency did she he mused huh harry studied his godfather doesntthat bother you sirius raised his brows doesnt what bother me that she knows how to do something i don t no doesntit bother you that you didntknow that about her that she never told you ah now we are getting to it and it was harry who had neatly steered the conversation to the place sirius had wanted to go is that why you re giving her the cold shoulder harry because she didnttell you she d been sorted slytherin he asked gently it not just that harry said hotly and he began to tick off rinna offenses on his fingers she didnteven tell me she was my godmother when we met nor that you and she had been engaged she let me find those things out through her picture album she failed to mention that she already knew you had been framed for wormtail murder and she didnttell me that she was considering the offer to teach at hogwarts he was in full fury now not to mention how did i learn she was a parselmouth oh yes that right when she started speaking to snakes in front of me and half my year mates which was in a very dire situation that resulted from you dueling in the halls if i not mistaken harry sirius reminded him quietly she d never have revealed that particular skill otherwise that exactly my point sirius she never even would have told me if that hadnthave happened sirius held up a hand tell me something do you go around telling people that you speak parseltongue of course not harry snorted it was bad enough in second year when everyone thought i was the heir of slytherin because i spoke to that snake during the dueling cl oh he had the grace to look abashed okay i see what you are saying his eyes rested on the stone of the hearth i can see why she might not tell me that but all the other stuff and the slytherin thing sirius cut him off what you need to know about your godmother harry is she a person who has had to hold many things close to the vest all her life he heaved a sigh even people she trusted her mother and dumbledore instructed her to keep certain things private her age when she entered hogwarts for example you could say she was indoctrinated in the need to be secretive i not saying it was a good thing or bad i just telling you the way things were the way things are he ran a hand through his hair i know you think she trying to be cagey but please understand that with our rinna she behaving the only way she knows how sirius watched as harry silently contemplated his words think about this harry after all the painstaking work the both of you have put into forging a relationship do you honestly think that she would consciously risk losing your trust or your affection harry creased his brows he hadntconsidered that when he thought about it and his heart began to beat a little faster at this it suddenly seemed obvious that she cared about him maybe even loved him too much to deliberately damage their relationship he shook his head ruefully he d been so angry at rinna that he hadntstopped to consider why she might not have told him well told him any of the things he d discovered what sirius said made sense and yet it piqued his curiosity about his godmother even more why is she like that sirius what happened to her it not my story to tell he replied quietly i ve already given you hints about her life but the rest rinna will have to tell you when she is ready a frown of concentration flitted across his face as harry fought to remember what sirius had told him about rinna a chill crept up his spine as a horrifying possibility occurred to him her father her father was a death eater wasnthe his words came out slowly as he turned over the idea in his mind and he still alive sirius head came up sharply as he pierced harry with his gaze everyone keeps secrets harry he remarked pointedly i sure you know this first hand just never doubt that rinna loves you his eyes softened a bit in the green glow of the fire i think she was a bit hurt that you were so upset about the slytherin thing that you d let that override everything else you know about her the boy heart panged at his godfather soft admonishment she said i was intolerant of all things slytherin he mumbled sirius nodded for what it worth i used to feel the same way myself and then you met rinna harry cocked his head in curiosity oh i still felt the same way the older wizard chuckled but then she started to grow on me sirius smirked and finally one night i kissed her and my paradigm shifted harry grinned at this is that the old fashioned way of saying she rocked your world he asked cheekily is this any way to talk to your incredibly wise godfather sirius growled harry laughed and as to her being in slytherin i dontknow how you missed the clues his voice took on a teasing tone that gown she wore to the yule ball should have been a dead giveaway malfoy words rushed back to harry if slytherin green werentalready my favorite color he closed his eyes in chagrin at the irony that he d spent a good portion of the evening trying to convince himself that she wasntwearing slytherin colors his eyes flew open as another thought occurred to him hang on how do you know what she was wearing that night he asked suspiciously his eyes widened you were here sirius chuckled smugly please harry rinna and i mastered the art of the furtive rendezvous as teenagers you know we really had no choice at the beginning she mentioned that you had to sneak around he grimaced that sucks looking back it was easier then at least we were in the same place now though a glum expression replaced sirius smirk seeing it made harry feel rather dejected i sorry after a few moments silence harry shook off his melancholy it struck him that sirius hadntbeen sad only because he was missing his fianc e he d been troubled that harry and rinna were on the outs too harry hated to see sirius upset look sirius i i going to talk to her apologize for being a prat about the whole thing good man his godfather looked pleased well it very late harry i should let you get some sleep he cocked his eyebrow at the boy this was a pretty successful man to man talk eh harry laughed you did a good job godfather he got up from his knees bye sirius goodnight oh and harry would you deliver a message for me harry bent back down to the fire and bobbed his head when you talk to rinna will you tell her i said well just tell her i miss her harry nodded gravely i will the next morning harry overslept and missed breakfast so it was not until the mid morning break in classes that he was able to tell ron and hermione about his conversation with sirius the bubble head charm just might do the trick harry hermione said excitedly of course we ll have to do more research on it but we still have time both boys snickered and rolled their eyes affectionately at their friend before harry recounted the rest of his meeting with his godfather then he ate the muffins ron had saved for him as they digested all he told them if we had been sorted into different houses what do you think would have happened would we still have been friends i mean hermione asked quietly ron shrugged i d like to think so sides the only person who might ve been sorted elsewhere is you to ravenclaw harry and i d still be gryffindors lots of eagles and lions are friends it wouldntbe something remarkable like harry mum and prof er the g m being mates he snorted it not like any of us would have been sorted to slytherin anyway harry became very quiet and made sure he did not look at either of them he shoved the rest of the muffin in his mouth and chewed slowly ron turned to him so are you going to go see her after classes then harry nodded and swallowed his late breakfast how are you going to approach her you need to work on a strategy are you going to make an appointment with her y know give her some advanced warning or just go see her after the bell well i cantjust barge into her office right because you ve done that before and we all know how well that turned out ron smirked harry scowled thank you ron the red head shrugged i just saying i think you should come up with a likely reason for needing to go see her mate it ll make things less uncomfortable harry thought about the suggestion yeah maybe i ll see if i can come up with something we should go with him ron hermione stated he scowled he a big boy hermione he doesntneed us to hold his hand does he she frowned disapprovingly i meant ronald that we probably owe her an apology too oh ron scratched the back of his head abashed uh yeah i reckon you re right harry felt a little better yeah that d be great at least i wontfeel like the only complete tosser having to apologize for being a prat he gave his friends a weak smile hermione smacked him lightly on the arm charming what are friends for ron added brightly rinna walked distractedly toward her classroom office she d just spent her free period checking on her potions project it was completely bollixed of course she wasntentirely surprised given how preoccupied and upset she d been but the setback still irritated her she scowled she d been so close to getting it she was sure damn it all to buggering hell she swore as she pushed the classroom door open to find three pairs of startled eyes gawping at her her godson and his friends were apparently waiting for office hours just brilliant first time he approached me in days and i cursing like a muggle sailor she struggled to remove the scowl from her face and school her expression to polite inquiry hullo she said what can i do for you three harry swallowed fervently hoping that she hadntbeen reacting to the sight of him uh i was hoping that is harry has an extra credit project he wanted to ask your help with hermione supplied helpfully right harry is that so rinna asked coolly why did she sound so so professional harry couldntfind a trace of her godmother persona at all sirius was right i really must ve hurt her feelings uh yeah i need to learn how to do the bubble head charm and why dontyou all come in my office rinna interrupted brusquely she needed a moment to collect her thoughts harry had just thrown her into even more of a predicament she realized he was asking for help for his next task he d given her the perfect excuse to ignore the rules but she couldnthelp be disappointed that he was acting as if nothing was amiss between them she went to her desk and sat down indicating they should take seats she closed and soundproofed the door again were you given this assignment by professor flitwick she asked he fidgeted well he hesitated for some reason not wanting to lie to his godmother harry she sighed you know that i not permitted to help you with the triwizard tournament he nodded unhappily i wish that werentthe case because i really would like to help her tone still held no warmth harry shoulders slumped the detached woman he d first met was back and he only had himself to blame he d blown it again he realized it had been a mistake thinking that asking her for something would ease the tension between them well he d told sirius he was going to apologize so he probably should just get on with it before he buggered this up more look harry squirmed in his seat then took a deep breath he focused on some books on her shelves i wanted to tell you i sorry for barging into your office last week and for yelling at you like i did and for swearing i see her words were clipped is that the reason you were waiting for me then harry nodded well i appreciate you coming by to tell me this harry her voice still sounded horribly professor like to harry ears she gathered some parchments into a stack if that is all i will see you at harry head jerked no wait he bit his lip rinna looked at him the picture of courteous interest that not all i uh he stopped and took another breath to collect himself the thing is when i talked to sirius last night well he seemed miserable without you he told me to tell you he misses you he saw his godmother face soften rinna should have realized that harry would inevitably unravel her carefully woven detachment he d pulled out the sirius trump card and won the hand encouraged he went on he also told me about how you two had to sneak around at school only he said it was easier then than now because at least you were both in the same place rinna shook her head emphatically proximity notwithstanding it never was easy carrying on a secret relationship she said quietly there was a group of people who would have objected much more to our being sweethearts than even to me and lily being friends we had to be so very careful and it was stressful and nerve wracking it was also rather thrilling to be honest rinna girl best not say that out loud though but at least back then the consequences for getting caught wouldnthave been as dire as now and now i worry for him all the time wondering if he ll be seen if he ll be caught wondering if the dementors will she couldntcontinue harry couldntmeet her eyes her words had struck him in the gut she and sirius were once again forced into clandestine meetings furtive rendezvous and surreptitious communications in order to resume their relationship and who knew what sort of trickery they d have to use to get married he couldnthelp but rage at the unfairness of it and it was back then too they should have been able to walk around holding hands and making googly eyes at each other instead of sneaking around it not fair that you and he had to hide your relationship at school just because some people were so intolerant he scraped his gaze off the floor and lifted it to hers i sorry rinna saw the sincerity in his verdant eyes filling in where his oblique apology for his narrow mindedness did not an invisible tether locked their gazes together for a long moment the tension around her eyes and mouth lessened and then to harry utter amazement her lips twitched into an irreverent grin you shouldntbe she said amusedly i firmly believe that what brought your mum and dad together harry looked completely confused hermione knit her brows together and ron speaking for the first time said lamely come again rinna laughed you see lily and james spent so much time scheming ways to cover for the two of us cooking up excuses for our sudden disappearances or lateness to class redirecting boys or girls who were vying for our affections orchestrating little rendezvous at hogsmeade the list goes on but anyway they spent so much time together as allies in our worthy cause that they ended up falling head over heels for each other harry absorbed this information and then grinned i suppose he said slowly you could say that i owe my existence to you and sirius then she grinned back exactly so i expect a two kilo box of honeydukes finest dark chocolates for christmas next year mister she teased everyone laughed and the strain in the atmosphere eased finally harry heart lightened he knew he d been forgiven but the smile on harry face soon slipped and became a pensive frown instead he voiced the question that had plagued him for the past week rinna if tension was that high between gryffindor and slytherin how did you and my mum become friends to begin with your mum harry was special she was one of those sorts that everyone likes she made friends easily and genuinely cared about others and she d already made friendships in slytherin before i ever came along rinna noted the surprise on harry face oh yes i wasnther first she smiled but something just clicked with us we werentjust casual friends we became thick as thieves nearly inseparable and we werentsubtle we paraded the relationship in front of the whole school not intentionally mind you we just couldnthelp it so our friendship as public and close as it was stirred up far more ire than any of the others hermione wondered but if things were so bad like you told us the other day why did you and lily stay friends why didntyou just give up rinna eyes grew unfocused her smile dreamy because we were two stubborn red heads who didntgive a grindylow arse what anyone else thought she replied harry mother and i were kindred spirits we were so similar in many ways we used to joke that we were twins separated at birth she laughed softly we couldntfathom the idea of not being friends with the other we made each other better she refocused her gaze on harry simply put we needed each other lily and i like the earth needs sunshine nothing could break that bond a contemplative silence filled the room rinna smiled fondly at them you three know what i mean you feel it too she observed softly yeah ron bobbed his head vigorously harry nodded too and hermione smiled rinna let out a long breath and looked significantly at hermione i dontsuppose you have the same extra credit assignment that harry does do you hermione she watched the girl brows come together in confusion before her eyes widened in comprehension rinna jotted something on a scrap of parchment and handed it to her because if you did this book in the library would help you learn more about the bubble head charm and if you needed practical help you could come see me a sly grin curved hermione lips yes i think that would be very helpful thank you and of course you lads would be more than welcome to watch her practice with me rinna eyed harry and ron pointedly huh ron asked why would hermione need to learn the oh he grinned craftily yeah i think harry and i would really enjoy watching her practice wouldntyou say mate he elbowed his friend harry bestowed his high voltage smile on his godmother brilliant rinna dramatically placed her hand on her chest occasionally i am she stated with mock humility the trio laughed and got up to leave harry tailed his friends but before he was completely out the door he stopped his hand resting on the doorjamb rinna heard him tell the others quietly you go on i ll see you in the great hall okay he turned and stepped back into the office but he did not raise his head rinna harry said keeping his eyes on his shoes did you ever think you d been sorted into the wrong house there was a long silence before her heavy sigh brought his gaze to her face yes and no i think it safe to say that many of my professors wondered why i hadntbeen sorted into ravenclaw and it was a nice little fantasy to have that i d been mis sorted because things just would have been so much easier you know with your mum and with sirius if i hadntbeen in slytherin she caught his eyes but now that i have the benefit of retrospect the sorting hat even though it took a long time to make its decision made no mistake that night in sorting me to slytherin why he wondered softly it was rinna turn to drop her gaze secrets harry she whispered from the earliest time i can remember i was forced to keep secrets donttell your mother this donttell your father that and there were things that happened experiences that i i knew i could never disclose some things i couldntreveal for fear of my safety or the safety of people i loved her voice trailed off sadly she lifted her eyes to him again the point is i arrived at hogwarts at the tender age of ten so well versed in the art of being sly furtive surreptitious and covert and not to mention cunning the very things that old salazar had prized that it no wonder what house i ended up in not to mention the factor that lineage played into the equation she thought although really that didntalways tell true sirius was a prime example of that no she stated answering harry original question no i was placed exactly where i should have been not completely satisfied harry pressed but did you want to be in slytherin she looked at him strangely he is having more difficulty accepting that i was a serpent than i d hoped i pictured myself in ravenclaw actually but it doesntmatter what a person wants harry the sorting hat places him or her in the house they are best suited for but it does matter harry contradicted why didntyou just tell the hat where you wanted to be tell it rinna began to feel very unsettled you dont tell the hat where you want to go it tells you her words came out more sharply than she intended but i did his godmother was looking at him as if he d sprouted tentacles before her eyes feeling flustered he amended well not exactly i told the hat where i didnt want to go where you didntwant to go she echoed in a faint voice harry nodded and what happened it put me in gryffindor instead rinna was stunned silent a long standing belief had just been shattered wizarding kids were told that the hat sorted you to the house you should be in what if the sorting isntmeant to be some passive ritual is that how sirius ended up in gryffindor instead of slytherin but surely he would have said something she took several deep breaths to calm herself her brain didnttake the hint the hat took a long time with me what if it was waiting for some indication from me even a subconscious one was it in my power to go to another house i was sure my family lines would automatically place me in slytherin she shook her head to clear her desultory thoughts she was almost successful until a seditious little tendril emerged from the most closely guarded recesses of her mind was it in my power to defy my father no rinna burst out startling harry so badly he jumped she cast him an embarrassed look i sorry harry it just difficult for me to believe he shrugged uncomfortable that he had obviously upset her again she peered at him intently whatever gave you the idea to tell the hat that you didntwant to go she trailed off her face turned mordant i ll bet i can guess which house it was you didntwant to go to she said sardonically harry looked abashed but said defensively i d heard that slytherin house produced the most dark wizards and i d had a few encounters with malfoy i just knew i didntwant to be there she sighed it is true of course that many slytherin house alumni went on to uh darker leanings she ran her fingers over her mouth in thought and you just told the hat she shook her head in wonder i didntknow i wasntsupposed to he protested which is precisely the conundrum harry does the hat take personal preferences into consideration should we tell it what we want does that change the magic in some way her mind was decidedly boggled harry ran a hand through his hair i dunno i had no idea what was going to happen that night when they marched us into the great hall i saw the hat and thought he looked sheepish i thought we were going to have to pull a rabbit out of it or something there were two seconds of silence before rinna laughed out loud harry chagrin washed face smiled a little it was funny now rinna laugh turned to an ironic chuckle so it seems neither of us knew better you didntknow enough about the ceremony to not ask and i knew so much that i didnteven think to ask she shook her head this is going to tumble in my head and keep me awake tonight i afraid the room was quiet until harry dared to ask so then you still think you werentput in the wrong her abrupt hand motion cut him off what done is done and quite frankly you will find that down the road it really doesntmatter anyway at least it didntmatter to me until you brought all this up tonight she crossed her arms and regarded him steadily i think the question i more interested in is can we get past this harry his voice was soft i want to she nodded i do too right harry shuffled his feet i ve been a git i sorry that i hurt your feelings she crossed to him and put a hand on his shoulder the other tilted his chin up as she caught his eyes i ll get over it she smiled gently and she pulled him into a hug harry wrapped his arms around her in relief she gave him a brief squeeze and then stepped back and winked at him make sure you eat enough dinner before you help hermione find that book and start on her bubble head research she admonished with a wily quirk of her mouth harry smiled right well i ll see you at dinner he stepped out into the corridor shaking his head over how much rinna had sounded like a mum while still sneakily giving him the assistance he needed for the next triwizard task without breaking the rules he stopped abruptly his godmother really was brilliant and sly and cunning and all those other things she d said maybe she really did belong in slytherin and for the first time in over a week the thought did not bother him at all a n i am not a speaker of french so i hope i didntbutcher the language too much in this chapter mon amoureux my lover voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir roughly i want you to go to

characters places situations ideas charms and spells or anything else that you dontfind in her fabulous books well they belong to me it no good harry hermione looked at the stopwatch in frustration as harry and ron broke the bubble head charm gasping a little twenty minutes is the best any of us has done she cast ron a worried look you ll just have to come up for air is all ron tried to sound heartening except we dontknow if harry will even be in a position to do that harry looked around the empty d a d a classroom where rinna had allowed them to practice for the last two weeks she had stayed at first demonstrating and practicing right along with them working on strategies to increase the sustainability of the charm but after a few days she d regretfully told them she had something she was working on for dumbledore that she really could not put off longer and had left them to it i donthave any other hints to give you three i ve taught you everything i can about it now you have to practice and see if you can modify it to your own magic hermione tried to protest listen rinna said you have to remember that it is like any other skill practice can get you so far but if you donthave the innate ability to go along with it harry made a sound of objection she turned to him take for example harry a distance runner there are a few people who can run a 5k in fifteen minutes that is amazingly fast she paused as hermione explained to ron what a 5k was however i will never be able to run five kilometers in less than twenty five minutes even when i was in my best shape i couldn t i have neither the body type nor the inborn ability to run any faster no matter how much i train there is a barrier i cannot push past she studied each of the students in turn do you see what i saying harry sighed guys i think we need to come up with a plan b thank you ludo for that thorough explanation of all the second task will entail albus dumbledore said smoothly it was the evening of the twenty third of february and the entire staff of hogwarts and the visiting schools was gathered in the staff room most were still absorbing the details that had just been set forth but dumbledore noted one teacher in particular was glowering quite fiercely he smiled to himself recalling ludo bagman bafflement over professor dunlevy continued disapproval of the triwizard tournament he cleared his throat madam pomfrey will naturally be on hand to administer restorative potions to the participants and the hostages he paused at rinna derisive snort and the merfolk have agreed to assist if any of our champions run into trouble however his countenance became quite serious i feel that it is important that we have a human in the water as well because the merpeople not being terribly familiar with human beings may not recognize signs of distress right away several people nodded in agreement so ludo bagman said brightly as he clapped his hands together which of you can swim much discussion took place all at once but it soon came to light that there were few in the room who could be considered adequate swimmers professor dunlevy was completely and thoroughly incensed and was too busy wallowing in her fury to take part in the current debate the ministry had gone too far the risks were enormous hypothermia attacks by squid or grindylows or merlin knew what not to mention drowning and how was harry to manage he wouldntbe able to come up to the surface for air several times if he was to go to the bottom of the lake would he just how deep was the lake anyway fear for her godson gripped her heart and made her even more irascible she was only dimly aware that dumbledore had stopped next to her chair and placed a hand on her shoulder the scowl on the redheaded woman face made bagman take an involuntary step backward dumbledore did not appear to notice it i seem to recall arinna he noted in a casual voice a dare that once inspired you to swim across the lake one june his lips twitched slightly as he added that escapade resulted in one of the more interesting group detentions in hogwarts history if memory serves me right rinna looked up at him incredulously you cantbe serious we need someone in the water he said gently that was swimming on the surface not diving to the depths albus and it was almost twenty years ago blue eyes bore into her angry ones you are arguably the person with the most athletic prowess in the room arinna he was resorting to flattery she knew and it irritated her more i cantstay under water for more than twenty minutes she snapped and only that long thanks to practicing with the kids the bubble head charm is not one of my strongest skills i may be of some assistance in regards to that minor obstacle a smooth voice insinuated itself into the conversation severus snape leaned forward to capture the headmaster attention and rinna was convinced she saw a smarmy smug expression on his face in reaction to her admission of weakness the git at dumbedore nod snape continued i have some gillyweed in my stores enough to be adequate for your needs i sure he turned to rinna i believe that answers all your objections does it not her eyes narrowed why the hell dont you do it then his black eyes snapped he did not like admitting to weakness any more than she did i cannot swim more than a few feet i sink like a stone rinna glared daggers at him i will certainly file that tidbit away for future reference she hissed quietly for his ears only she stood up and slapped her hands on the table fine i will be in the water for this thrice cursed idiot inspired misadventure she turned on her heel and stalked like a wet cat from the room slamming the door behind her snape eyes followed her a slight smirk touching his lips as he observed her discomfiture that went well wouldntyou say dumbledore smiled to a wide eyed ludo bagman eight thirty the next morning found rinna pacing the far shore of the lake where the stands from the first task had been set up she hadntslept a wink but professionalism had regained the upper hand her face bore a veneer of calm detachment after her embarrassingly immature display of temper last night she determined she would be nothing but calm cool and collected this morning it was just as well she had made this resolution because it wasntlong before she saw dumbledore and snape approaching arinna my dear severus has informed me of a rather unfortunate situation it would appear that there is no longer any gillyweed in my stores snape informed her with a carefully neutral expression you told me you had enough gillyweed snape nodded rinna made an exasperated noise really severus i thought you were much more meticulous about keeping inventory of your cupboards i know precisely to the ounce every ingredient he snapped the item in question has obviously been pilfered you donthave any at all rinna was appalled as the news sunk in that is what i have been saying was the short reply she looked at him well now what am i going to do snape sneered at her i hope you have brushed up on the bubble head charm dunlevy i have no other suggestions he turned and walked away dumbledore cleared his throat i sure you will be fine arinna just come up for air whenever you need to rinna watched as the headmaster returned to the gold draped judges table she shook her head the problem with the triwizard tournament she decided sourly was it wasntbeing run by women by nine fifteen three of the four champions were on the shore preparing in various ways for the task ahead rinna had transfigured her shoes into diving fins and was now pacing and slapping them against her thighs as she craned her head to see if she could spot her godson making his way around the lake by nine twenty she was more than a little concerned after all neither hermione nor ron had been available to wake him as both were at the bottom of the lake as hostages at nine twenty six she was striding purposefully toward the gilded judges table when she heard someone shout there he is sure enough a dark haired figure was sprinting pell mell along the shore rinna breathed a sigh of relief and started casting the warming charms she would need in the water while all eyes were on harry as he was doubled over catching his breath she quietly waded into the water and slipped on her fins as bagman lined the champions along the shore she cast the charm she was quite heartily tired of and slipped below the surface to wait the trill of the starting whistle pierced the morning air at nine thirty one rinna silently cast her final spell one to enhance auditory faculties so as to allow her better hearing under water she watched the students wade in and cast their various charms fleur and cedric used the bubble head charm and viktor transfigured himself into a shark well the upper half of him anyway although incomplete the transfiguration appeared to be effective the three older champions swam away only harry legs were visible standing still up to the knees in the cold water what was he waiting for suddenly he flopped gracelessly face forward into the water and began to kick his feet had become strangely longer resembling rinna transfigured diving fins he turned around once to stare at them and his now webbed hands before haring off after the others at more than human speed rinna snorted the mysterious disappearance of the gillyweed had been solved rinna estimated that roughly thirty minutes had passed she d already surfaced once and fervently hoped that all would go well so once more was all she d need before the task was over she d spent the time swimming from the spot on the lake bottom where the hostages were held to her pleasant surprise one of the merfolk a young male had led her there just after the task had started to the water weed beds where she d seen the grindylows and back she had seen one student sized shape swimming in the right direction dark and indistinct in the murky water and was expecting to see more when she heard odd sounds although not accustomed to listening in the water she was sure something was wrong and swiveled her head to determine what direction the sounds were coming from she began to swim quickly as she could toward the weed beds visibility became worse so she was practically on top of the scene of the trouble before she even noticed it fleur delacour long blonde hair had been pulled from its plait as she struggled with the grindylows it was flashing pale green in the murky light of the lake as the girl twisted and thrashed in her attempts to stun and strike the attacking creatures never had rinna seen so many of the water demons in one place nor so riled she pulled her wand from the sheath on her forearm and cast several spells before realizing the viscosity of the water was distorting the magic and would force her to move closer the grindylows sensed a new presence and several turned to investigate their wicked teeth flashing rinna cursed mentally and threw more spells even as she kicked her finned feet before locking gazes with fleur there was panic now in fleur eyes and rinna knew why her struggle against the water demons was rapidly using her oxygen supply and rinna was now in exactly the same situation she d been under the water at least ten minutes already perhaps more several grindylows nipped at her legs while others grabbed her arms she needed to end this now she absently kicked at the creatures near her legs as she mentally rehearsed the wand movement needed it had been a long time since she d cast a stunning spell as strong as this one and how much the water would hinder it she didntknow still she needed to hit all the demons at once even if it meant knocking the french champion out as well attonitus a large yellowish orange jet of water and light erupted from her wand she was flipped arse over heel backward but when she righted herself she saw her ploy had worked although she was unconscious the bubble head charm around fleur head remained to rinna relief she grasped the limp form of the girl and kicked swiftly upward rinna lungs were burning she had no time to waste she saw movement out of the corner of her eye and turned to see several merfolk flanking her as she kicked and pulled with her free arm now they show up she thought sourly she broke the surface sucking air deep into her chest the blonde was looking pale rinna needed to cancel the spell quickly finite incantatum it did not work she repeated it this time pointing her wand directly at fleur face and focusing her power on breaking the protection the french witch had woven into her charm the girl began spluttering and gasping as rinna kept her afloat fleur luminous eyes were watering when she turned to look at rinna my sister eet is my sister that as been taken she rasped coughing i must save er rinna schooled her voice to a calm impassive tone non the merpeople and i will retrieve her no harm will come to her i promise the girl seemed to calm a little rest now and i will help you to shore the blonde nodded once and took several deep breaths i can swim myself she said with quiet dignity fine rinna agreed but i will swim with you to be sure you get back without mishap rinna was speeding back to the dwelling of the merfolk and was nearly there when the young merman swam up to her and indicated she should once again turn around and follow him up ahead she saw many merfolk swimming and she mustered more speed to catch up she could just make out the shadow they were following but it looked oddly misshapen she moved closer her legs burning from the effort of kicking with the long fins it was harry pulling two people she stopped swimming stunned ron hair was a dull brown in the murky green lake light and the other body smaller had pale hair streaming back she took a moment to allow pride to swell inside her before pumping her legs in an effort to keep the group in sight she broke the surface and was deafened by the sound of the roaring crowd belatedly she cancelled the auditory enhancement spell and observed cedric and viktor on the shore with cho and hermione all wrapped in blankets percy weasley was splashing into the water to help his brother wade in and fleur was pulling away from her headmistress to rush to her sister everyone was safe she wanted to help harry out of the lake but found her limbs were quite leaden she was kneeling chest deep in the water her legs pointedly refusing to support her weight on the periphery of her vision she could see several concerned faces with wild green hair i alright she tried to say but it came out faintly she felt a tug on her legs and almost fell she turned to see her young man pulling the fins from her feet he grinned and handed them to her before tilting his head in a small bow thank you she rasped and the merfolk left her she shifted her eyes to the shore where dumbledore was crouched at the edge of the water in earnest screechy conversation with the merchieftainess however the sound of someone wading toward her arrested her attention take my hand arinna rinna looked up into the dark sardonic eyes of the potions professor he grasped her forearm and pulled her to her feet his hand on her elbow steadied her as she stumbled to dry land thanks rinna huffed out weakly she smiled i surprised you chanced it since i know your secret of how well you swim yes well he said dryly given that we were in less than waist high water i felt the risk was negligible he conjured a blanket and draped it carelessly about her shoulders thank you severus she pulled it tightly around her he seemed about to reply but she gestured abruptly for quiet dumbledore and the judges had just come out of the hurried consultation prompted by the merchieftainess report as ludo bagman magically enhanced voice announced the scores rinna did the mental math and realized that harry was tied for first place with cedric diggory she grinned damn she was proud of that kid she turned to her companion and her enthusiasm seemed to curdle under the regard of his sour face i suppose you are going to tell me i shouldntgive potter detention snape narrow eyed glare clearly indicated his disgruntlement rinna stared at him dumbly why on earth would you give him a detention she wondered for raiding my stores that why he snapped where else would he have obtained gillyweed you dontknow that for certain she conveniently ignored the fact that she had jumped to that conclusion herself he grasped her elbow again more tightly this time you ve gone soft she yanked her arm from his grip i have not gone soft she hissed hotly then she lowered her tone he lily son severus she saw him flinch ever so slightly i canthelp but care about he cut her off danger honing the edge of his words that boy is james potter son through and through he turned abruptly and left her standing on the pebbly beach the swirl of his black robes hampered somewhat by the damp hem it wasntuntil he d climbed the stone steps into the castle that harry realized his godmother was among the blanket clad people being shepherded by madam pomfrey she had cuts all over her arms and legs and a few on her face as fleur had he turned to ron what was ri i mean what was the g m doing in the water ron glanced back and shrugged i dunno they slowed to get closer to her but madam pomfrey was chivvying the lot of them into the hospital wing insisting on treatments for cuts and final doses of pepper up potion for all the medi witch rounded on the redhead as she passed through the infirmary doors why on earth are you still wet arinna rinna scowled well it didntseem sporting casting a drying charm when none of them she indicated the damp students with her chin are allowed to use magic to get comfortable pomfrey snorted as she made her way to a storage cabinet always did have a lion ish streak in you despite wearing the green she said then added softly so the boys had to strain to hear it you look exhausted did you even sleep last night here she handed rinna a stoppered bottle take this and go to your lover have him treat your cuts i giving you medical leave for the entire weekend what makes you think the older woman rolled her eyes oh please i dontunderstand why it such a secret but if you and your rock star paramour are not ready to go public well that your business and donttry to tell me it not serious rinna breath caught she knew she was being ridiculous madame pomfrey obviously had no idea who her real lover was but she still couldnthelp hearing donttry to tell me it not sirius pomfrey of course misinterpreted her small gasp her eyes cut to the ruby ring on rinna right hand held in place with a sticking charm while in the lake trinkets like that arentbestowed by a mere weekend fling rinna let out a rueful chuckle it a good thing you are not a gossip poppy she held up the bottle thank you and when i say medical leave for the entire weekend i mean starting now no locking yourself up in the dungeons for a few hours first poppy pomfrey stern look would have made even hagrid quail rinna glanced at her sharply you dontmiss a trick do you but madam pomfrey was already striding over to her other charges rinna looked around and saw harry and ron trying to act like they hadntheard a thing good show harry she said quietly i very proud of you what were you doing in the lake harry wondered and what was she talking about locking yourself in the dungeons i was playing lifeguard she replied listen i really should go before she comes back and makes me swallow some noxious tasting potion we ll talk sunday after dinner yeah and be sure to celebrate this weekend harry you deserve it dontworry i ll make sure he does ron assured her good man she smiled at them and left the infirmary harry and ron shuffled forward at madam pomfrey imperiously beckoning hand ron harry whispered did you notice she didntanswer my question about the dungeons blimey you re right harry gave a long suffering sigh typical he muttered as he accepted the mug of pepper up and submitted to the hogwarts medi witch ministrations to his cuts and bruises sirius and remus registered the subtle change in the wards almost simultaneously as remus pushed open the door to let his animagus friend in rinna home remus noted in surprise sirius gave a yap and cocked his head one ear lifting slightly to listen before tossing a doggy grin over his shoulder and bounding down the hallway remus chuckled sirius stepped quietly into the bedroom listening and testing the air with his canine enhanced senses he smelled shampoo and soap and heard the deep even breathing of slumber rinna was lying prone diagonally across the bed wrapped in a bath towel he wasntreally conscious of changing back to his human form until he felt the frown crease his face at the sight of the lacerations on her arms and the backs of her legs unease rippled through him what could have possibly gone wrong today that she d look like this is harry all right he perched on the edge of the bed and ran his fingers softly through her still damp hair until he felt her stir hey ruby he said softly what in the hell happened to you she opened the eye on the side of her face that wasntpressed into the pillow and mumbled grindylows is harry apprehension made him hoarse s okay she said into the pillow before groaning a little and rolling onto her back she smiled up at him he was brilliant blackie not only did he sirius held up his hand to forestall the tale harry not hurt he clarified no a few scratches that all he gently stroked her arm like this his expression indicated he thought the number of cuts on her arm did not fall into the category of a few she shook her head not as bad as all this he fine his fingers traced their way up to her chin and cheek are you all right his voice was deep with concern she reached up and fisted her hand in his shirt sirius found himself pulled firmly to her lips and he couldnthelp but grin as he returned the kiss i am now she whispered before tugging him to her mouth again fresh from a shower and ready for work remus entered the kitchen the sight of the forearms and the one crossed leg poking through the split in his titian haired friend dressing gown brought him up short frowning he studied the many scratches that had been daubed with a purple tincture grindylows by the looks of them he concluded how many were there how did you get away from them and how did this happen in the first place rinna put the sandwich she d been hungrily devouring down on her plate there were dozens i stunned them with the thunder strike spell which has an interesting effect underwater i must say and as for how this all came about i was just in the middle of telling sirius rinna returned to the beginning for remus benefit telling both men about the events of the last twenty four hours as remus made himself lunch remus shook his head and smiled first to get there but had to make sure all the hostages were safe he has a chivalrous streak in him our harry rinna snorted far more chivalrous than you boys were at that age to be sure sirius appeared affronted i beg to differ at his age i was a paragon of maturity and a complete gentleman rinna rolled her eyes merlin knickers how can you say that with a straight face blackie for your information at the age of fourteen you were pulling my braids and putting peruvian itching powder in my seat during potions and dontforget that he jinxed your quills to break while you were taking notes remus added helpfully actually it was tasmanian itching powder sirius corrected her with an impish grin he turned to remus just what are you smirking about moony the werewolf laughed trust dumbledore to remember that dare at the lake rinna harrumphed dumbledore remembers things when it is most convenient for him and least convenient for anyone else she said sourly but how in merlin name did harry figure out to use gillyweed sirius wondered and more to the point how did he get his hands on some rinna shrugged dunno gillyweed isntcovered until advanced herbology so sixth year at least she ignored the affectionately mocking of course you have every syllabus at hogwarts memorized look from her fianc as to how he got it well severus thinks harry broke into his storerooms although how he could have done without being caught invisibility cloak or no i not sure severus is always lurking about in the dungeons she did not miss sirius and remus glancing at each other nor the looks on their faces what she demanded sirius cocked an eyebrow at remus who nodded imperceptibly before turning to rinna harry has the marauder map he said simply he what rinna looked amazed sweet circe how did he get it i thought for sure filch would have burned it or destroyed it somehow especially after that botched attempt we made at retrieving it happily filch did not destroy it remus explained and as to how harry came to possess it well let just say that there are members of a new generation that uphold the spirit and custom of the marauders rinna eyes narrowed in thought then her mouth opened slightly in surprise fred and george remus nodded they nicked it from filch sirius joined remus in nodding rinna snorted well that took balls those two have plenty of that as you well know sirius pointed out and the brains to figure out how to activate it if harry had the map rinna mused then she shook her head i ll need to talk with him he cannot get careless severus snape has it in for that lad sirius growled that greasy haired git had better watch himself he trailed off when he saw rinna eyebrows lift what even now after all you know about that tosser are you still going to i have nothing to say sirius i have to work with the man so please do not put me in a position where i have to defend him i dontreally want to have to work that hard this weekend remus stifled a chuckle at this she glanced at him then back to her fianc besides i would much rather spend my time doing other things her lips slipped into a sly smile and her eyebrows twitched suggestively sirius snorted and appeared somewhat mollified as his eyes traced the line of her leg that peeped from between the edges of her dressing gown remus cleared his throat well look at the time he noted pointedly i d best leave for work he shifted his gaze from one to the other play nice now kids rinna snickered even as sirius replied mockingly yes mum rinna finished her sandwich and took her plate to the sink she turned and found herself facing her lover who wrapped his arms loosely around her i ve fed you and tended your wounds i think i deserve some of your undivided attention now he suggested what did you have in mind blackie she smiled his face softened grew serious honestly i miss just sitting with you talking holding hands he took one of her hands and kissed it then his ruffian grin started to take over his face again and if that leads to more well i think i d be okay with that she laughed and let him lead her into the living room so where were you lads she asked casually as she settled down next to him on the couch when i arrived she clarified ah we were out running running yeah he shrugged moony and i have been bitten by the fitness bug we try to go every morning before remus goes to work and i have to say it a damn good thing that whatever i do in my animagus form carries over to my human form he slapped his stomach twice rock solid or at least getting that way he grinned we are going to be the two most fit misfits in your life ruby you know i was surprised at how much attention of the feminine variety a bloke can garner when he is out running with his dog i swear every bird head turns as remus and i go by if he wasntso besotted with my chameleon cousin he could have his choice of fit health conscious women his voice trailed off as he noticed the odd look on her face what is it love the thought of dozens of people taking notice of sirius out in public morning after morning made her queasy she tried to keep her voice neutral although she wasntsure she kept out the note of disapproval entirely you go out every day well yeah his tone was matter of fact even though you are wanted by both magical and muggle censure was most definitely evident now sirius was exasperated hell rinna i only leave the house as snuffles no one knows i an animagus well except for a few whom i trust you make it sound as if i waltzing around with a glowing arrow above my head pointing and saying catch me peter knows she said quietly what peter knows you are an animagus his mouth hung open for a few seconds before he snapped it shut well wormtail is rinna shot up from the couch angry where sirius he where do you know she clenched her fists in frustration and began pacing he could be anywhere whispering secrets to anyone sirius crossed to where she stood her back to him and placed his hands on her shoulders you are forgetting that peter pettigrew cannot show himself without revealing the lie of his death he no threat rinna whirled do not underestimate him sirius you did before she dropped her head we all did she added sorrowfully sirius wrapped his arms around her and held her against his chest for several long moments what do you want from me rinna he murmured finally do you want me to promise to stay here all day and night like your pet owl in a gilded cage there was no rancor in his words she pulled away with a start and looked up into his face horrified to realize that that was exactly what she wanted i spent twelve years locked in a hole carved from the rock he explained softly and while the accommodations you offer are infinitely better than those of azkaban you are hardly ever here and remus is often gone too i start to climb the walls and what should feel like my home starts to resemble a prison her fingertips on his lips stopped him sirius watched a tear slip down her cheek and catch on the corner of her mouth before he brushed it away with his thumb more took its place i sorry her words seemed to catch in her throat i know it horribly selfish of me to want you to stay inside all the time even knowing that you spent so many years in that awful place i know it makes me appear that i only see you as some precious object to keep hidden in a treasure box her fingers were still on his mouth forestalling any reply he might make it just that the thought of losing you again she gave a shuddering breath and his arms tightened around her that thought terrifies me he buried his face in her neck if i could promise you that you would never lose me i would but you can t we both learned a long time ago that there are no guarantees in this life she brushed her cheek against his i would never try to curtail your freedom sirius as much as i d like to and as much as i want you to be safe i dontwant you to resent me or hate this place he kissed her i don t i love you and you ve made me feel like this is a home it just that he looked deeply into her eyes i get restless rinna and i dontknow how to change that her green gaze roamed across his face once again learning his features by heart before she returned to his eyes just promise me you ll be careful of course and remember what i said about peter dontget cocky or complacent blackie he raised his eyebrow me she smacked him lightly on the arm oh shut it you he took her hand and brought it to his lips you are wrong you know about there being no guarantees because here is one thing i can promise you that will never change i love you tears welled again merlin help me but i love you too sirius began backing up taking her with him until he felt the couch press against the backs of his legs shall i declare my love for you in a more he paused dramatically to cinch her hips up close to his and leer at her roguishly demonstrative manner she sniffled and smiled what happened to sitting talking and holding hands he sat down and pulled her onto his lap her knees on each side of his hips now we are sitting he ran his hands down her arms to her wrists before lifting them up and around his neck now we are holding hands she wove her hands into his hair and tilted his mouth up to hers as he kissed her deeply his fingertips skimmed the edges of her dressing gown off her shoulders and continued to trace her curves to her waist sirius wrapped his hands around each of her hips and hauled her close against him leaving no doubt in her mind as to how eager he was to prove his affection for her she released his mouth with a sigh and closed her eyes tilting her head back as his lips caressed the skin under her jaw down her neck to her d collet are we considering this talking then she whispered he lifted his head to grin at her and rinna mentally kicked herself for giving him a reason to remove his mouth from her breast dunno he said teasingly how well am i communicating my intentions his fingers picked up where his lips had left off brilliantly rinna gasped good he untied the knot at her waist and slipped his other hand into her dressing gown here is what i propose i make mad passionate love to you now and we talk later she shrugged out of the gown seized the hem of his tee shirt and pulled it over his head that the best plan you ve ever had marauder boy she growled his lips curved into a smirk against the soft skin of her breast as he resumed his ministrations bout time you recognized my genius ruby he chuckled when her only reply was to tug at the button of his trousers hermione wound her way through the quiet castle corridors to the library on early sunday mornings she could get quite a bit accomplished when hardly anyone else was around and still meet her friends for breakfast which was served later than on the other days of the week she d started this habit back in second year when she was taking extra classes using a time turner and she didntsee any reason to give it up especially since viktor started joining her viktor hermione had endured no small amount of teasing that she was the thing krum would miss most and she couldntpinpoint why exactly it bothered her so after all she d suffered far worse from her schoolmates and usually she was able to shake it off and ignore it by rote she took out her parchment and quill and ink then opened her transfiguration textbook only to stare at it unseeing it had been disconcerting to discover the depth of viktor affection for her in such an awkward manner and this had thrown her into confusion she d spent the past two months since the yule ball warding her heart telling herself not to fall hard for the charming bulgarian because really this had to be just a fling for him a flirtation to pass the time while here in britain she knew he used his relationship with her to deflect the many and often inappropriate offers from countless schoolgirls and she didntmind that she was happy to help make his stay as pleasant as possible and those hussies could be positively pesky and annoying but now she couldnttamp down the rogue thoughts that kept suggesting there could be something more to this thing with viktor not anymore certainly not since the second task and if she thought back there were signs she d chosen to ignore in the last couple of months as she d spent more and more time with the durmstrang champion they d discovered they had many similar interests and they could talk and laugh for hours and the kisses had gone from sweet and innocent to involving more tongue and teeth and hands she felt a blush creep over her face surely viktor hadntfallen for her the bookworm the was she really the person he would miss most the library door opened with a creak to allow in a tall slouching figure he found her eyes and gave her a discomfited smile before walking toward the table hermione heart started flipping erratically against her ribcage he asked me to go to bulgaria with him to meet his parents why would he do that unless he oh merlin herm own ninny he was there at the table hands on the back of a chair requesting permission to join her hermione swallowed nervously and nodded he took the chair next to her and sat turning to face her i haff been thinking viktor i she said at the same time they both laughed uncertainly he inclined his head you first no you she insisted viktor took a deep breath and let it out i haff been thinking i have not done good vork explaining to you how i feel about you oh she replied weakly as her heart invited the rest of her organs to join the dance his eyes dropped to her open book your reaction at the second task you vere surprised to find yourself as hostage for me she watched his hand nervously playing with her quill i i just didntexpect the one you d miss most is vat i saying mila he dropped the quill to take her hand instead i do not speak english vell i am sometimes how you say ashamed that i cannot find right vords to tell how i feel i think i vill sound to you like idiot i let pride keep me from being good napadnik boyfriend and you become embarrassed at second task b boyfriend viktor smiled ruefully you see you do not effen know i vant to be boyfriend he shook his head in irritation i am failure ven speaking to you she tugged his hand so he would look at her no no you re not a failure viktor it just that she blushed furiously this is all so new for me she whispered i ve never had a boyfriend before he looked at her askance neffer she nodded vy not she shrugged and looked away i not beautiful viktor made a noise of protest but she continued i a bit too swotty at his look of confusion she explained nerdy bookish it was her turn to fiddle with the quill i not very outgoing and i bossy and he gently pulled her chin around so he could see her face she gazed into his dark hazel eyes and shrugged again i i not the kind of girl that boys want for a girlfriend she was quite sure her voice hadntwavered that no hint of self pity had come through but viktor probed her with his eyes for a long time before he cupped her cheek herm own ninny english boys are idiots and blind he leaned forward and kissed her pressing his lips to one corner of her mouth then the other before covering it completely with his when he pulled away she was breathless and convinced her heart was staging a breakout right through her sternum viktor took hermione hand in his and played awkwardly with her fingers i haff confession i haff never had girlfriend before what is true ven i vas younger i haff school and i haff training for quidditch i haff no time for much else i made bulgarian team and vas effen more busy there is no time to meet nice girl and start relationship he blushed and continued to fiddle with her hand many girls many vomen they vant to meet me and give me attention i am like trophy to them they dontvant to know me they vant only the fame did i say this right hermione squeezed his fingers i understand what you are saying then i meet you mila and you ask me qvestions and you listen to my answers you treat me like normal boy and i say to myself here is girl who is kind here is girl who doesntjust vant to say she vat is vord bagged viktor krum she knew he wasntdeliberately trying to be vulgar but hermione blushed anyway he continued and now i haff made mess of it by not telling you that i vant to be boyfriend to you no she protested you haventmade a mess of things i was just surprised that all you see i didntwant to get too involved if this wasntanything serious for you her cheeks flamed even more i think i think i could fall head over heels for you if i let myself but viktor tenderly framed her face with his hands falling head over heels is good yes he smiled hopefully she smiled back it is if the other person is falling with you he leaned his forehead against hers his lips were very close and his voice husky when he replied herm own ninny i haff been falling since the yule ball me too her response was muffled by the touch of his lips to hers in a fiercely possessive yet incredibly tender kiss but viktor understood her perfectly rinna caught harry eye as the student body of hogwarts exited the great hall after dinner sunday night she gave an almost imperceptible jerk of her chin indicating he should meet her in her office he smiled acquiescence and leaned over to ron to let him know the change of plans go on mate i ll catch up to you later ron told him absently before turning back to seamus dean ernie macmillan and justin finch fletchley ron was once again regaling them with the story of what had happened under the lake and harry had to smile ron story was gradually changing with each retelling not that harry would begrudge his friend the limelight after all it took the heat off of harry for the time being he walked through the open door to the classroom and made his way to his godmother office hullo harry rinna looked up with a smile ron doesntneed you for crowd control does he harry grinned noticed that did you nah he fine you dontmind she asked casually me no harry shook his head emphatically i rather like having some breathing room for a change rinna gestured to a seat speaking of breathing there is something i need to speak to you about right away something in her tone made harry shift uncomfortably where did you get the gillyweed harry his mind kicked into high gear as he prepared to invent a plausible story er the reason i ask i not trying to get you or anyone else in trouble is that professor snape is under the impression that you took it from his stores she eyed him shrewdly i know you had the means with your cloak and the marauder map you know about the map she raised an eyebrow please with whom have i been all weekend harry looked abashed right he ran his hand through his hair nervously deciding that honesty was the best policy when dealing with his godmother at least in this instance i didnttake it rinna i was given it by a er a friend a friend i d rather not say who it a house elf you see and i dontwant him to get in trouble harry looked at her pleadingly she studied him intently all right i believe you and i didntcall you in here for a lecture on pilfering i wanted to warn you that professor snape believes you to be a thief and will be looking to make your life miserable so regardless of whatever advantage your cloak and map give you i recommend you lay low for a while she smiled at him to harry relief he was glad she wasntupset with him he wondered how she would have felt if he actually had taken the gillyweed from snape thanks he said pensively but i donthave any intention of taking anything from snape and besides i donthave the marauder map anymore rinna looked slightly alarmed you don t what happened to it oh i gave it to professor moody he kept it from falling into snape hands you see and then told me he wanted to borrow it said it d be dead useful moody huh her brow furrowed yes i suppose he would find it quite useful wouldnthe she tapped her lower lip thoughtfully before returning her gaze to harry at any rate watch yourself around the potions professor harry i will thanks for the warning rinna he cocked his head curiously how did snape professor snape harry how did professor snape know the gillyweed was gone rinna lips twitched because he went to fetch it out of the cupboard that morning for me i was to use the gillyweed during the triwizard task i had to resort to the bubble head charm instead harry ducked his head so he wouldntlaugh at the ironic expression on her face sorry rotten luck for you wasntit believe me dearest godson i did not begrudge you one slimy tendril of it she told him with a chuckle harry looked up and saw the twinkle of mischief in her eye and joined in her laughter sirius stood in the doorway surveying the bedroom before resting his eyes on the bed it had been three long days since she d been there the last time she d been on that bed she d been tangled in the sheets flushed from lovemaking and annoyed he wasnttaking her latest news well what do you mean three to four weeks i ll try to slip away for an evening or an afternoon she temporized bloody hell rinna it going to be six weeks before we can have harry here for easter hols and now you re telling me i canteven see you for almost a month what the hell am i supposed to do she sprang from the bed pulling the sheet with her and wrapping it around her body angrily i not exactly thrilled about this either sirius i get lonely too you know i miss being able to sleep with you wrapped around me or talking about harry or rowing about ridiculous things growing contrite he came up behind her and slipped his arms across her shoulders and chest dontforget making up and shagging after we row about ridiculous things he said softly she snorted typical man is that all you think about he could hear the smile in her voice taking the sting from her words well yes thinking of sex with you takes up quite a bit of my time when you re away as a matter of fact he turned her around i was denied that for too long and now that i ve had a taste of it again she sighed it bloody unfair she rested her forehead on his collarbone i ve been thinking what if i return to hogwarts with a new familiar i could talk to albus and have a big black mutt roaming the castle frightening the ickle firsties into thinking they ve seen the grim i dontthink dumbledore would go for that he gave a big sigh and even if he did you are forgetting about snivellus rinna head snapped up what about snape he knows i an illegal animagus he was standing there in the shack under harry invisibility cloak while moony and i explained everything to the kids she gritted her teeth damn he ll put it together right away and he d have no compunction about turning you in either sirius couldnthelp looking smug i hear that he didnttake it very well having the order of merlin for capturing me slip through his fingers at my untimely escape from hogwarts he might indeed be holding a grudge against me rinna exhaled in frustration why couldntyou two have settled your differences by having a pissing contest or whatnot like other normal teenaged boys did you just had to go and make an enemy of him instead he stiffened i wasntthe one who made the enemy he said fiercely before shutting his mouth at her piercing glance rinna did not know would not know ever about the words snape had spoken that made sirius angry past the point of caring that he was sending a boy straight to the jaws of a slavering werewolf it had been an immature reaction he knew but even now the memory ignited a furious irrational rage in him he raised a hand to her lips to stop her questions and schooled his face to his charming smile if i d known that the consequences were years later i would be looking at long weeks without sex or your smile i might have acted differently he saw her eyebrow quirk and knew he d deflected her for the moment her hand glided across his jaw and into his hair see it is all you think about canthelp it love he pointed out you re naked and in my arms it seemed the entire weekend had been spent arguing small things like how often the purple concoction needed to be applied to her cuts or whether the kitchen knives should be stored in the block sharp side up or sharp side down big spats over snape or sirius leaving the house as snuffles and why she needed to be on school premises to brew her potion for dumbledore arguments and sex it had been brilliant and sirius missed it terribly he missed her terribly he glanced down at the parchment in his hand harry reply to his inquiry of the next hogsmeade dates he had just over a week plenty of time to get there he walked to the living room made sure the letter for remus and the letter he would ask his friend to mail to his fianc e were clearly visible on the desk and shouldered the knapsack he d shrunk to a manageable size the time he d spent here at rinna house following years of deprivation in azkaban had taught him that he really needed companionship he needed his family harry and rinna were his family and if they couldntbe with him well then he d just have to go to them wouldnthe a large black dog wearing something that looked like one of those packs one would see on a service dog for a disabled person stepped out of the doggie door and took off trotting down the street never once stopping or looking back a n clears throat nervously noting a big empty echo are any of my readers still there or have you given up on me not that i d blame you merlin baggy y fronts real life has been sucking all my time away and kept me from my writing my wip stories feel like a forgotten mistress pets poor neglected stories but if you are still here please drop me a note telling me so and let me know what you thought of this chapter i feeling the need for forgiveness and absolution of my lack of posting sins attonitus stunned or thunderstruck in latin napadnik boyfriend in czech bulgarian is in cyrillic alphabet which i cantread czech is the closest i could get to bulgarian because i have some familiarity with it if anyone wants to tell me the bulgarian word for boyfriend i would love to be corrected a new definition of family chapter 3 reunion disclaimer well i dontown any of jk rowling characters big surprise i know any characters you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are my babies harry found himself standing in front of the fireplace of a cozy house his luggage ready rinna had a knapsack on her shoulder and a bakery box in her hand oh she snapped her fingers in annoyance sorry this ll just take a minute she apologized to harry rinna crossed the room to the telephone and dialed hullo dorrie it rinna thanks for the use of your car the keys are in the trunk so just blast your way in as usual oh thanks for the briefcase and phone too everything worked out talk to you soon luv she rang off and pressed the button on the answering machine beside the phone and spoke you have reached the office of upward bound uk we are sorry we cannot take your call at this time please leave your name number and message your call will be returned as soon as possible thank you she played the message back and nodded with satisfaction it good to cover our bases dontyou think they wontcheck up on me harry told her they couldntcare less what happens to me rinna looked at him appraisingly his tone was matter of fact not full of self pity as if that was all he ever expected from his family he deserves so much better she thought at least i knew mother loved me harry doesntknow what that feels like then slipping past her embattled defenses came the quisling thought and it is your fault so you ready she said brightly harry nodded he shoved his trunk and hedwig cage into the fireplace which at some point had started burning she handed him a canister and he took a handful of powder the burrow and with that the luggage disappeared in a roar of flames harry then rinna quickly followed rinna emerged from the fireplace into controlled chaos harry was being attacked by several red headed people and a girl with brown hair bemusedly she stood by and looked around the living room looks almost the same and suddenly she was in the fierce embrace of a forty ish plump woman welcome back luv molly whispered in her ear and gave her a peck on the cheek rinna staggered as molly weasley abruptly let her go only to be caught up by a tall man with thinning ginger hair good to see you old girl arthur said as he bussed her other cheek when arthur released his bear hug rinna opened her eyes to find many sets of eyes looking at her well those are the twins obviously they are turning out handsome and that must be ronald and the youngest one but where are percy charlie bill bellowed molly up the staircase get down here our company arrived more handsome boys clattered downstairs and crowded into the room harry was introduced to charlie and bill who were both on holiday from their work they shook hands with harry harry immediately liked both of them he thought bill was very cool with his ponytail and earring charlie was stocky and muscular from his work with dragons in romania and he had a friendly inviting face percy pompously extended his hand to harry good to see you again harry ron rolled his eyes and fred and george shoved percy aside and began taking turns pumping harry hand jolly good to see you old chap yes absolutely smashing to have you here you re a sight for sore eyes mate give us a kiss wontyou harry boys admonished arthur but he was smiling leave off the chatter died down as everyone became aware again of rinna presence in the room bill broke into a broad smile arinna dunlevy i have had a crush on you for over 15 years and seeing you now merely fans the flames of my humble adoration he strode over as he spoke and pulled her into a big hug rinna grinned as he released her and grabbed him by the shoulders well bill weasley i dare say you ve turned into quite a charmer oh no not a charmer he replied curse breaker give over charlie shouldered his brother out of the way and enfolded rinna in another rib crushing squeeze then he took her hand and bowed gallantly over it i must confess dear lady that when last i saw you all girls had cooties and you were no exception rinna laughed and charlie grinned cheekily at her however i will now amend my assessment of you you are magnificent ah here the charmer rinna smiled no wonder you do so well with the dragons charlie bill gave a guffaw and slapped charlie on the back molly and arthur joined charlie bill and rinna in laughter unaware for a moment that everyone else in the room was struck motionless in shock it feels good to laugh rinna realized and she was struck by a sharp pang of what homesickness this family is the closest thing to normalcy i ever had the thought plucked a chord deep in her buttressed heart i miss this she looked around percy had a puzzled frown on his face the rest of the weasley children and the brown haired girl had their mouths open in astonishment at this stranger their brothers were hugging and flirting with harry expression was torn between amusement and curiosity the moment was well awkward rinna cleared her throat i dontsuppose percy remembers me much she began he was five when i left the twins certainly won t this one fred and this is george molly pointed here is ron he the same age as harry of course and here our ginny rinna shook hands with each one feeling that hermione was being left out harry jumped in this is my friend er ron and my friend hermione granger as they shook hands hermione asked and how is it you know harry then come come it looks like we ll be doing a lot of talking let at least all sit down said arthur shooing everyone to take a seat in the living room bursting with curiosity ginny boldly asked rinna who are you this is arinna dunlevy dear molly replied let see your mum and i were second cousins right rinna dear rinna nodded so that makes you all third cousins the silence that followed was remarkable because it was probably the quietest moment heard in the burrow in years clearly i wasntmentioned to the younger ones rinna sighed mentally not that i blame molly and arthur really it was probably easier not to have to explain everything shrugging off the little spasm of hurt rinna picked up where molly left off your parents took me in after my mum died i lived here a few years before she faltered before i left england after another few awkward moments and curious glances around everyone began talking at once and the weasley home descended again into the typical pandemonium usually associated with it dinner had been set up in the shade of the backyard garden but not before a fine show of dueling tables by charlie and bill accompanied by mrs weasley fine cooking the dinnertime conversation had meandered from cauldron bottoms to the quidditch world cup to bill earring and hairstyle several times bill or charlie had tried to coax rinna into telling of her adventures abroad but to harry disappointment she had managed to be interrupted each time harry was sitting too far away to bring up any questions of his own as the garden began to darken charlie bill and arthur conjured candles to light the way through dessert which consisted of pastries rinna had brought harry sat back contentedly full and rather tired and listened to mr weasley discuss the morning plan of going to the wizarding museum of national history harry wasntsure he wanted to go until ron waxed enthusiastic about it hermione of course was beside herself with excitement percy excused himself to return to a report for work the twins applauded his departure and catcalled loudly after him blowing kisses and bellowing that they would miss him terribly molly scolded them and poured the tea without skipping a beat everyone leaned back and enjoyed the sounds of crickets chirping and gnomes giggling as hermione cat crookshanks chased them through the garden a pleasant breeze perfumed the air with the smell of honeysuckle and fresh grass ginny fell asleep harry found himself dozing a bit and finally arthur noted the time was late and sent the teenagers to bed with the warning they were getting up early harry got up and stretched and walked to rinna chair well goodnight she looked at him through heavy lidded eyes goodnight then harry and dontworry we ll talk again soon she watched him go into the house then heaved herself up from the chair molly shall i give you a hand with all this molly smiled appreciatively in response and accepted the offer when the clean up was done molly and rinna were finally alone in the kitchen rinna found her knapsack and pulled out an album bound in deep green leather she turned to molly her face flushed and her voice hushed almost reverent i brought this to show harry so he could see pictures of lily when she was young molly smiled i remember how you d spend evenings working on that album at this very table i think it was one of the only truly girly things you did rinna snorted and ran her hand over the smooth cover harry showed me an album he had today she remarked then more quietly it had pictures of all of us molly lily james me remus and and sirius molly remained silent but put her arm around the younger woman shoulders rinna voice had dropped to a whisper it nearly tore me apart to look at them molly squeezed her shoulders tightly molly had no illusions of knowing what rinna was going through she had not been privy to all of the circumstances that led up to the night of the potters deaths and rinna eventual departure from england certainly she had some ideas based on observations and outside information but rinna had stopped confiding in molly at the age of 19 when she had outgrown the need for mothering and long before any of those events the best that molly could ascertain tonight was that rinna had not healed from her wounds and the damage appeared to run deep rinna trusted molly this dear woman hadntpressed for explanations did not scold for too infrequent letters and had not demanded that rinna re establish communications when she had returned three years ago she had let rinna go and be her own woman no questions asked rinna respected that and admired the gumption it took to take on a 16 year old girl marred by trauma angst and rebellion she knew she d not been easy on the weasleys despite that they had always made her feel welcome and safe maybe this is the place in the presence of this woman in this house where i can open up this album and no shouted the protective part of her mind dontdo it it will hurt i know what i will see when i open this rinna said softly i prepared to see lily but i dontthink i can look at any pictures of him her voice quavered molly thought she understood perhaps a concealment charm over certain pictures only rinna eyes snapped to molly s that brilliant i could do that she took out her wand and began an incantation when she had finished she looked again at molly molly do you think i a terrible coward for what avoiding certain memories by concealing photographs she sighed i would never accuse you of cowardice arinna dunlevy but i am concerned that you seem to push away all your feelings what do you mean rinna frowned i spent the entire evening watching you sidestep any conversations that might bring up memories dodge questions about your time abroad avoid harry altogether it was an impressive display i rather thought i was at a quidditch match watching you evade bludgers ouch rinna groaned and sat down heavily in a chair leaning forward until her forehead lightly smacked the table it was a move so reminiscent of the teenaged rinna that molly couldnthelp but smile all right came her voice muffled by the table let me have it molly was slightly taken aback have what rinna turned her head on the table so one eye was looking at molly and smiled a bit ruefully the infamous molly weasley lecture that i probably deserve many many times over merlin knows i ve managed to avoid it for 13 years now i about due dontyou think well molly tutted busying herself with wiping her hands on her apron and casting a sly sideways glance at the young witch before sitting down next to her all right then but remember dearie you asked for it rinna huffed out a little laugh as molly grasped her hand affectionately rinna dear you cantjust stop yourself from feeling it no good besides if you dontfeel how do you know you are alive rinna sat up and gently squeezed molly hand before pulling her own away to be honest molly i dontthink i am alive i mean i swear sometimes i feel like a walking corpse empty why would you even want to continue this way because it is safe rinna combed her fingers through her hair in frustration i safe from feeling safe from emotions do you know what happens when i allow myself to feel anything i start to feel the guilt and when i feel the guilt then i start to feel the pain and i so afraid of the pain molly rinna dropped her head in her hands it really had been a long and tiring day she had to be insane to be having this conversation now after all the struggles she d had with her emotions this day but the dam was breached and the words continued to spill i afraid that i wontbe able to stand the pain and i ll end up back in st mungo s like before molly took the younger woman in her arms rinna luv you need to let it out you need to cry scream something it is not healthy to keep it all locked away inside you like this all these years rinna pulled back no i fine i dontneed to cry i have everything under control i will not be weak she said fiercely dear girl crying isnta sign of weakness it a sign that you are human molly watched as rinna silently disengaged from the conversation her body language spoke volumes she gotten quite skilled at that i guess the lecture is over molly reached over and squeezed her hands i dare say i ve scared you off from an invitation for dinner again tomorrow what oh no i mean no you didntscare me off i did promise harry i d tell him more about his mum rinna looked at the abandoned album can i leave this here for harry to look through if he wants seeing molly nod she added it would be easier if i didnthave to look at the pictures with him at least not yet you are a coward rinna girl what time tomorrow then oh anytime in the afternoon molly stood up and opened her arms rinna looked up into her face then stood reaching in and accepting the older woman embrace thank you molly for everything she whispered any time luv any time hermione smelled a mystery and was determined to solve it with harry and ron playing watson to her holmes lounging in their pajamas the three were engaged in deep discussion in the room harry and ron were sharing so who is she harry she asked werentyou listening mione teased ron i surprised you didntdig out some parchment and start taking notes down there i didntneed to she smirked as she pulled out a rather impressive looking quill and blank parchment i saved my allowance for this she touched the quill with her wand and it began writing a transcript of all the conversations she had heard that evening it a transcription quill now i donthave to worry about gaps in my notes in class i can check them against this you have this quill but you re still going to take notes you re completely mental you know ron rolled his eyes at her hermione stuck out her tongue at him the transcription quill finished its work with a flourish and settled on the parchment it nice and fast hermione noted with satisfaction she picked up the parchment and began skimming it harry is being awfully quiet she looked up at him reading puzzlement and worry on his face harry are you all right she frowned with concern i just thinking about your question mione he said thoughtfully i met her only 12 hours ago and she said she had been best friends with your mum that right he clarified ron asked how do y know it true harry flashed a grateful look at ron as the day had worn on he d felt more and more like a cad for questioning rinna integrity but here was ron questioning it too harry didntfeel so bad about it now she showed me a picture here let me get it harry found his discarded jeans and pulled the picture from his pocket he handed it to ron hermione crowded in to get a better look blimey said ron they look like sisters hermione nodded they certainly look like very good friends i found a picture of her in my album too the one hagrid gave me let see it the other two said in unison harry went to his trunk and pulled out his album it changed to normal size that wicked admired ron how d you get it to do that i didn t rinna charmed my trunk somehow it was weird though i never saw her use a wand she never even went to my room hermione meditated on this new information i wonder how powerful a witch or wizard has to be in order to work magic on an object they canteven see or have never seen she mused harry had flipped to the page with the dancing he pointed to the edge of the picture where professor lupin had just dipped the red dressed rinna they watched the picture cycle through a few times i wonder if she and professor lupin were going out said hermione why is it that girls always want to find some sort of romantic relationship in everything ron asked the ceiling why is it boys can be thick as posts sometimes hermione also consulted the all knowing ceiling why cantwe stick to the topic at hand harry rolled his eyes at his two friends right sorry said hermione the topic is arinna and lily were best friends that all we know about her they were quiet for a few moments well it rather odd that you ve never heard of her or met her before dontyou think hermione asked but i d never heard of sirius either until last year no one wanted to tell me about him because hermione finished his thought because they didntwant you to know he betrayed your parents so do you think she did something something no one wants to tell you about because it is so awful ron asked hermione clicked her tongue at him honestly ron like your parents would let her in their house if she had done something awful another thought struck her she said your folks took her in and she lived here a few years why is it they never told you younger kids about her and for that matter why didntthey tell me about her harry chimed in he started to get a little upset about that mr and mrs weasley of all people should know how much he wanted to learn more about his parents but they did not tell him of the existence of lily best friend they had to have known that arinna and lily were chums all right let look at this logically hermione stated is there any other way for mione to look at it ron stage whispered attempting to lighten the mood i heard that you know she began jotting notes she claims to be your mum best friend she also happens to be related to ron but neither of you have heard of her before today she mentioned that when she had left england percy was five he eighteen now right mrs weasley said she had been back almost three years so that means she had been gone for almost 10 years what was she doing all that time ron wondered hey maybe everyone thought she was dead that why no one spoke about her but then why wasntharry told about her when she returned to england hang on she came back here the same year we started going to hogwarts harry pointed out so what the connection asked ron harry raked his hands through his hair in frustration i dontknow we need more information he was tired cranky and more than a little put out that vital information was being kept from him again mr and mrs weasley knew this woman professor dumbledore apparently knew her even professor lupin judging from the way he held her when they danced knew her i respect each of these people and i think they want the best for me why would they wait harry snapped his fingers sirius hermione and ron looked at him perplexed dontyou see he said excitedly if my mum and dad knew her and professor lupin knew her then sirius must have known her too she told me she knew all the marauders he commandeered hermione bag searching for blank parchment and a quill i ll owl him and ask him for information harry hermione voice was gentle and worried he might not be able to tell you much during the time in question he was in azkaban her heart stung as she watched harry excitement deflate like a popped balloon but it would be worth asking him about it she added helpfully yeah it would be he resumed his writing at least he was taking action and it did make him feel better to be writing to his godfather maybe someday when circumstances are better i could live with sirius harry let himself indulge in this newest fantasy for a few brief delightful minutes at the end of the term harry wish had almost come true but sirius had had to go on the lam again and that squelched any hope of having a new family at least for this summer he finished his note the trio crept down the stairs to the living room where three owls were quietly roosting after dispatching hedwig with an admonition to keep sirius whereabouts secret harry turned and glanced into the kitchen sitting invitingly on the table was a rather large book a new definition of family chapter 4 retrospection disclaimer well i still dontown any of jk rowling characters not for lack of desire mind you it just that she got to them first any characters spells or places you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my fertile imagination harry didntknow how long he had sat at the kitchen table turning pages eyes devouring pictures of his mother he ignored the people she was posed with ignored the elegant writing under or near the photos providing details of the events the photos portrayed all he wanted to see was his mum and of course his dad because later on in the album james was featured too harry was too tired to do more than look tonight he promised himself that tomorrow he d read the stories about his parents that rinna had captured in her refined handwriting he was coming to the last few pages when his eyes were arrested by a large picture of a red headed woman holding a baby whose dark hair stuck out in all directions the woman was clearly entranced by the infant in her arms cooing and laughing and reverently touching the little hands and feet the woman turned as if answering a remark from the invisible photographer and looked harry in the face she was not his mother a sudden realization swept over harry his spine prickling with the implications could she be and he wished that he had allowed ron and hermione talk him into going upstairs instead of insisting he sit at the table and look through the album tonight because he knew knew without a doubt that he would not be sleeping now his eyes were drawn to a letter on the facing page written in rinna hand on a scrappy piece of parchment whereas he had ignored all of the other captions and notes he felt compelled to read this one sweet baby harry you are less than 15 minutes old and i finally get to hold you in my arms i am immediately smitten and i start talking to you and you look at me so intently i am sure you understand completely all that i am saying your mum insists that i write down everything i have said to you and she eventually wrenches you away from me and your dad hands me a scrap of parchment so i ve decided to write you this letter hello precious one you are the most amazing little creature i ve ever seen you are very loved do you realize that i will always love you and i promise you that anytime you need your auntie rinna for whatever reason i will be there for you i will love you like you are my own little boy and some day you will be the big brother to my children no matter what you will always have a special place in my heart may you grow to be a man of integrity and wisdom and grace like your dear mum and dad my fervent wish for you is that you have as dear friends as your parents are to me precious things are very few in this world and deep friendship is a priceless gift you are so tiny so precious no one else has ever put my heart in motion this way like it was missing a beat until you were put in my arms how can i fall head over heels over someone i just met i never believed in love at first sight until this moment harry james potter i wonder if you ll ever realize how much you already have me wrapped around your tiny little finger i will always be your loving godmother arinna dunlevy harry sucked in his breath sharply and fell back against the chair stunned it wasntthe fact that rinna was his godmother that surprised him that actually made sense now that he thought about it she had been his mum best friend just as sirius had been his dad s he was momentarily puzzled by her lack of declaring herself to him but the thought was quickly pushed aside what did leave him astounded was the sheer mushiness of the letter harry had never read a note like that directed at him before the words swam before his eyes precious one place in my heart love at first sight you are very loved no one had ever told him he was loved like this sure he knew that hermione loved him and ron he knew the weasleys were very fond of him yet none of that kind of love felt like the love he read on this page he d be hard pressed to describe just what kind of love it was but he knew it was different and it was lacking in his life it was like a mother love that had been poured into that parchment he had difficulty wrapping his head around it harry realized just how inadequate the word love really was it was used to describe so many different feelings he vaguely remembered hermione telling him that there were five different words for love in greek he sat somewhat astonished for quite some time eventually he realized he also had difficulty with the incongruence of the rinna in the picture and letter and the rinna he had met today not that he expected that she should have fallen all over him gushing and whatnot but she was just so well detached aloof off putting he could not imagine this woman writing the letter he just read the lateness of the hour well after midnight and the excitement of the day yesterday actually started to overtake the conundrum that was niggling at his mind he laid his head on the table for a moment to collect his thoughts and was stealthily overtaken by the black depths of sleep molly yawned her way down to the kitchen to start on breakfast and pack the picnic lunch for the culmination of this morning outing she was startled to find harry face down on the table the album rinna had left was open by his head did she place an enticement on that scrapbook molly shook her head at the thought no rinna wouldnthave done that i hope harry was probably feeling peckish in the night and found it on his midnight raid of the pantry molly moved closer to harry and the page he had been looking at commanded her attention the picture of rinna and harry was a poignant memento of a relationship that should have happened she glanced to the letter on the facing page and read it tears springing to her eyes rinna had been all atwitter at the prospect of being harry godmother often joking about making all her mothering mistakes on him so her children would turn out perfect she had had a knack with children the boys had all adored her it was such a shame molly paused to mourn for the surrogate grandchildren she had dreamed would come from rinna but were not meant to be wiping her eyes on the sleeve of her dressing gown she reached down and gently shook harry shoulder all right harry he jerked awake and looked around disoriented you have an odd taste in pillows dearie molly teased harry rubbed the red spot on the bridge of his nose where his glasses had pressed sorry he muttered must ve fallen asleep no doubt you ll have a crick in your neck from sleeping like that why dontyou go up and take first crack at a nice hot shower after you re dressed you might even have a chance at forty winks before breakfast she ruffled his hair and shooed him with her hands harry reached for the album then hesitated go on and take it up with you molly suggested she brought it for you to look at harry nodded and took the album and stifling a yawn groggily staggered out of the kitchen breakfast was mayhem as usual george and fred had charmed the griddle to rather forcefully hurl the finished flapjacks onto each person plate it would have been a useful spell to be sure had the flapjacks been charmed to dodge obstacles but as it was most everyone ended up momentarily wearing his or her breakfast hermione leaned forward conspiratorially to harry using molly tirade against the twins for cover and whispered did you find out anything useful ron pricked up his ears yeah mate you didnteven make it to bed must have been pretty interesting you didntgo to bed last night at all hermione hissed reprovingly harry that was very foolish now you will be grumpy and no fun at all ron protested mione that not fair if we were at hogwarts and harry had pulled an all nighter studying you d be fawning all over him right now and cooing about his dedication to his academic pursuits first of all you prat i do not coo and secondly actually i did fall asleep on the table harry interrupted their squabble with a grin then he dropped his voice lower but i did find out something what are you three up to came the sharp voice of molly weasley er nothing mum ron said hastily i was telling them about the wing at the museum that devoted entirely to quidditch harry looked at ron with interest and raised his eyebrows inquiringly ron nodded hermione let out a sigh that indicated she was suffering under the boys obsession for the game charlie jumped into the conversation with enthusiasm it really is a brilliant exhibit harry i could spend hours in that section as you have proven many times in the past molly said tartly now hop to everyone the morning is wasting despite being bone tired harry enjoyed the outing to the wizarding museum of national history particularly when they found the section that was dedicated to the history of quidditch harry ron ginny fred george and charlie grinned like hippogriffs in a meat locker and never even realized they had been abandoned until the rest of the group came back to round them up for lunch in the shade of a tree in the plaza next to the museum the trio munched on their picnic lunches what did you find out harry the suspense was killing me all morning asked ron around bites from his sandwich oh please hermione rolled her eyes i ll wager you forgot all about it while you were in the quidditch section both of you the boys looked at each other sheepishly hermione was on the mark as usual i found out that harry was not unappreciative of the effect a good dramatic pause could have a brown head and a red head moved closer to the brunet she my godmother he finished simply of course ron snapped his fingers that makes sense sirius was your dad best mate and he is your godfather hermione finished the thought and arinna was your mum best friend so she your godmother the kids were silent for a moment but what doesntmake sense said ron with a frown is why she didnttake you after you know hermione lips made a little moue of frustration harry grimaced and ran his hands through his dark hair that what i d like to know he grumbled the afternoon proved to be another warm one and the teens sought refuge on the porch playing various wizarding card games george and fred taught them the latest craze in wizards poker called transylvania hold em the combination of heat and lack of sleep caught up with harry and he opted to nap on the hammock seeing as he was momentarily safe from the twins pranks they were busy raking in their winnings finally the game was called as fred and george had taken every last piece of honeydukes candy that ron and hermione owned harry woke up declined a game of exploding snap with hermione and ron and fetched the photo album instead harry sat under a tree in the back yard back against the thick trunk album on his lap he was reading the captions and bits of journaling that accompanied the pictures rinna apparently possessed a sly wit even as a youngster and many funny or embarrassing anecdotes were documented harry especially enjoyed the bits of information he got about his parents curious i see mum dad rinna professor lupin and even pettigrew but where are pictures of hullo harry a glass of lemonade appeared before harry eyes as rinna handed it to him then sat down next to him with her glass and a bowl of pretzels found the album then she offered the bowl to him it was a bit cowardly of me i know harry turned a quizzical look to her to just leave it not look through it with you she explained actually harry was glad to have been able to look through it alone he d liked having those private moments with his parents but he was irritated that she had not been forthright with him yesterday why didntshe just tell me she was my godmother so he decided to take a little dig that was very un gryffindor like of you he admonished a memory came to rinna suddenly and clearly as the day it happened a memory of turning to four teenaged boys pausing and saying how very gryffindor like of you she shook her head to clear the vision where had that come from after all these years she smiled regretfully at him yes i suppose you could say that she sighed and leaned against the tree trunk closing her eyes and gathering her courage around her like a cloak all right harry m lad bring it on i ready for this i think harry heaved a frustrated sigh when once again explanations did not come tumbling from her lips not that he was surprised however he was shrewd enough to realize that he would likely lose in a game of silent waiting to see who would crack first after all she was reluctant to give up any information and he was eager to extract it so he cast her a sideways glance and said rather petulantly why didntyou tell me that i your godmother she huffed out a long breath blowing the hair off her forehead i certainly dontdeserve that title now do i she lifted her head opened her eyes and looked at harry her face impassive i suppose that i didntwant to disappoint you having to tell you that you had yet another godparent who had failed to come through for you she pulled the album out of harry grasp and flipped to the page with the letter to the infant harry she handed it back to him and pointed to the second paragraph of her letter harry re read it harry looked up at her when she whispered i promise you that anytime you need your auntie rinna for whatever reason i will be there for you her voice was choked with regret bitterness and pain i wasntthere when you needed me harry she was unaware of crushing a pretzel to powder in her hands it tears me apart to look at you and have to admit that i was unable to keep my promise to you why he whispered what happened now her voice rose a little in agitation that night happened she said bitterly your parents were killed you somehow survived and voldemort power was somehow negated hagrid took you away on dumbledore orders but where were you why didntyou take me in his voice was threaded with anger and despair rinna threw her head back against the tree connecting with a little thump and squeezing her eyes shut against the memories i never made it to godric hollow harry at the time the dark lord curse was recoiling off of you i was uh his reluctant guest in some dungeon of his bound by curses and spells oh what more could he say he digested this startling information he jerked up his head in surprise when she continued her voice once again stoic you apparently saved my life all of the magical bonds and compulsions i was under disappeared in that moment of defeat i was found in the gardens of the manor where i was being held i was crawling in an attempt to get to all of you under some delusion that i could somehow stop what had happened harry was horrified by the pictures her words conjured in his mind there was a long pause by the time i had sufficiently recovered and learned that you were still alive you had already been placed with your aunt family something in harry snapped all my life i have been abandoned by every adult who was supposed to have cared for me no one was there for me my parents died my godfather gets sent to prison my mum own family treat me like scum and my godmother he turned to face her eyes flashing and jaw set and that it harry spat furiously you just gave up and left me with them what happened to that special place in your heart that i had rinna looked at him dumbstruck eyes wide why didntyou fight for me and just as suddenly the storm was over harry slumped his head into his hands and said quietly of course i know why sirius was my legal guardian not you rinna blinked and took a deep breath she had been prepared for something such as this or so she thought preparation did not stop his words from tearing at her heart and worse clawing at memories it would be so easy to just let it end here let him think a simple legality prevented me from taking him in unfortunately harry outburst had awoken in rinna one of her gifts that had become a casualty of her ruthless campaign to keep memories and pain away her keen sense of empathy she knew what it felt like to have a parent die she knew the pain of abuse by ones you were supposed to trust for protection she understood the sense of abandonment that harry must be feeling i cantleave it like this it would be a lie harry needed to understand why she hadntfought for him there is no getting around it then rinna you need to belt up and tell him about st mungo s a n thanks for reading i hope you enjoyed it i really would like to hear your thoughts about this chapter or the story in general so go to the go button and leave a review i d be thrilled to hear from you a note about the album i am a scrapbooker it is one of my hobbies unfortunately i dontget much time to do it these days especially since i am writing so if i cantdo my hobby i will just write about it and live vicariously through rinna album right now if you are a scrapbooker you can probably imagine what her album might look like with journaling and ephemera and embellishments if you are not a scrapbooker whatever you do do not get started doing it it is addictive expensive and leads to obsessive behavior you have been warned 7 a new definition of family chapter 5 explanations and broomsticks disclaimer well i still dontown any of jk rowling characters not for lack of desire mind you it just that she got to them first any characters spells broomsticks or places you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my fertile imagination rinna shifted her position uncomfortably no there was no legal restriction preventing me from taking you if anything was to happen to sirius i was next to be your legal guardian she saw harry open his mouth in reply and interjected harry please listen to me i need you to understand something that whatever it was in her voice that compelled him to listen to her was back he nodded you must believe me that if it had been in my power to do so i would have found you and wrenched you away from the dursleys dumbledore magic be damned she said with ferocity unfortunately her eyes became unfocused as her words drifted to a stop she shook her head and started again you see harry i was devastated that i hadntbeen able to stop what had happened to your parents that i couldntwarn them or anything if i had just made a different choice if i had her breath hitched she filled her lungs then blew the air out her mouth and continued my mind and body were uh i was i was just hanging by a thread to my sanity at that point when they found me merlin this was arduous difficult or no there was no turning back now then when i learned about what happened with with with sirius and peter when i was told that sirius was a traitor and a murderer and was being sent to azkaban again harry opened his mouth but she held up her hand to forestall him well i just slipped over the edge of reason i was taken to st mungo s that is st mungo hospital for magical maladies and injuries have you heard of it harry nodded appalled i was there almost three months memories hazy and unfocused encroached on her concentration remus was he really there every day his soothing voice reading molly with her new daughter and year old son in a pram how could she bear to bring them to such a place dumbledore voice soft and compelling entreating me to climb out from my dark well of despair remus holding my hand telling me how much he needed his only remaining friend she exerted her will to regain her focus i recovered eventually but there were questions as to my uh my competence to be your to take you on fears of my having a relapse i suppose wouldntbe good to place a tyke with his barmy godmother would it she laughed mirthlessly harry just gaped at her i knew that you were safe in petunia house knew the magic that was used to protect you you would be out of harm way and far more secure there than with me at that point i left england a few months after assured in the knowledge that you were safe but cognizant that i had utterly failed you she leaned back against the tree trunk and closed her eyes for the moment completely spent harry was quiet for a long time he felt a tightness in his throat that made speech impossible if he had been asked to describe what he was feeling right now he would have said it was like he had been so close to grasping the snitch almost had it in his hands and at the last moment nothing nothing but air his face reflected anger and grief once again he d learned how close he had been to having a happy childhood only to have it cruelly snatched away he was angry with rinna angry with her for being weak for succumbing to madness when she should have been taking care of him and yet another part of his mind realized that he was being unfair to her she was tortured you selfish prat and she lost her best friend and thought sirius was a murderous betrayer his eyes moved down to the album on his lap of course that why there are no pictures of sirius she thought he was a traitor and removed them but she wrong i need to tell her that sirius was set up harry glanced at her not sure if now was the time but desperately wanting her to know that sirius was innocent sirius black did not betray my parents she started and opened her eyes this was not the response she had expected from him what i said sirius black did not betray my parents and he didntmurder all those people or peter pettigrew we found out the truth last month at hogwart s do you want me to tell you what happened oh she whispered i already know that harry had not anticipated this you do how could you he wondered remus lupin told me she closed her eyes again seizing the opportunity to replace the memories that were currently performing an obscene dance in her head she let her mind wander to that day last month when remus had come to her house remus she was surprised to see him and took in the damage to his face and disheveled appearance you look like shit what the hell happened to you hello remus so nice to see you after almost six months do come in wontyou you devilishly handsome man he retorted sarcastically rinna had the grace to blush sorry but you woke me up i feeling a bit waspish at the moment she grabbed his hand and pulled him inside come in come in i ll put the kettle on it after 10 30 in the morning how is it possible that you are just waking up are you hung over she made a face at him why arentyou at hogwarts term not over yet she cast a suspicious glance at the wounds on his face he sat at her kitchen table and shrugged i quit this took rinna by surprise what the short version is word got out that i am a werewolf i resigned so that dumbledore would not have to suffer the process of sacking me rinna did a quick calculation in her head the full moon was just past did you not have your potion she asked carefully unfortunately no was anyone hurt besides you i mean remus thought of sirius yes she looked up sharply any students thank god no but it was close do you want to talk about it rinna watched as several emotions played across remus face there was more to the story she could tell but he was reluctant to open up yet time to graciously offer a way out of the conversation she held up a bottle of fire whiskey or should we just get drunk he raised his eyebrows is that such a good idea what with you being hung over ouch changing the subject with a pointed personal remark nice one remus she recognized the avoidance maneuver she was after all a master of those herself what makes you think i am hung over well your incredibly witty and charming personality improves by leaps and bounds when you are after your endearing greeting at your door i just naturally assumed bite me remy he grinned and appreciated her use of her old childhood comeback when he would nag at her too much he sealed the ritual with the expected witty retort not the best thing to suggest to a werewolf luv he looked her up and down besides you re still in the clothes you wore out last night unless you are now wearing sequined halter tops and skin tight trousers to bed instead of these cute flannel boxer shorts and t shirts you used to favor he smirked at her she looked down damn i meant to change into those must have slipped my mind i worried about you rinna remus she said exasperatedly i fine i am not hung over i had to work late double shift you know he looked at his friend somberly she is absolutely brilliant at potions and she is wasting her talent mixing alcoholic concoctions as a bartender he took in her face with the dark circles under her eyes accentuated by smeared makeup and the same taut wariness she had worn since hearing about sirius escape from azkaban those many months before well you look terrible her eyes snapped in anger hello rinna so nice to see you after these past six months i ve popped in to insult you and accuse you of being a lush you incredibly short tempered shrew remus was taken aback i sorry rinna it none of my business he said stiffly she felt the anger drain out of her no i sorry of course it your business you re my oldest friend i lucky to have someone who cares about me so much she put her hand on his arm will you forgive me for being such a bitch he took her hand and in a gallant gesture he kissed it i wouldnthave you any other way he said sincerely she pulled her hand away and slapped him lightly on his arm insufferable git he grinned at her as she retrieved the tea kettle and poured him some tea she settled in her seat at the table and looked at him over the rim of the teacup the offer still stands you know talking about it or getting drunk with me either one or both remus sighed actually i do need to talk to you you need to hear the details and i need to talk to you about sirius the teacup slid from her hand and sloshed hot tea everywhere her eyes were wide oh no remus she whispered donttell me the dementors caught him remus studied her for a moment looks like you care about what happens to him more than you like to let on rinna dear he cleared his throat no he still on the run but new details about about that night have been revealed there are things you need to know she closed her eyes she did not want to talk about that night nor sirius black she heard her refrigerator door open and was startled to see remus rummaging through it he pulled out a few items and turned to her he knew she wore sexy outfits to work she told him she got more tips that way and damn she sure did them justice he needed to concentrate needed no distractions when he told her his news and he couldntjust tell her she was distracting him with all that creamy white skin exposed and the pants hugging her every curve he needed a diversion look why dontyou go get cleaned up i ll cook us some breakfast he glanced at the clock er brunch and then we ll talk this is very bad if remus is stalling like this then she heard his stomach rumble or he could just be starving right then i ll just go get cleaned up remus looked up as he heard her bare feet pad into the kitchen she was fresh faced with her cropped hair slightly damp and dressed in jeans and a short sleeved blouse unfortunately she did not look one bit less attractive but at least her cleavage wasntso blatantly exposed he shook his head at these thoughts and set a beautifully prepared omelet in front of her she took a bite and moaned appreciatively you know remy that a man who cooks like you is every woman fantasy is that so he snorted in amusement you ll notice all the women lined up and beating at the door to get to me i know someone who is very interested in getting to you she grinned conspiratorially he looked at her sharply as his heart did a nervous flip flop who could you possibly know who would know me and he gulped the only two women she could realistically be referring to were rinna or you couldnteven remotely be hinting that your former roommate his voice trailed off in disbelief she chuckled at his discomfiture oh but i most certainly am she talks about you ad nauseum she smirked when she saw him wiggle uncomfortably in his chair and she already knows all about the werewolf thing she seems to have no problem with that rinna was thoroughly enjoying making remus squirm she confessed to me she has had a crush on you since the tender age of four when sirius brought you and james to his cousin for a visit her voice came to a halt and she had a troubled look on her face mentioning sirius name had broken the spell of the teasing camaraderie and reminded them both of the reason for remus visit remus reached out and took her hand and the two friends moved to the couch remus proceeded to relate the entire story of what happened at hogwarts a few nights before he hoped that some of the details might bring rinna some peace but knowing her as he did he suspected that they might just give her more things to feel guilty about instead when he was done he was more than concerned about the ashen look on her face she sat there immobile with her eyes closed and shoulders slumped he wished that just once she would let him take her in his arms and she would cry because all this keeping everything in that she did so effectively was slowly eroding her spirit she was one of his old school friends he loved her dearly and frustratingly it seemed there was nothing he could do to help her except this he thought as he got up and went to the kitchen he came back with the bottle of fire whiskey and two glasses she lifted her head when she heard the clink of the glasses on the coffee table shall we get drunk now he suggested as he poured well if you already heard it from professor lupin i guess i dontneed to rinna sprang back to the present it occurred to her that if harry was busy talking he would be less likely to ask more questions of her surely information that she had already known for a month would not be that painful to hear actually i would like to hear it from your viewpoint if you dontmind harry was surprised uh okay he looked up to the house and saw that hermione and ron were still playing some kind of game on the porch do you mind if ron and hermione come over to help fill in the story the situation had improved again if harry friends joined them then chances were good harry would not be asking anymore painfully probing questions of her this evening although rinna had no doubt that ron and hermione would know every detail of her and harry conversation under the tree by the end of the night all right i dontmind but i think we need to make ourselves more comfortable i dontknow about you but my bum feels completely numb from sitting on the ground harry managed a half hearted laugh and then waved his two friends over meanwhile rinna pulled out her wand and conjured four comfortable lounge chairs two more glasses of lemonade and refilled hers and harry s rinna actually found herself enjoying the retelling of the story in a way watching the three kids interact hearing the story interwoven as it jumped between narrations learning minute details that remus had not or could not provide was most interesting it was obvious the friendship between the trio was tight the three practically worked together like a collective consciousness at points it made her miss lily keenly and then my leg broke in like fifteen places ron was saying oh please hermione rolled her eyes why is it that each time you tell this part your fractures multiply exponentially i was hurt very badly ron gritted through his teeth at her harry interjected on ron behalf yeah mione it took madame pomfrey several hours to sew ron leg back on hey ron rounded on harry dontyou start on me too rinna chuckle was interrupted by a whoof as crookshanks chose that moment to jump on ron stomach gerroff he grumbled as he waved the cat off with his hands crookshanks walked with great dignity to rinna chaise and tromped partway up her legs she extended her hand and he rubbed the side of his face against her fingers she trailed her fingers down his back and he meowed at her pleasantly hrrr reow rinna trilled back at him blimey cried ron donttell me you can talk to cats no ron that was just the fine art of imitation rinna grinned ooooh ouch she cried as crookshanks began to knead his claws on her thigh purring loudly hermione apologized profusely and tried to pull crookshanks off rinna leg but he dug in undeterred it all right hermione rinna reassured her as she waved her wand and a pillow appeared beneath crookshanks paws he didnteven notice the change there you go handsome boy rinna told him he just continued purring as he looked up beatifically into her face after a quiet moment to regroup the teens were off again on the narrative finally they came to the point where harry said i should tell you about what professor trelawney said rinna asked professor trelawney who that our divination teacher she an absolute crackpot hermione explained but this was different hermione harry insisted he proceeded to tell them about the incident in the tower classroom and the prediction the professor had made rinna was deep in thought how did that one part go the dark lord will rise again with his servant aid greater and more terrible than he ever was she mused you cantpossibly believe that it was a legitimate prediction hermione cried rinna turned to her i dontknow professor trelawney she is new to hogwarts since i was there but i will tell you this true prophecies do exist granted they are subject to the vagaries of human whim and choices which is why no prophecy is truly set in stone but rinna felt a prickle run up her spine she would need to look into this i wish i had just killed pettigrew when i had a chance harry muttered nonsense harry you made the right choice rinna said firmly you said you did not think lily or james would ve wanted sirius or remus to become killers well the same is true for you she looked thoughtful besides you have now spared his life he is indebted to you she grinned maliciously the dark lord wontlike that one bit that what professor dumbledore told me harry muttered then he added he the only one besides you that i ve told about the prophecy well then rinna began but she was interrupted by molly calling the four of them for dinner after a huge dinner and dessert everyone but percy who again had work to do went to the living room to sprawl on the rug or the furniture fred draped himself over the armrests of an easy chair and groaned i feel like a blood swollen tick oh thanks for that lovely imagery snapped ginny sarcastically now i feel sick just donthurl on me little sis advised george after some more good natured banter bill suddenly sat up and snapped his fingers i almost forgot he turned to rinna i found an old trunk up in the attic i believe it belongs to you i ll just run up and get it he sprinted up the stairs as if he hadntjust consumed seconds and thirds at dinner eliciting a groan from many in the room bill came down the stairs with a trunk levitated in front of him rinna bemused expression changed to one of slight shock she had almost forgotten the trunk and she certainly remembered why she had left it behind she did not want to look through it not with harry nearby ready to spring all kinds of questions on her except there was one thing in there she knew he d like to see charlie too bill set it on the coffee table and looked at rinna your trunk m lady oh bill thanks for going to the trouble of bringing it down there really isntanything of monumental importance in there just a bunch of old school things i ll take it home and rummage through it at my leisure quite suddenly she was filled with a need to see it the most precious thing in the chest without consideration she said though there is something in here that i want to check on to make sure it has weathered storage well rinna tapped the lock of the trunk with her wand and murmured an incantation the lock opened she lifted the lid and reached in in her hand was a tiny broom she spoke the enlarging charm and suddenly was holding an old model broom that was in excellent condition charlie whistled appreciatively is that a silver dart it gorgeous he reached for it may i she handed it to him right it a silver dart 1001 le the others crowded around charlie to marvel at the broom the light wood had a finish that gave it a silvery sheen and it was accented with emerald green harry frowned at the slytherin like color scheme but had to admit admiringly that it complemented the broom well carved in the handle also in green to match was the name dunlevy the broom did not look one bit worse for wear at having been stored for so long rinna watched charlie harry and the others admire the beautiful craftsmanship and her heart dropped into her stomach idiot what were you thinking bringing that out she obviously hadntbeen thinking just caught up in the moment of seeing the beautiful broom again without weighing the consequences without thinking of the memories the broom would call up the memories that now laid into her gut with stunning force handsome face smiling dark blue eyes lit up with mischief and delight tantalizing lips saying do you like it it practically grabbed me by the neck and screamed i was made for rinna and i knew i had to get it for you now kiss me and tell me you wontforget me while you are at hogwarts his lips warm against hers her mouth moving against his as she whispered you dolt i going to see you every hogsmeade weekend and i love it rinna rinna startled she looked up disoriented and almost dizzy what i asked if you d mind if i have a go on her charlie looked at her eagerly charlie looked so much like the eight year old boy she had last seen that she had to laugh all right then take er up me too can i have a go after charlie and me grateful for the distraction she smiled it is fine with me molly arthur arthur smiled widely and said everyone outside then there was a mad scramble for the door the silvery handle of the silver dart flashing in charlie hands molly and arthur waited for the crush to die down rinna snapped the trunk closed and turned to them thank you for keeping this for me she said quietly her eyes met molly s who read the sadness there we can continue to store it for you dear if you want molly said to her it does not take up much space i wouldntwant to impose on you anymore it is not an imposition you know arthur said pointedly we want you to always consider this your home rinna rinna was reminded after her conversation with harry earlier that afternoon that the magic albus dumbledore had placed on harry and the dursley home was the same magic that had been used on her and the weasleys years earlier no wonder i feel so safe here she realized deeply touched tears welled up in rinna eyes look i know i was rough on you especially at the end nonsense snapped arthur you are family families endure the rough times we will always be here for you nodding in agreement molly held out her arms to the younger woman and rinna readily stepped into her embrace arthur put his arms around the two of them they remained in this manner for several moments until a loud whoop from outdoors startled them we d best get outside before your broom is smashed to smithereens molly suggested with a twinkle in her eye rinna was greeted by the sight of charlie on the dart barreling head first toward the ground in a wronski feint type maneuver he leveled out at the last heart stopping second with another loud whoop the assembly clapped and cheered he touched down with a flourish dismounted the broom and walked toward rinna grinning broadly merlin broomstick rinna she a beaut none the worse for wear either you should take it up he handed the broom to her sorry i didntlet you have first go he said sheepishly i planned it that way charlie so you could check it for safety she teased him with the broom back in her hands her stomach did a flip flop she fiercely squelched any more memories threw her leg over the broom and rocketed straight up into the moonlit sky up up up she went higher and higher feeling the wind rush against her skin stripping away the memories the pain the weight of her problems until it felt like she was lighter than air how could she have forgotten the exhilaration of flying she paused at the apex of her trajectory hanging in the starry sky defying gravity for a long moment and then she plunged downward spiraling and looping the broom responding like a live thing to her every nuance flashing like liquid silver in the moonlight it was like a ballet like a dance with a lover inspiring invigorating and heady she did not want the moment to end she closed her eyes and leveled out and allowed the summer night air to caress her face but like a glamourie spell the illusion of weightlessness and freedom came to an end as she sped over the burrow and saw her audience she began a slow turn to take her back to the weasleys yard dipping and swerving and generally testing the capabilities of the dart charlie was right the old broom handled beautifully harry watched rinna fly deep in thought she certainly knew how to handle a broom he wondered if she had played quidditch at hogwarts and grew momentarily irritated that he did not know more about his godmother as he watched her circle to land he was amazed at how happy the expression on her face was and for a moment how young she looked he recognized the look on her face it was a look i he i wore only when practicing or playing quidditch she loves to fly just like me he smiled and twitched with anticipation of getting his hands on that broom and flying in the moonlight applause rang in the air as rinna walked toward harry taking in the dreamy smile and twitchy expectation her eyes fastened onto his and for a jarring moment a connection was forged between them a recognition of what was held in each other eyes and countenance when it comes to flying we are kindred spirits you and i she wore her lovely genuine smile as she placed the broom in harry hands here harry why dontyou see what you make of her as rinna sat on the steps and watched every move harry made she felt a pang in her heart he should have been with me the sense of loss was as keen as the sharp blade of a dagger she felt as if her heart was off beat and it hurt after the last person had had a chance on the broom everyone found a place to sit as excited jabber filled the air fred and george hit upon the idea of having a backyard quidditch match prior to harry birthday party the following week this was met with great enthusiasm and received instant approval by the party planner herself molly weasley fred turned to rinna and said you will come wontyou rinna looked at harry not sure how he felt about her coming that connective moment during the flying notwithstanding she understood as a matter of course that he may not want her in his life after everything he had found out that afternoon i think i will leave it up to harry who will be on his guest list for his birthday party and pre party quidditch match she said lightly she met harry eyes if you need to fill a position on a team next week you can owl me harry blinked and realized she was leaving the quaffle on his side of the pitch he felt irritated again he wished she would just tell him what she wanted did she want to be back in his life or not he followed her as she slipped into the house rinna was just putting the shrinking charm on the silver dart and placing it back in the trunk when she felt harry presence they were alone together for the first time since the confession under the big tree she turned to face him it went against her nature to let other people make decisions for her and though she knew she shouldntget the last word in she couldntstop herself look harry i d like to come to your party next week if you d have me i really dontwant to miss any more of your birthdays but i d understand if you dontwant me i want you to come harry interrupted you re my godmother of course i want you here she released a breath that she didntrealize she had been holding all right then i ll be here and the pre party quidditch game he raised his eyebrow in a challenging manner she grinned i wouldntmiss it for anything author note this is the portion of our show where i request that you scroll down to that little go button and leave me a review it doesnthave to be a long review even a few words will satisfy me heck i ll be happy if all you leave are a few guttural sounds the point of this little ramble being i d like to hear from you thanks 12 a new definition of family chapter 6 disclosures and intemperance disclaimer this may come as a shock to you but i dontown any of jk rowling characters they do however seem to want to play around in my head hence this story any characters or places you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my fertile and fevered imagination the spells are referenced below the buzzing of insects and chirping of birds was insidiously being supplanted by a tap tap tap at the grimy window of the abandoned work shed groaning with the effort of pulling himself out of the half awake half asleep state he d been in sirius black rolled over and caught a flash of white wing at the window instantly he was on his feet working the warped window open a snowy white owl flew in and landed on a rickety sawhorse she preened proudly before squawking imperiously at sirius she stretched out her leg like a blue blooded lady extending her hand for a kiss sirius chuckled and removed the letter she proffered the smile left his face as he read when he finished he had to sit down as a myriad of questions bombarded him like bludgers in the rush of his mad escape from hogwart s he d had no time to find out what had become of arinna dunlevy how was he to respond to harry note he was completely in the dark sirius sat for a long time half watching hedwig pounce on a few mice rinna just the thought of her brought up so many mixed feelings anger desire betrayal hurt longing bitterness every memory of her was tinged with these emotions and therefore they had not been touched by the dementors during those long years in azkaban being on the lam for a year hunting peter had provided a distraction from the thoughts and ponderings about her that he had nursed like a festering sore during his time in prison now they were back in full force and he needed to winnow out fact from speculation and wishful thinking finally he got up and rummaged through the few belongings he has acquired recently looking for a pencil he turned over the parchment and wrote dear harry arinna dunlevy is your godmother although why she has not revealed that fact to you i cannot fathom on my discovery last year that you had been placed with your aunt and uncle i had my doubts about where her loyalties lie as she was to be your guardian should anything happen to me per your parents wishes i wish i could tell you that you can trust her but i honestly cannot guess as to her motivation for coming back into your life after all these years at best i can say be careful and if you have any doubts or suspicions contact dumbledore or lupin i will be of course seeking out additional information about her and i will contact you as soon as i know anything more i suspect we will be seeing each other sooner than we expected take care of yourself sirius he re read what he wrote realizing that his message was not the least bit reassuring but he did not want harry to be complacent not when voldemort was trying to regain power if he was honest with himself he wanted to believe rinna intentions toward harry were benevolent because he wanted to believe that rinna had not had any part in what happened with lily and james and peter but his experience with peter had taught him that not everything is as it seems and even though you think you know a person well he shook his head no more speculation now is the time to act he tied the note to hedwig leg with a murmur to her to deliver it to harry straightaway he began throwing his meager possessions into a worn knapsack an image of titian hair and emerald eyes entered his mind plush lips parted in a secret smile just for him he sat down hard put his head in his hands and raked his fingers through his hair in a nervous gesture as long as you re being honest with yourself black you might as well admit that you are haring off to england in the hopes of patching things up with her if there is even the smallest chance of that happening he shook his head again no i despise her remember ha admit it you have secretly harbored the dream that your last conversation with her was some huge cosmic joke he sighed that was true he could admit it fully now since there were no dementors here to suck away any hope that thought would bring and since he was apparently having a be honest with yourself moment here anyway well if he was going to embark on some ill advised trip back to the country where he was the most wanted wizard alive he should probably make a few plans and travel under the cloak of darkness seeing as this had worked for him so far he walked over to the hippogriff in the corner oy beaky i going to garner some provisions we ll be leaving at nightfall buckbeak chirruped in reply and nuzzled sirius affectionately i jumping both feet in back into the mess of my own manhunt and for what beaky buckbeak cocked his head to the side inquiringly for a woman who well i dontknow what she is to me anymore i just know that i need answers that only she can give me he chuckled ironically that and the fact that i cannot get her out of my head he clapped buckbeak on his feathery shoulder ah hell beaky james would be laughing his ass off right about now harry ron ginny and hermione were sitting in ron room trying to cool off after a fine game of football on the weasley lawn hermione had brought her ball and taught the game to them harry had a basic understanding of the rules but the others were completely unfamiliar with the muggle game ron had had a great deal of difficulty not using his hands until hermione made him put his hands in his pockets ginny had teased him unmercifully about how silly he looked i thought the best game was the weasley vs non weasley said ron giving his sister a high five oh are you still congratulating yourself on that spectacular block you made with your face grinned hermione kept you from making a goal didnti well i thought the best game was the girls vs boys hermione said right ginny agreed because we kicked your sorry boy arses she and hermione jumped up and gave high fives then pumped their fists in the air oh yeah oh yeah that only because i was stuck with pocket boy harry insisted hey that pocket boy footballer extraordinaire to you mate ron said in mock indignation ugh too many syllables ginny commented i ll just call you p boy instead ron scowled in disgust i think not if you do he started to advance on his sister menacingly i will have to hold you down and drool on you oh why dontyou grow up ronnie p boy still resorting to those old disgusting aaahhh no stop ginny shrieked and ran behind harry save me harry ron attempted to reach around harry saying c mon mate help me out here defend my masculine pride right said harry who turned around and seized ginny by the arms grinning sorry gin i ve got to help the poor bloke out masculine pride and whatnot argh if you try anything then mark my words the first thing i will do when we get on the train to hogwarts is throw a bat bogey hex on you two that will knock you into next week ginny threatened harry let go of her arms as if they were hot pokers he turned back to ron sorry mate swallow your masculine pride i dontever want to be on the receiving end of one of ginny hexes no you bloody well don t ron exclaimed from experience hmph ginny sniffed and flounced over to sit on harry bed next to hermione who was giggling that will teach you to manhandle me little sisters are such pains in the ron admonished hermione ginny huffed brothers you are so lucky you donthave any hermione she flopped back on the bed and hit her head on something hard ow she reached under the covers and pulled out a green leather album what this harry looked up oh that rinna album she left it the other day for me to look at can i look at it asked ginny harry shrugged sure he and ron settled on ron bed for a game of exploding snap hermione moved closer to ginny and took one side of the album helping hold it they turned pages together and admired the artwork and read the journaling commented on the fashions of the day and admired the handsome marauders professor lupin was such a hottie ginny commented i did not hear that groaned ron hermione frowned flipped through a few pages and said harry there are no pictures of sirius in here isntthat odd yeah ginny noted and look at this there are blank spots on these pages and this page is completely empty that weird why is that weird ron wanted to know because the layout doesntlook right it not balanced there should be a picture here and right here look the journaling stops mid sentence like someone erased it you re right agreed hermione look at this compared to the earlier pages it not her style at all to leave big gaps she uses all of the page for pictures writing and artwork or doodads harry shrugged my theory is she took out all the pictures of sirius when she thought he was a murderer hermione was running her fingers over one of the open spaces on the page in front of her hang on it feels like something is here feel it ginny she took ginny fingers and ran them on the page to show her ginny nodded in agreement i think the photos are still here just concealed in some way ginny frowned too bad we arentallowed to do any revealing charms as luck would have it bill passed by the open door on his way up the stairs to his room oy bill ginny called he came back and poked his head in the door yes my darling sister she flashed her sweetest smile at him the one that said i have my oldest brother wrapped around my pinkie finger and he has no idea and said offhandedly we think there is a concealment charm on this what spell would you use to break it bill walked over to the girls pulling out his wand well the simplest one is resolvo veneficus and he tapped the album nothing happened all right we ll try this aspectus invisus for a second nothing happened then there was a slight shimmer like a mirage on a hot day and slowly the missing pictures appeared there nothing to it said bill with satisfaction he turned and strolled out thanks bill you re the best ginny called after him she looked around the room everyone was staring at her with mouths open rather handy having a curse breaker in the family hmm she asked nonchalantly i can not believe how easily you manipulated bill into doing that it almost creepy harry said admiringly ginny held her curled fingers in front of her face blew on them then extended her hand palm out and admired her fingernails it a gift she said airily hermione was goggling at the page that had formerly been completely empty oh my goodness harry come here you have got to see this harry strode over to her and took the album the others crowded around him looking over his shoulder one of the photos showed sirius and rinna hugging and falling off the couch the next showed them getting back on the couch laughing hysterically several had them smiling and kissing a slightly larger one was of the two of them dancing rinna head on sirius chest his chin resting on the top of her head he then took her in his arms and dipped her dramatically pulling her back up to him and kissing her soundly the largest picture of all showed a grinning sirius taking rinna left hand and moving it toward the camera a beautiful ring made of an oval ruby with diamonds on either side was on her ring finger under that picture written in rinna handwriting and surrounded by little drawn hearts was the word engaged bloody hell breathed ron harry sat down abruptly he felt light headed do you suppose they were married when you know when sirius went to azkaban ginny asked quietly i dontknow said harry dully hermione was suddenly very angry for harry sake well this is just typical of her isntit the others looked at her quizzically leaving you to discover yet another rather immense and important fact about her instead of coming right out and telling you hermione harry perked up but hermione was not finished i mean really harry she has not been straightforward with you not once why is she so secretive getting information from her is like pulling teeth ron smiled a little trust hermione daughter of dentists to use such a metaphor hermione sat down next to harry huffing out her breath it frustrating as hell harry looked at her askance not used to hearing hermione swear she was mad as a hornet and so very protective of him it was sweet and endearing he reached over and gave her a side hug what do you want me to do mione hold her down and demand answers to questions i dontknow exist actually that sounds like a good idea what i d really like to do she growled is harry interrupted her with another hug you re just mad because you hate not knowing everything she looked into his face seriously no i mad because it is so unfair to you it like she messing about with you harry sighed just when i felt like i wasntso mad at rinna anymore this comes along rinna was catching up on housework absentmindedly dusting the furniture while her mind replayed her conversation with harry and his friends yet again she had been wrong in thinking it would be easier to hear about sirius innocence and peter subterfuge the second time yet she couldntstop thinking about it now and the prophecy by the divination professor harry told her about she couldntshake the feeling that it was true his words had resonated in her soul as she felt the thrum of truth in them she may have spent the last three years largely ignoring her magical birthright but she could not escape her magical instincts she felt it in her gut peter who had been the traitor among them was now returning to his master of this she had no doubt her musings were interrupted when her foot struck a small hard object under the coffee table curious she bent to pick it up it was the ornamental glass top to the fire whiskey decanter she and remus had emptied that day in june when he d come to tell her about sirius well we hadntpolished it off completely there had been about a finger width of liquor still left in the bottom that next day she sat on the couch housework forgotten absently twirling the glass top in her hand as she recalled that day yet again for a long time remus and rinna sat on the couch in silence completely still except for the occasional movement of bringing glass to lips and swallowing when rinna glass was empty he leaned forward to refill it she brought it to her mouth paused as if reconsidering then tipped her head back and knocked it down in one fell swoop she set the glass on the coffee table and indicated she needed a refill remus looked at her and frowned she impatiently took the bottle from him and poured it herself to his relief she returned to merely sipping at the glass she stared broodingly at the bottle on the table refusing to meet his eyes for a very long time remus finished his drink and started another eventually she shifted her position on the couch and looked at remus her green eyes full of sadness oh remus she breathed full of regret how could i have believed that sirius had killed peter and all those people it seems so obvious now we were all manipulated rinna he answered each of us was given enough reason to doubt the others i so angry with myself remy she interrupted i know i feel the same way angry and upset that i believed it at all she was quiet for a few moments all this time she said softly i thought i was to blame that i was the one who pushed him too far pushed him over the edge pushed him to voldemort she put her head in her hands because i had because i broke his heart this was not new information to remus hey luv hey he reached his hand out to touch her shoulder now you know it not true doesntit help to know that she gave a mirthless snort it was bad enough remy when i thought breaking off the engagement resulted in him cracking and turning coat but now i feel even more terrible knowing that he spent all those years in azkaban completely innocent and thinking that i didntlove him thinking about what i d said to him she lapsed into silence again remus downed the remaining contents of his glass was this the second or third and poured more he swirled the whiskey around contemplating if he dared take the path of past deeds and recriminations any further on the one hand he felt it would be beneficial for her to talk about things and process her feelings for a change on the other hand it would require him to open some old wounds too rinna actions had affected remus as well putting him in an untenable position with sirius those many years ago it had surprised him that she had acted the way she did for she had never in all the years he had known her been cruel or selfish before and then that night happened and everything went wrong he had never demanded an explanation for what she did never talked to her about it out of deference to her then fragile mental state and later well later he had buried it deep enough that it didntbear dragging out after all those years but now the discovery of peter betrayal and sirius innocence was fresh in his mind and he was angry with himself and rinna was playing her guilt and blame game again and the whiskey was whispering to him to let down the walls a bit he took a deep breath and tossed back the latest glass of liquor i talked to him a few days after after you broke it off he was devastated he told her her breath hitched in a gasping sob but he didntstop anger and resentment started to surface from where ever he had kept it buried for so long fed by the slight inebriation he felt he thought that you and i were having an affair oh god remus oh no rinna gut wrenched she had wounded her lover even more than she had ever realized and wounded remus who having never been anything but a proper gentleman around rinna had to defend himself to his best friend oh dontworry he said with a bitter note to his voice i was finally able to convince him that we weren t though i think he would have felt better if it had been true he couldntthink of any reason for you to end the relationship otherwise he looked at her sullenly neither could i she remained still head in her hands not answering he did not tell her that sirius did think of one other reason why rinna would call it off that rinna had been seduced by the enemy why did you do it rinna he whispered harshly rinna felt as if her heart had been spitted on the stiletto blade of his words why had she done it the singularly biggest mistake of her life she would never be able to explain adequately but she had to try she owed remus an explanation especially after unwittingly getting him involved and she realized if she was ever in the position to do so she owed sirius one as well i had managed to infiltrate far enough into my assigned targets in voldemort service she began to be privy to information indicating that the dark lord had his eye on sirius to recruit him apparently it was at bellatrix behest she was sweating with the effort never getting louder than a whisper remus looked at her sharply and realized that if she was revealing information about covert activities she had been involved in then she must be fighting against a spell of compulsion all operatives of the order had undergone such compulsion spells voluntarily in order to safeguard the strategies and secret plans of the order he opened his mouth to tell her to stop but she raised her hand to him s okay let me finish she rasped the next part was said with less effort because she was no longer revealing order secrets but it somehow seemed far more difficult to get out i dontknow i just lost my sense of judgment i suppose i always did when he was concerned i thought that i would be used as a means to bring him in so if i made him hate me he d have no reason to come after me if i was used as bait why didntyou tell anyone tell dumbledore why didntyou tell sirius what you knew remus asked in despair understanding her panic but also seeing the fatal flaw in her thinking that led to so much heartache i dontknow i dontknow she screamed as she shot up from the couch she pulled at her hair and paced the living room do you think that i dontask myself those very questions every day remus do you think that i dontregret my actions her voice raised in pitch in her anxiety i play in my head each thing i should have done differently i come up with every what if scenario i made the worst decision of my life and i have regretted it every single second of every single day of the last thirteen years i look back and see how stupid and na ve i was damn it remus i was so young and so stupid she reached for the whiskey decanter but remus pulled it away concerned pour me another effing glass remus she growled dangerously he capitulated and poured and watched her closely she swayed and took a large gulp from the glass she sat down next to him on the couch i had second thoughts believe me i had made up my mind to go to sirius and tell him everything and beg his forgiveness when she faltered he finished her sentence in a somber voice when you were captured yeah she murmured i never had the chance remus reached over and pulled her to him in a side hug she laid her head on his shoulder nothing has been right since that day you know her voice was barely audible they downed their drinks and remus poured more he d long ago lost track of how many he d had he was sure she d had more now your chance tell her how hurt you are tell her she not the only one struggling with this the fire whiskey seemed to whisper in his head he cleared his throat every close friend i had was taken away from me in a matter of days every one but you and i feared i would lose you too those days at st mungo s i was so afraid of never getting you back she reached for his empty hand and squeezed it and once you were better i never told you how angry i was at what you did to sirius i was afraid that i d push me back over the edge she finished for him yes and then you left me and i was even angrier with you rinna i felt i dontknow like an orphan abandoned and betrayed rinna heart stopped momentarily she thought of the little boy truly orphaned whom she left as well the two people who remained who meant more to me than anything remus and harry i left them it wasntyou i didntleave you remus i told you why i had to go his voice was laced with sorrow my head understood your reasons for leaving but my heart my heart couldntcomprehend it she shifted her position on the couch turning to him and gently placing her hand on the side of his face oh remy why did you not tell me this when i returned to england his eyelids slid closed he felt blinded by the intensity of emotion in her intoxicatingly green eyes i was just glad to have you back rinna you were back you were hurting and i didntwant to rock the boat i just wanted everything to be all right between us he heard her breathe in sharply and opened his eyes he was startled to see her eyes welling with tears how could things be all right between us when i have been such a miserably selfish bitch to you she cried i am so sorry i didntrealize how much i had hurt you that i hurt you when i hurt sirius when i left and even now i take your love and friendship for granted donti how can you even bear to be around me remus the words tumbled without hindrance from her mouth her head swam with the effects of the alcohol and her ever present facade was breaking apart he took her hand and tried to shush her but she was not consolable you and sirius you were the two men i loved most in my life and look what i did to each of you the tears that had been threatening to spill finally sprang forth and rolled down her cheeks and she sat unable to move gasping and sobbing her body shook and she couldntstop crying fueled by intoxication and overwhelmed by all she had learned that day she broke down as remus put his arms around her and pulled her to him resting her head on his chest and running soothing hands up and down her back he held her close to him and stroked her hair and her back and let her cry maybe this will help her please let this help her after a very long time rinna pulled away from his chest and looked at the large wet stain on his shirt i suh sorry i slob slobbered all over you she got out between shuddering breaths s okay he said softly and he pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket and gently wiped the tears from her cheeks he brushed his fingers along her forehead pushing aside her hair that stuck there she sighed and leaned back against the couch eyes closed he took her hand remembering the trick she would do in school of pushing on pressure points in the hand to calm and soothe and did his best to caress the points he could recall d you feel any better his voice was deep with concern her answer was faint and he had to lean in to hear nothing makes me feel any better i ve done things for which i dontthink i will ever be forgiven i canteven forgive myself rinna his voice was just above a whisper she opened her eyes and looked into his i forgive you for all that is mine to forgive please do not torment yourself anymore i cantbear it rinna mind reeled stoked by mixed emotions and fire whiskey and a funny heaviness in her chest i dontknow how to stop the guilt and the pain anymore it all spinning out of my control help me remus she whispered remus watched as several tears spilled down her cheeks and moved excruciatingly slowly past the corner of her mouth his eyes traced their path as the tears slid over her jaw and trickled down her neck finally coming to rest in the hollow just above the breast bone they shimmered there fuzzily as her chest rose and fell in little quivering movements mesmerized he watched the pool of tears sparkle like a jewel at her throat without thinking he leaned forward and placed a kiss there he felt her sharp intake of breath when his lips touched her neck and she squeezed his hand that was holding hers he pulled away tasting the salt of her tears on his lips she was looking at him her green eyes wide part of his mind screamed at him to stop before he crossed a line but the alcohol singing in his veins made him bold he cupped her face in his hand tenderly wiping one last tear with his thumb her eyes fluttered closed as she leaned into the caress he pulled her to him into an embrace tucking her head under his chin and stroking her back her hair smelled like herbs or chamomile he wasntsure so he inhaled her scent again she smelled wonderful and his stomach flip flopped ever so slightly he dropped a kiss on the top of her head she tilted her chin to look up at him eyelids heavy over emerald orbs full pink lips parted as she took a deep breath a slight flush high in her cheeks his resolve broke ignoring the warning screaming faintly in the back of his head he bent forward and captured her lips with his she felt warm and tasted of salt and whiskey his heart pounded and his breath hitched as she fisted her hand in his hair pulling him to her and deepening the kiss remus felt all peripheral awareness slip away until his only thought was of her hot demanding mouth and the exquisite sounds she was making deep in her throat her lips parted and the tip of her tongue traced his lower lip remus groaned and captured her upper lip with both of his before letting go and tracing kisses along her jaw to the base of her earlobe she leaned her head to the side giving him access as he hungrily kissed her neck to the collar bone everything seemed to be happening in slow motion as if she was sluggishly wading through all the fire whiskey she had consumed a hint of a thought nipped at her suggesting that she should not be here on her couch with remus so delightfully pressed up against her she pushed away the thought she just wanted to float in the alcohol induced euphoria that clouded memories and felt so good she hadntbeen kissed so deliciously in so long and remus felt warm and smelled of soap and musk and rinna took his face in her hands and dragged his mouth back to hers kissing him urgently and thoroughly then she fluttered kisses on his cheeks and neck finding a sensitive spot behind his ear he groaned again as she lapped and nipped at the area with voracity making half whimpering half moaning sounds in his ear remus took her with him as he stretched out on the couch and he proceeded to return her kisses on her throat collar bone and down the opening of her blouse he felt her hands untucking his shirt and slipping under the hem to stroke caressingly up to his nipples her hands seemed to cast spells that made his body buzz he untangled his hand from her hair and unfastened the top button of her blouse then lavished kisses on the soft skin between her breasts he felt her tremble underneath him he felt his body respond rinna squirmed under him in a most enticing manner and he realized she was trying to roll him onto his back which may have worked if not for the narrowness of the couch she almost pushed him off but he saved himself at the last minute by pressing the length of his body fully against her his face landed conveniently right back in her d collet and not being a man to waste a good opportunity he laved the spot with his tongue remy she murmured huskily mmmm remy thish couch is too schm too small for us mmm hmmm he replied get up silly where i going someplace better she slurred miraculously they managed to get to their feet and rinna grabbed his shirt front to keep from toppling over he steadied her with his arms and she tugged him down the hall their progress was slow since they had to stop every step or so to lean against something rinna knees seemed to have turned to jelly and remus was not much better off they clung to each other and inched their way gradually toward her room rinna could not understand how her cozy house had gotten so large she giggled wha so funny remus wanted to know i feel squiffy remus snorted tha an undersh an undershtatement if i ve ever heard one oh look we re here she said in surprise remus eyes widened as he realized where they were but she dragged him forward before he could protest not that he really wanted to protest next thing he knew he had tumbled with her into the bed she used his momentum to roll him onto his back and she propped on one elbow above him he knew he was leering at her drunkenly she looked at him and smiled her eyes slightly glassy thish is better dontcha think she asked thickly he nodded and regretted it as the room began to spin rinna fumbled up to her hands and knees which took a few attempts and then crawled on top of him to straddle his thighs she made the mistake of sitting up abruptly ooooh she grabbed her head and swayed too fast she slumped back down and put her head on remus chest and took some deep breaths i need to lie down he put his arms around her and rolled slightly to the side so she settled on her hip but her one leg was still draped over his thighs her head was in the hollow of his shoulder and she sighed a minute passed then two remus heartbeat began to slow slightly he ran his hand down rinna back rinna rin she stirred against him and murmured something unintelligible he chuckled he would try to rouse her in a minute but first he just wanted to lay here and enjoy the feel of her warm body against him and close his eyes for just a little while until the spinning stopped the sun had already set when remus opened his eyes again he was in an unfamiliar bed feeling rather inebriated and he couldntfeel his arm his usually quick mind took a few extra heartbeats before he remembered where he was and who he was with i really should move to the couch it would be the proper thing to do but he realized that he no longer wanted to do the proper thing not with rinna lying here in bed with him in his embrace besides he knew there was no way he could make that long trek back to the living room without falling he squirmed trying to get his numb arm out from under her and she stirred against him blackie she breathed remus caught his breath in a moment of clarity that cut through the alcohol haze remus realized that he still was living in sirius shadow in all things where this woman was concerned that the way it was back then and nothing has changed yet no luv it remus oh remy her words were still slurred i had the oddest dream bout sirius i dreamt he was innocent i know rinna now go back to sleep despite the boldness imparted to him by the fire whiskey he was too much of a gentleman to take advantage of her in her state of inebriety sighing in frustration he moved his arm from under her and resettled her against him holding her close and wishing that just this once he might ve been the man at the forefront of her conscious and subconscious thoughts early morning light came softly through the window rinna opened her eyes when she became cognizant that she was spooned with her back flush against a masculine form and an arm around her waist remus her mind identified for her well here a fine situation she realized that she had never thought of someday finding herself in such a position because she had been struggling to keep her heart from feeling anything really these last few years and it had never occurred to her to think their relationship could be more than platonic and certainly not as the result of imbibing in entirely too much alcohol slowly and carefully she turned over feeling his hand slip across her belly as she did so he stirred and tightened his arm around her possessively but didntwake and damn but she liked the way it felt to have his arm around her her face was close to his now and she looked at him as he slept eyes wandering over his familiar features sandy hair shot through ever so slightly with hints of gray here and there slightly darker brows and eyelashes hiding hazel eyes she loved his eyes handsome face that was marked by a few scars and the recently acquired scratches the scars did not mar his features only served to make him look a bit rakish a smile played at her lips as she remembered the first time remus had spoken to her truly spoken to her in a conversation at the beginning of her fourth year at hogwarts it was in the library of course he saw me working on my transfiguration essay and sat down across from me he smiled at me and oh sweet merlin that smile i dontthink i got any more work done that evening they had bandied about the essay topic for a bit not even stopping as lily joined them until the marauders had come along and commandeered him no doubt for the perpetration of some mischief she was thirteen years old and she was smitten and now a little more than twenty years later he looked perfect lying here in her bed with his arm draped around her her eyes widened in realization of what she was thinking am i falling for remus am i still drunk what is going on she knew she had better get her feelings for this man sorted out before remus hand tightened on her hip where it rested then his eyes opened and looked right into hers she watched as they widened in surprise then darkened in color at the memory of the night before he snatched his hand away from her body as if he d been burned to her chagrin she blushed like the thirteen year old she d just recalled the situation was about as awkward as being caught necking in a broom closet by your transfiguration professor what the hell why is my mind bringing up sirius at a time like this it was time for some damage control uhm good morning she said oh that is just brilliant girl he rolled onto his back and groaned there is nothing good about the pounding in my head rinna giggled giggling my stars what has gotten into me stop it this instant rinna s matter old man canthold your liquor he turned back again to look at her scowling you mean to tell me that you are not feeling any effects from the fire whiskey you mean the dull throb in my head the dry mouth and the feeling that i ll be violently ill if i stand upright nope hadntnoticed she smirked wickedly you are a vile wench remind me to never get drunk with you again why because we become too brutally honest with each other or because we end up in bed together remus winced look about that dontyou dare apologize remus lupin we are both adults there is nothing wrong with what we did or didntdo as the case may be he looked at her seriously choosing his words carefully i wontdeny that i am rather attracted to you rinna it just that i dontwant to do anything that would jeopardize our friendship she flopped back onto her back and sighed and you think that the two of us being more than friends would i dontknow part of him was screaming to just tell her he wanted her as so much more than a friend but the logical practical part of him remembered her calling for sirius while she lay in his arms if sirius was here now he had no doubt which of the two she would choose do i really want to get involved in a relationship when her heart belongs to someone else the reckless side of him insisted yes she spoke quietly thinking of disturbing the status quo scares me a little too he propped up on his elbow to get a better look at her let just see what happens does that sound all right she smiled at him she knew she loved him dearly maybe they should just see what develops absolutely she rolled to the other side and carefully sat up what are you doing remus wondered i going to attempt to crawl to the loo she informed him carefully cradling her head in her hands she gamely heaved herself to her feet and regretted it immediately on second thought i think i ll just lie down looks like we are stuck here for a while she snorted well at least the company is nice certainly better than the last time i got completely pissed he didntrise to the bait i not even going to ask it was the worst hangover either of them had had in a very long time rinna looked into the glass top watching as the light caught in the glass and made tiny rainbows it occurred to her that she had spent a large portion of her life focusing on a period of less than two weeks granted she had lost her fianc her best friend and her husband her sanity and her godson some of that she could change like with harry some of that she couldn t i miss you so much lily and some of that well time would tell under girding all the pain all the guilt all the sorrow was anger deep righteous soul rendering anger one person was responsible for this the one person whose power she had sworn to contest till she no longer had breath in her body voldemort she thought of the people she cared about remus harry dorrie the weasleys dumbledore sirius none of them were safe if voldemort returned to power her hands gripped the glass stopper tightly she had forsaken her oath long enough now was the time to reclaim her power and the purpose she had set for herself when she left england she would somehow be instrumental in bringing the dark lord down she took the glass top and hurled it into the fireplace listening in satisfaction as it splintered into tiny pieces her reticence shattered with it she knew what she had to do now a n wondering what bill spells mean in english well resolvo veneficus dispel magic aspectus invisus see unseen latin courtesy of gamewyrd well it the longest chapter yet i d like to know what you thought so you know what to do mosey on down to the review button and leave me a review i will be so very happy if you do 17 a new definition of family chapter 7 the best laid plans disclaimer this may come as a shock to you but i dontown any of jk rowling characters they do however seem to want to play around in my head hence this story any characters or places or book titles you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my fertile and fevered imagination remus lupin was strolling the last few blocks to rinna house deep in thought he hadntseen her since the last planning meeting before removing harry from his muggle family and he hadntheard from her since either today he had a different reason for seeing her for which he was glad because he d realized he was gong to miss those tactical meetings he had enjoyed having an excuse to see her every week not that he needed an excuse she was his oldest friend after all he was concerned for her she was still distancing herself from the wizarding world although she had conceded to allow her fireplace to be added to the floo network that was a start and she d brewed them a hangover relief potion last month once she could finally stand up but those instances notwithstanding she was still keeping herself aloof he knew that she had come back to england a bit well spooked as if she d seen and experienced things she just wanted to forget she had insisted on removing herself from the wizarding world and fortunately albus dumbledore had hit on a brilliant plan for her to be able to enter the muggle world yet maintain her wizarding ties despite that he reflected she had not been able to escape her demons remus had hoped that meeting harry would have pulled her out of her funk even just a little bit he had been the one who suggested enlisting her help to dumbledore who also had hopes of pulling her out of her shell the two men became co conspirators in their attempt to shake her from her reticence her door swung open and she practically pounced on him as she eagerly pulled him inside i glad you are your usual prompt self remy i ve made a few changes to our plans and we need to get going right away if you kept the hours of a normal person and not some nocturnal creature then we could have started much earlier you know he replied amused she pulled a face at him and then swept into the living room carefully avoiding knocking over the parchments that were in stacks on her coffee table and couch remus surveyed the room in wonder there were piles of papers old leather bound books an old ratty looking trunk is that her broom from school and many cauldrons of various sizes and very well made all marring the usual neatness of the room he thumbed the nearest book it was who who in the wizarding world the one underneath it was ancient magical family trees the wizard complete guide to pureblood genealogy annotated the other books seemed to be various texts but on closer inspection of the titles he knew they werentfrom any classes she had taken at hogwarts what in merlin name she interrupted him could you grab those three medium sized cauldrons and bring them to the kitchen for me there a good lad she raised her eyebrow at him as she carried her largest cauldron with two hands and made for the kitchen he grinned at her suggestive look he had to admit to himself that his infatuation for the red head had not diminished at all frustratingly they had not been able to explore any possibilities of progressing their relationship further every time they had seen each other there had been others present he was rather looking forward to having her all to himself for the rest of the day he moved across the room to comply with her request his momentum was arrested by a very official looking parchment on the coffee table it was brand new freshly inked and read curriculum vitae for arinna dunlevy he paused to glance at it in curiosity carefully picking it up and reading she had written him at least several times a year for those ten years she had spent studying abroad and had told him some of the classes she had been taking some of the magical arts she had chosen to pursue but a quick glance showed him she had not been forthright in all that she had undertaken left out some of the more interesting subjects didntyou rinna dear her academic record made his credentials to teach defense against the dark arts look rather puny indeed and he was no lightweight in the dark arts her voice calling him from the kitchen interrupted his disturbing reverie sorry hang on i coming he said quickly as he grabbed the cauldrons by the handles and double timed it to the kitchen i thought i said we were in a hurry she said acerbically as he set the cauldrons on the table with a clang i was distracted by the mess out there he smirked what are you up to anyway i am taking a page out of the remus lupin book of employment and no that doesntmean i going to get all hairy once a month and get myself sacked she teased playfully i was not sacked i resigned he said with dignity and what in the hell are you talking about she laughed at his puzzled expression i am going to be an educator what an educator a teacher a professor a tutor she huffed with some impatience yes i know what an educator is silly but just where are you planning on embarking on this new career his eyes widened as he made the connection between what she was saying and what he d seen in the living room you are not considering what i think you are considering now it was her turn to look puzzled what do you mean how could you know what i considering i only just told you he stepped up to her and took her by the shoulders i think you are looking to hire yourself out as a private tutor in the dark arts to a dark wizarding family her mouth fell open in shock she blinked stupidly several times remus almost smiled at how comical her expression was she closed her mouth with a snap and said i know i am a top notch occulomens there is no way you could have pulled that from my head how in all the bloody moons of jupiter did you i saw your curriculum vitae out there he let go of her rubbing her shoulders where he had been gripping rather tightly i must say with your credentials you are the dream tutor that all the top dark families are looking for the malfoys the notts the goyles would all be giving their eyeteeth to have you none of them have primary school aged children anymore she smirked feeling a bit disturbed that she was secretly pleased at his praise he stopped to consider her well you have certainly been doing your homework he said but seriously rinna dontyou think it is just a bit counter productive to our plan of routing voldemort if you are out there teaching little future death eaters the dark arts no no that not it i would be on the inside again able to get information on what voldemort is planning the look on his face stopped her are you drunk he asked bluntly now she was mad and insulted what i asked are you drunk because that the only explanation i can think of for this insane plan of yours in case you dontrecall what happened to you the last time you were on the inside let me just remind you that you ended up in the hands of voldemort himself i know and you were abused and you lost your m i know she glared viciously at him he absorbed her glare impassively i will be damned he said clearly and deliberately if i ever let you get involved with death eaters or near that crazy bastard voldemort again he held her gaze and she saw the determination in his eyes she would not be able to persuade him of the validity of her plan she could see that she sighed and slumped into a chair at her table leaning forward and smacking her forehead onto her arms crossed on the tabletop he sat next to her pushing the cauldrons out of his way and bravely reaching over to stroke her hair what has gotten you into this frenzy all of a sudden anyway i thought you were keeping a low profile she liked the way his hands felt in her hair so she didntlift her head to speak something that harry told me i convinced that we will see the dark lord quite hale and hearty in the near future remus what did harry tell you he wondered she reluctantly lifted her self up and proceeded to tell him about the prophecy made by professor trelawney remus thought for several moments about what rinna had told him he took a deep breath in through his nose i afraid i rather of the same mind as hermione about sybil trelawney he said i wouldntput much stock in what she cut him off where else will peter go he always gravitated to someone big enough and powerful enough to protect him besides i just know it is true she gave a little shudder he looked at her sharply having a moment of precognition are we yes she whispered you know i ve been right about voldemort in the past he felt goosebumps prickle his skin all right i ll agree that this changes things but i would feel much better if you talk with albus before you send out any letters of intention to any wizarding families he took her chin in his hand and turned her to look at him he locked her eyes with his will you agree to that she considered a moment before nodding her head in acquiescence remus breathed an inward sigh of relief he stood up from the table and looked at the cauldrons so have you decided that brewing potions in your saucepans is an inferior art form he teased her again remembering the potion she had whipped up to relive the agony left by the fire whiskey they d consumed his words brought her back to the present task she quickly stood up snapping her fingers we have got to get to diagon alley we have an appointment and yes i want to make sure this next potion i brew is absolutely perfect so i did a little unpacking remus grabbed her hand thank you for taking this on for me he told her quietly the wolfsbane potion of course i would take it on i need to watch out for you you know if i d known you were going to use an old potion that was supposed to be used up in june i d have pulled out the cauldrons sooner she chided him she had been upset when he owled her to tell her that his last transformation had not gone well because the efficacy of the potion snape had brewed him had worn off a bit in storage and would she consider brewing him a new batch she lifted her hand to his face and patted his cheek and thank you for going all protective on me a few moments ago you chivalrous old wolf you she smiled at him i need to watch out for you too you re the only school chum i have left he placed his hand over hers and pressed her hand into his cheek she put her other hand on the other side of his face and pulled him down brushing his lips with a sweet chaste kiss you are too good to me remus lupin she said to him lightly and i not the only one you have left or have you forgotten that you have sirius back her phrasing was not lost on him you have him back not we have him back he sighed sirius is on the run and hopefully well hidden and i hope he stays that way until his name is cleared there isntmuch chance of me seeing him till then all the better for me to hog your protective person to myself then she said with satisfaction and smiled up at him seemingly of their own accord one of his hands cupped her jaw while the other slipped to the back of her neck he pulled her in for another kiss this time not so chaste hog me all you want he said hoarsely before kissing her deeply again her arms were slipping around his neck when the hall clock bonged once much to remus dismay rinna tore her lips away from him damn it it is half past eleven we have an appointment right now she grabbed his wrist and tugged him back to the living room snatching up her money purse and a shopping list on the way what appointment what are you talking about i ll tell you after we floo let go she indicated the bowl of floo powder on the mantel soon they were walking quickly down the sidewalk in diagon alley we are meeting dorrie for lunch at the rusty rapier remus groaned well there go any plans for alone time he thought frustratedly thanks for giving me so much advanced warning oh shut it she is my only girlfriend i ve missed her since i moved out suddenly rinna stopped in her tracks what is it remus asked with concern i was just thinking do you think we should tell her she leaned closer to remus about sirius he was her favorite cousin and she was very upset about what happened with him i suppose but not here in diagon alley too much possibility of someone overhearing us agreed she frowned in thought let invite her to my place for dinner and tell her then she did not see remus face fall nor any of the emotions that flickered briefly across his face remus schooled his features to an impassive look grunted an affirmative and they resumed their brisk walk arriving shortly at the little out of the way pub dorrie favored sorry we re late rinna apologized as she slipped in the booth next to her former roommate remus and i were uh discussing employment options remus interjected smoothly wotcher remus rinna they were greeted i wasntwaiting long hello tonks long time no see remus replied he took in her short black hair shot through with streaks of burgundy and purple somehow she always managed to pull off her outrageous styles without looking ridiculous sorry that it didntwork out for you at hogwarts remus tonks told him he glanced at rinna then back to tonks well you re all caught up with my life then how is the auror business going for you well at least i not considered a newbie any more she smiled it is going fine i think she turned to rinna so tell me how did operation extraction go tonks eyes twinkled in anticipation of a good story they took a moment to order lunch then rinna recounted the story of retrieving harry from the dursleys they were all careful to not say any names secrecy was second nature to these three so what do you think of him tonks asked remus had been about to ask that very question he leaned in to hear rinna answer well he reminds me very much of his mother you think so remus asked he reminds me very strongly of his father oh no he may look a lot like his father but he is more like his mother she argued remus snorted well you haventseen him in action at hogwarts has a real knack for mischief that one it was rinna turn to snort methinks that is the pot calling the kettle black it takes one to know one remy everyone laughed rinna sat back with a sigh i think i frustrate him he wants to know everything and he doesntlet up it been really hard to tell him things her companions nodded discerning what she meant it was nice to be sitting here with the two people who knew her best remus and dorrie and not have to explain anything because they already understood she reflected on the brilliance of the circumstances that had connected her with dorrie almost three years ago nymphadora tonks had been living at home while pursuing her auror training and quite frankly her parents had been driving her mad she had desperately wanted to get a place but could not afford it on her meager salary as a part time barmaid her former headmaster had provided the solution arinna dunlevy the two women had gotten a flat which tonks still rented and tonks had tutored rinna in the ways of muggle living she had helped rinna find a job at the same pub she worked at it had turned out that rinna had a knack for bartending which tonks had laughingly attributed to rinna aptitude for potions fortunately tonks mother andromeda had been all for the arrangement as she had met rinna many years before on the arm of her dashing young cousin sirius andromeda was a shrewd judge of character and felt rinna might be a good influence on her daughter rinna and dorrie had hit it off well despite an eleven year age difference and became fast friends and later confidantes the arrangement probably could have gone on indefinitely but tonks had graduated to a full fledged auror and was making a decent salary finally and could afford her own place which had been a dream of hers rinna had become quite comfortable in the non magical world and felt confident she could live on her own she had harbored a longing for a cute little house for a while so the two went house shopping for rinna and that was that rinna had moved out a year ago but they kept in touch at least once a week and remained close friends rinna was pulled back to the present by the snapping of fingers in front of her face hey dunnie come back to earth tonks teased sorry was daydreaming for a minute there rinna grinned sheepishly remus leaned back in the booth and watched as the two girls playfully bickered he grinned dunnie and dorrie they called each other no one else was allowed to use those names they were he realized the two women he d ever felt the most comfortable around they each know my secret and accept me in spite of it he enjoyed the company of both of them he decided very much he determined he would forgive tonks her unwitting disruption of the agenda he d had for the day are you planning on finishing that he asked pointing to the remains of tonks lunch nah she said pushing it across the table to him you can have it rinna frowned i knew you were going to starve if you stayed at mundungus place she said darkly tonks grinned as remus responded escalating the conversation to a full scale wrangle they went at it like an old married couple she was awed to think their friendship spanned more than twenty years although she knew they d been apart for ten of those years she wondered why they just didntgive in to the inevitable and hook up tonks certainly found remus attractive and dunnie had confessed to having a schoolgirl crush on him in their days at hogwarts ah well maybe now that remus isntup north at hogwarts she would give her friend six months to get her act together and date the handsome professor if she didn t well then it is open season on a certain wolf for me listen dorrie rinna had turned to her would you like to join us for dinner tonight we have something we need to tell you wow that was fast tonks thought i have nothing planned so i d love to they paid the bill and left the pub all right then said remus offering an arm to each of them where to potion ingredients first then to a stationery store for duplicating parchment and i have got to find a birthday present for harry rinna said firmly did i tell you that i have been invited to his party remus asked her fantastic but were you invited to the pre party quidditch match rinna grinned you should come watch i sure it will be very entertaining the three turned and worked their way down the street arm in arm it was late when tonks emerged from her fireplace in the living room of her flat she stumbled clumsily to her room and flopped on her bed it had been a long and enjoyable day and the young metamorphmagus had been anticipating dinner with her friends the entire time much to her chagrin however there had not been any confessions of a torrid romance but instead the rather startling news that sirius was innocent and had been framed now that would take some getting used to she sighed and realized she probably wasntgoing to get much sleep tonight as she was going to be busy trying to wrap her head around all the implications of this news how it would affect her rinna remus the entire wizarding world that she was now pledged to protect and serve she sat up abruptly with a snap of her fingers of course i have connections a self satisfied smile began to take over her face she vowed she would certainly be using her spare time and resources in an all out effort to clear her cousin name hey remus was startled to find rinna at his elbow holding the now nearly empty bottle of wine from dinner hey yourself he was in a somber mood thinking of sirius and worried for his friend safety retelling the story had brought sirius to the front of his thoughts which in turn had made him very conflicted about his feelings for rinna he turned from the window he d been staring out of to her and noticed she had changed into a low cut blouse and tight skirt great she has to work tonight want to help me finish this off she asked there is enough for a few swallows for each of us and i have a little bit of time before i have to go to work my shift starts at eleven all right he agreed taking the bottle from her and taking a few sips from it she lightly slapped at his arm ewww i meant for you to drink from a glass you know he raised an eyebrow at her so you ve kissed me before on more than one occasion i might add spanning several decades i might add and you are squeamish about sharing a nearly depleted bottle of wine with me he handed the bottle to her with a challenging gleam in his eye and gestured for her to drink up i say that is so very unfair bringing up things i did as a silly little thirteen year old actually if i recall correctly it was your fourteenth birthday although i was under the impression it was your fifteenth at the time she pulled the bottle from her lips and smiled i had such a crush on you then he took the bottle from her again really he looked at her closely really her smile widened wish i had known that about twenty years ago he swigged the rest of the wine and handed the bottle to her she eyed the empty bottle in her hands of course she said teasingly you were much more of a gentleman back then i ll have you know he said in his most stately manner that i am still a gentleman is that so yes and i ll prove it she cocked her eyebrow and smirked go ahead then he raised a finger in a most professor like manner case in point you have been standing in front of me in that outfit looking dead sexy for nearly five minutes now and i have not yet ravaged you rinna threw her head back and laughed merrily point well taken she said with a saucy grin with yet being the operative word i presume it certainly could be he leered wickedly at her then his expression softened he took the bottle from her hands and set it on the coffee table and took her now empty hands in his look rinna i ve spent most of today hoping to get you alone so that we could talk about whether or not we should try to make a go of this don t he stopped taken aback dontwhat she looked at him seriously dontask me how i feel about us i am afraid to feel when i feel it hurts he took her in his arms and held her tightly it hurts except except what he whispered except when i with you when i am with you remus i almost feel like i might be all right again she wrapped her arms around him and sighed he held her close resting his chin on the top of her head hey he said eventually she pulled away from him a little and looked up at him a ghost of a smile on her face hey yourself he grinned at that then his face sobered i not going to rush you or anything i can be patient when i set my mind to it her smile still played at her lips really because that is a virtue that i ve never seemed to acquire i trying to be serious here rinna remy i dontwant to analyze or strategize or whatever i tired of analyzing everything every thought and emotion that pops into my head i dontwant to talk about it i dontwant to scrutinize it i just want what what is it you want he murmured the clock in the hallway bonged once half past ten she sighed i just want us to snog each other senseless until i have to go to work and revel in how good it feels remus lupin was not an idiot he pulled her back tightly in his arms and said in a most gentlemanly way your wish is my command my lady a n please head to the go button below and tell me what you thought of it i hoping to get one more chapter out before july 16 but after that i ll be tucked away reading hp and the half blood prince but then again so will everyone else and no one will be reading fan fiction anyway 11 a new definition of family chapter 8 romantic intuition disclaimer unfortunately i dontown any of jk rowling characters if i did then i d be typing this from my vacation home in cozumel and my cabana boy would be bringing me chilled drinks with little paper umbrellas in them shirtless sigh any characters you see here that you dontfind in her books well they are products of my fertile and fevered imagination a n i know i know i was a long time getting this up was it worth the wait well when you are done reading go to the review button and tell me harry sat up in his bed in ron room the first hints of dawn creeping from behind the curtains he d been roused from a vaguely disturbing dream that seemed to slip from his memory as soon as he woke he was filled with foreboding and rubbed absently at the scar on his forehead as he tried to orient himself then he heard what had originally woken him a tap tap tap at the window he got up and opened the curtains to the barely breaking day fumbling with the catch before opening the window hedwig flew in silently and landed on the footboard of harry bed he padded over to her and retrieved the letter from her outstretched leg how is he girl he whispered softly hedwig hooted serenely and started preening harry took this to mean all was well with sirius he opened the letter and read it dear harry arinna dunlevy is your godmother although why she has not revealed that fact to you i cannot fathom on my discovery last year that you had been placed with your aunt and uncle i had my doubts about where her loyalties lie as she was to be your guardian should anything happen to me per your parents wishes i wish i could tell you that you can trust her but i honestly cannot guess as to her motivation for coming back into your life after all these years at best i can say be careful and if you have any doubts or suspicions contact dumbledore or lupin i will be of course seeking out additional information about her and i will contact you as soon as i know anything more i suspect we will be seeing each other sooner than we expected take care of yourself sirius two hours later ron woke to find harry sitting on the window seat with his knees drawn up to his chin staring out the window in thought what up harry he queried harry held the letter out to him ron padded over to take it and sat down on the opposite end of the window seat to read it what he mean when he says i had my doubts about where her loyalties lie ron wondered dunno was harry lackluster reply and why would he think we canttrust her he was going to marry her or did marry her right dunno ron musings were interrupted by a gentle rapping at the boys bedroom door soft enough to not wake them had they been sleeping but loud enough for them to hear now ron moved quietly to the door and opened it to reveal hermione looking sleepy with wild hair everywhere oh so you are awake then i was hoping you were i couldntget back to sleep she glanced to harry in the window who was staring out on the now pink and orange sky despondently what going on with him she asked ron softly ron handed her the letter from sirius she looked at it curiously as she walked over to harry bed and sat on the edge to read absently patting hedwig as she passed when she was done she looked at ron she raised her eyebrows inquiringly jerking her head toward harry ron knew what she was asking is he all right he frowned and shook his head slightly giving a small shrug i not sure he wonttalk to me hermione nodded in comprehension got up from the bed and moved to sit with harry in the window all right harry she asked quietly but harry was not all right he had been stunned by sirius letter not by the suspicious tone not by all the things that were said or left unsaid but by the implication that sirius was coming back to england i suspect we will be seeing each other sooner than we expected he turned to hermione face full of self reproach he coming back here mione he risking himself and returning all because i wrote that wretched note asking for information about rinna he smacked his forehead with his hand i so stupid why did i write him he doesnthave any answers for me he been in azkaban all this time all i did was get him worried and thinking he had to come back to protect me and why because i was too impatient to wait for answers harry you dontknow for sure that sirius is coming back hermione started harry interrupted look at the last line he coming back why else would he say we will be seeing each other sooner than expected he pulled the letter from hermione hand his voice rising in pitch in his anxiety and look at this part it says he will be seeking out more information about her he going to be putting himself out there asking questions and jeopardizing his safety and the worst thing is it will be for nothing i already have gotten answers to my questions have you harry hermione asked sharply have you really gotten answers this brought harry up short and reined in his hysteria what do you mean mione i mean that she hasntreally given you many answers hermione began to tick off her points on her fingers she told you she was friends with your mum but hasnttold you anything about her really she let you discover she was your godmother in a roundabout way she hasnteven told you about her relationship with sirius harry and ron who had pulled up a chair to join them by the window were slightly taken aback by her vehemence dontyou think she would mention something as important as being the fianc e of your godfather she demanded well ron said thoughtfully sirius doesntmention it either hermione mouth snapped shut on what she was going to say next as her eyebrows moved closer together in puzzlement she pulled the letter from harry hands you re right harry took the letter back and scanned it again i didnteven notice that why wouldnthe tell me that you know he has a history with her hermione left the window seat to pace about the room in thought she turned to the boys and said a bit dramatically perhaps it is a checkered history with her and that why he hasntmentioned it ron chortled a checkered history really hermione have you been reading my mother romance novels where do you come up with something like that hermione eyes flashed and her cheeks reddened in anger she crossed her arms and glared at ron just because you have all the romantic intuition of a tree stump ron was actively hooting with laughter now and harry was smiling romantic intuition ron howled since when did nose in a book practical rational no nonsense hermione granger develop romantic intuition harry grabbed ron arm no no it a genetic thing all girls have romantic intuition chromosomes you see they can lie dormant for long periods of time but suddenly spring to life fine hermione snarled if you want to make fun of me fine but i not going to stay here and listen with a defiant toss of her hair she turned and stalked toward the door instantly the smile fled from harry face no wait hermione he jumped up and crossed the room to grab her arm just as she reached for the doorknob please dontgo he spun her around and looked at her earnestly we re sorry for poking fun arentwe ron ron managed to pull a reasonably convincing penitent face and nodded vigorously besides i really want to hear your checkered history theory harry said cajolingly while flashing his most winning smile at her hermione relented it was rather hard to stay mad at harry when he gave her the smile at full voltage oh all right as long as you two will stop being absolute prats about it canthelp it ron quipped it genetic we have those absolute prat chromosomes you know yeah harry agreed as he led hermione back to the window seat they re located right next to the belching and passing gas chromosomes hermione rolled her eyes and smiled honestly i dontknow why i put up with you two why it because we are the wittiest and most charming blokes you know declared ron puffing out his chest a bit oh yeah that the reason she retorted sarcastically she settled herself more comfortably in the window seat and looked up a pair each of green and blue eyes was trained on her radiating genuine interest in what she had to say as infuriating as those two could be it was moments like this that reminded her how good they were for her self esteem she loved it when they hung on her every word impressed and admiring c mon mione harry wheedled turning on the charming smile once again enlighten us on your checkered history theory yes o brilliant one impart your wisdom upon us ron bowed over her hand and kissed it dramatically oh yes those two really knew how to work her didntthey she picked up the letter and perused it well notice the hostile tone he only mentions her name once he questions her loyalty whether or not she can be trusted doesntsound like someone who is all lovey dovey over her now does it you re right it doesn t harry mused and it stands to reason hermione continued that he wouldntquestion her loyalty unless she had done something disloyal before harry squirmed uncomfortably ah come on mione that all just speculation besides he questioned her loyalty because i was placed with the dursleys and we all know why she didnttake me in so he wrong it not that she was disloyal it was because she was well hospitalized well i still say he doesntsound like someone who is in love with her i think they had a falling out and the relationship went bad mione how can you get that from one short letter ron wondered not just the letter look at what else we know again she began to tick off her points on her fingers he didntmention their relationship and she hasnteither she hid all the pictures of him like she didntwant to be reminded of him then why didntshe just remove the pictures harry asked hermione waved his words aside and he never asked you about her that night at hogwarts you or professor lupin it was ron turn to protest there was no time they were dealing with pettigrew and then lupin turned into a werewolf and then you were busy helping sirius escape not really any chance to say excuse me but would you happen to know about my wife fianc e whatever and i dontthink they ever were married by the way she continued on blithely ignoring ron hang on what make you say that questioned ron honestly ron it is so obvious she snapped why dontyou pretend we re idiots and spell it out for us suggested harry i donthave to pretend she muttered then she declared there are no wedding pictures in her album and her last name isnt black well maybe she didntchange her name some witches don t you know and maybe she put her wedding pictures in another album ron countered and maybe i right hermione voice increased in volume to override ron s dontyou think i could be right she turned to harry i dunno he pondered what you are saying does make sense but but what mate asked ron well it just seemed that when we were telling her about sirius and pettigrew and everything well she seemed to want to hear about him and she didntact like she was angry but more like she was sad you know oh said hermione taking this in harry was right she started to recalculate her assessment ron snapped his fingers suppose that he broke it off with her and she is still in love with him that would make sense then hermione and harry both stared at him mouths open what ron demanded maybe i do have more romantic intuition than a tree stump after all highly doubtful dear countered hermione patting ron on the shoulder patronizingly but that was some good deductive reasoning there may be hope for you yet gee thanks miss megabrain he snarked harry let out a huge sigh the truth is we have no idea about any of this stuff we re just going around in circles well we do know that sirius doesnthave any answers for harry about her hermione pointed out in fact we know more about her since the night that harry parents uh since that night than he does and we know that he coming back to england to find out more about her harry added hermione started to protest harry we dontknow for sure that sirius is coming back i know hermione harry interrupted with conviction i just know there was a long thoughtful pause then ron spoke if he is coming back then he is probably going to come here i think we should tell my folks about this i sure would hate for mum and dad to have a coronary when sirius shows up at our doorstep you re right ron said hermione quietly and it would be awful if someone acted first and asked questions later they both looked to harry i suppose you are right he said reluctantly he was worried about exposing sirius secret to too many people but if he was coming to the burrow i guess we should do it before your dad leaves for work then they all stood up and hermione and ron moved toward the door when it was opened the yummy smell of rashers of bacon being cooked up assailed their noses and three stomachs growled in unison and we can eat breakfast at the same time grinned ron happily as he left the room with hermione harry paused at his bed pulled out the green album and flipped to the pages with pictures of sirius and rinna they looked so happy like they were giddy in love he didntwant to believe hermione theories or ron for that matter he really wanted for them to still be in love he wanted the hope that they could be his godparents together that the three of them could be a family it was all he could think about since the charm had been taken off the pictures he closed the album and slowly turned toward the door rinna kicked off her high heeled shoes and changed into yoga pants and a t shirt she glanced at the clock a quarter to three she d only worked three and a half hours but she was tired from the day before that she had spent with remus and dorrie unfortunately she could not do what she wanted to do which was go to sleep and wake up around noon she had to reset her internal clock if she was to attend the festivities for harry birthday tomorrow so she planned on staying up now and not going to bed until this evening ugh the thought of a job with normal daytime hours was very tempting but she had promised remus she would talk to albus and she would keep her word since there was little else she could accomplish at three in the morning she took out parchment and began writing to dumbledore she heard the clock strike the hour about twenty five minutes later she felt she d written a small novel but was satisfied with her letter and she attached the curriculum vitae to the letter before shrinking both down to a more manageable size she d post it later in the day the hall clock struck once bringing her head up and snapping her into a pleasant memory of a very well spent 15 minutes with remus a few hours ago it was nice she reflected to kiss just for the sake of kissing with no ulterior motives granted their time had been limited so there wasntmuch chance to progress further but the last time she could remember when kissing had been the means to an end and not just foreplay was back in school with sirius her mind whispered to her well yes with sirius of course but there had been that time as remus had reminded her on her fourteenth birthday before she had ever thought of sirius as anything other than a self centered annoying git who thought he was god gift to women that time when she and remus had kissed for five wonderful minutes if she hadntbeen so na ve so inexperienced she would have realized the genuine chemistry they had had and things may have turned out a lot differently as it was it took snogging a few other boys to realize that the whole knee wobbling tummy turning getting all warm down there feeling was not a common one and by then it was too late to think about pursuing anything with remus sirius black had entered her stratosphere she shook her head with annoyance that was twice now in about as many minutes that sirius had snuck into her thoughts about remus she paused and that time when she woke up with remus in her bed last month he d popped into her head then and yesterday when they were walking to the pub her eyes swept the room and landed on the silver dart the memory it had brought to her mind a few nights ago had been so vivid she growled in vexation she used to be so good at blocking him out what happened you started opening your heart a little opening it to harry and to remus she stood stock still her boys she had locked them all away in her heart for different reasons all those years ago all three of them harry remus and sirius had been barricaded away so she wouldntfeel the pain of losing two of them and leaving the third she began pacing the living room in frustration so if she was carefully letting harry and remus out well it stood to reason that sirius would insist on barreling out too a specter of a smile tugged at her lips that was also very in character for sirius making sweeping entrances onto the stage in her mind and demanding she rip her thoughts away from remus and focus the spotlight on him once he had crossed the trajectory of her orbit back at school that was how things had been he d always made it impossible for her to entertain thoughts about any other bloke because suddenly he would be there captivating her his outrageous personality pulling her in like a magnet attracts a nail she ripped herself away from the memory so forcefully that she physically jerked her body and collided with the old trunk she had set on the ottoman causing it to tip over and fall with an exasperated sound she dropped to her knees and began picking up the items that had spilled old papers hair clips drawings quidditch wrist guards notebooks filled with old potions notes school books a muggle lp featuring that american boy that lily had been infatuated with oh what was his name oh yes david cassidy damn it why did she have to spill that trunk anyway she was trying to get away from memories not conjure up more of them she resolved to slam all the items back into the trunk as fast as she could pick them up and was doing an admirable job of it you still have those quidditch reflexes old girl you ll need them tomorrow when her hand fell upon an almost square velvet box rinna froze all the oxygen seemed to have been sucked from the room and her breath came in frantic gasps no no no why did i have to find this now of all times the box was the size of her outstretched hand and covered in black velvet she had no voluntary control of her hands as they moved to open the hinged top she had no voluntary control of the memory that flooded her mind rinna trembling hands opened the box inside nestled in the black velvet was a ruby pendant in the shape of a tear drop with three small diamonds at the bale she gasped it beautiful here let see how it looks on you sirius suggested as he unclasped the gold chain and walked around behind her he reached around her to place the necklace at her throat and she lifted her hair so he could close the clasp she turned around for him to see it twinkled on her fair skin like a drop of rich red wine did you know that the ruby has been prized throughout history as a talisman against evil here take a look he said as he turned her around and walked her to the mirror she gasped at the image and raised her hand to her throat to touch the gem her eyes found his in the mirror as he stood behind her with his hands resting lightly yet possessively on her shoulders oh blackie it so beautiful she breathed it is almost as gorgeous as you are he murmured in a low voice as he swept her hair aside to place a sensuous kiss on her neck i searched near and far for a beautiful ruby for my beautiful ruby the huskiness in his voice and the languorous kiss on her neck effectively removed the bones from her lower extremities and she swayed strong arms encircled her and his lips continued their magic why am i getting this now she wanted to know she caught his eyes in the mirror my birthday isntfor two more weeks he smiled his lop sided smile that had been designed for the sole purpose of making her light headed oh it not a birthday present what but you already gave me a christmas present canti give you a present for no particular reason not when it is as beautiful and i imagine expensive as this one no there has got to be a reason all right here my reason the other day and night for that matter was amazing he stopped at a loss for words a knowing smirk crossed her face ah so this is a thanks for finally letting me get in your knickers present then she said lightly a spasm of hurt crossed sirius face and he grabbed her shoulders roughly turning her to face him damn it rinna he grated out passionately dontmake it sound so cheap it meant much more to me than that he flexed his fingers shaking her slightly i cantever imagine being with anyone else but you again ever he let go of her and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration you are you re she stepped closer to him placing her fingers on his lips looking into his stormy sapphire eyes shhhh i sorry i sorry i was so flippant you know i would never treat your feelings for me lightly her arms slipped around his neck as she brought her lips close to his ear and whispered her throaty words i yours i dontwant to be anyone but yours once again his lips seared the column of her neck and once again her knees trembled at the sensation of his lips on her skin she raised her chin and sought his mouth with hers the intensity of his emotions blazed through her mingling with her own passion and returning to him through the force of their kiss if the world stopped right now it would be fine with her she wouldnteven notice all she was aware of was her man his lips his tongue his hands on her body and her bursting heart pulsing with fire he pulled away but only by inches and looked deeply into her eyes arinna dunlevy i love you and i love you sirius black she replied as tears trickled down to her upturned lips he pulled her in to his chest in a tight embrace and she snaked her arms around him just as tightly ah ruby red i could spend forever here in your arms he said hoarsely then why dontyou she whispered back she knelt in front of the ottoman sobs wracking her body as she pulled the necklace from the velvet and clasped it around her neck she wept for her loss as she had not done in all this time with plaintive whimpers and loud cries and shuddering gasps her release threatened to rip through her and she was concerned that she might not be able to stop the flood but she could not remove her hands from her face or stem the flow of tears finally it tapered off and she collapsed limply onto the ottoman resting her head on her arms spent she felt the red briolette as it hung at her throat bathed in her tears it was so monstrously unfair that she could still love him so after all these years and when there was little hope that he would ever forgive her or want her again a n love it hate it

please leave me your email address andi will thanks fingers of sunlight wove their way through the curtains and into the bedroom tracing a gentle caress across harry face he grimaced and squinted his eyes turning away from the brightness and rolling to his side hugging the second pillow having two pillows was a decadence he d never dreamt of when at the dursleys against his chest like a child with a teddy bear he smiled and hovered between wake and sleep for several minutes before two things registered in his mind the first was he had not been woken by some distressing half formed dream and the second was it my birthday his eyes shot open and he rolled onto his back with a huge smile on his face he was fourteen this was the first birthday where he wasntin a home that was completely indifferent to it here at the burrow not only would his birthday not be ignored but it would be acknowledged and even celebrated he practically wriggled with excitement he d never had a birthday party before laughter and delight bubbled up in him eclipsing all the worrisome thoughts that had been plaguing his mind the past few days the more mature fourteen year old part of him suggested deep in his mind that he was perhaps getting much too worked up over such a childish thing as a birthday party but the part of him that had seen all of dudley parties over the years quietly observing but never allowed to participate and had wistfully wished for a party of his own someday that little boy part of him kicked the cynical teenaged part of him in the imaginary shins and told him to shut it and let him enjoy his first real birthday ever damn it he was no more capable of staying in bed any longer than he was at reading tea leaves he had to share his excitement with someone he sat up and looked over at ron who was peacefully unaware that the day had dawned or that a large wet area of drool had darkened the pillowcase harry launched himself onto ron bed brandishing his pillow like a broadsword ron sat up with a start absorbing the full assault of the pillow with his face what the hell gerroff me you big hippogriff arse ron managed to grunt out before the next blow harry laughed wickedly and began a third swing but ron countered brilliantly blocking harry with his arm and seizing his own pillow to begin his defensive barrage it was ron turn to cackle when his wet drool drenched pillow connected soundly with the side of harry head knocking him sideways ewwww yelled harry who scooped up another pillow in his free hand but he found when he sat back up both pillows swinging that ron was similarly armed what had begun as an ambush was quickly evolving into a skirmish and then the door to the bedroom flew open with red and brown hair flying a pillow in each hand ginny and hermione descended on the boys and escalated the situation to a full scale battle the next few minutes consisted of ripostes and parries feints and advances where the soft feathery objects served as both weapon and shield until as was inevitable a tell tale rip was heard and the room was filled with downy feathers drifting down like new fallen snow molly found them coated in goose down and laughing hysterically she stood in the doorway in her dressing gown hands on her hips foot tapping ominously the room became suddenly quiet until molly impassive mouth began to twitch and try as she might she could not hold a straight face any longer her mouth quirked into a smile i see that the festivities have begun she drawled eyes twinkling foot still tapping four mouths began stammering out apologies but molly magnanimously waved them aside no no there no harm done and besides today is a special day she beamed at harry she pulled out her wand and muttered a quick reparo and the feathers began to fly back into the tattered pillow which then stitched itself up molly looked into four pairs of relieved eyes and said however since you lot have an obscene amount of excess energy this morning you will all follow me to the kitchen to help with breakfast the kids knew better than to groan and recognized the grace offered to them on any other day molly weasley would have been much less generous in doling out punishment for destruction of property actually this is a good thing ginny said quietly to the others because we can snitch samples before any one else gets to the table the boys brightened considerably at this and made a show of stampeding down the stairs trying to impede each other progress in order to get to the kitchen first hermione looked at ginny who grinned back they both rolled their eyes simultaneously and said in unison boys before making their way quickly down the stairs to the kitchen rinna jerked out of her sleep kicking off the covers and knocking the alarm to the ground she sat up on the edge ran her hands through her tousled hair and groaned the alarm had pulled her away from unsettling dreams most of which were quickly receding from her memory but the one she had been experiencing when the alarm went off however remained vivid behind her eyelids she is in remus embrace strong solid arms wrapped around her protecting her from pain from feelings she doesntneed to feel anything when she is with remus she senses that he will never ask her to feel anything for him and she is safe her fortress walls around her heart are not threatened by him she tilts her head up looks into his hazel eyes and he leans forward and presses his lips to hers she drowns in the kiss until he pulls away she opens her eyes in surprise at his retreat opens her eyes to his indigo blue ones blue eyes sirius with another groan rinna flopped backwards onto the bed she needed to pull herself together today was the day harry birthday and she needed her defenses in order damn it she did not need sirius sneaking in subconsciously shaving away at emotional masonry already weakened by the birthday boy himself and harry had weakened her strongholds she admitted to herself and was well on his way to breaching them without even realizing it she briefly considered backing out of going to the party but realized that would be unconscionable she would not deliberately hurt her godson she heaved herself off the bed and stumbled to the kitchen to brew herself some exceptionally strong tea to jumpstart her morning her fingers reached for the back of her neck kneading to release the tension there she was surprised to feel the chain around her neck she still was wearing the ruby necklace it was odd that she hadntnoticed it when sirius first gave it to her it took a week to get used to the feel of it around her neck she had been wearing it only twenty four hours and was so accustomed to its pressure that she d forgotten it was on her it was almost as if her body retained the memory of how it had felt all those years she d worn it she sighed this was not going to help her get over sirius she had realized that her feelings for him had not abated even after all the years they were stuffed away in the recesses of her heart and yet she knew that it was not logical to expect that anything could come of those feelings now sirius was long gone out of her life and quite likely was glad of it all things considered she simply needed to get over him now if she could just get her heart on the same page as her brain she glanced at the clock remus was meeting her soon she finished her tea and scones and went to change she stood in front of her vanity looking at the reflection of the necklace against her bare skin she reached up to take it off but stopped it really was quite beautiful and it would complement the summer dress she would change into for the party later and if she was honest with herself now that she had found it again she was loathe to part with it her contemplation was interrupted by the chime of her front door damn remus and his promptness she pulled on a u2 t shirt from the concert she and dorrie had gone to last year and a pair of cropped jeans and ran to get the door remus smiled and raised his eyebrows are you running late he asked her no she snapped you are just running annoyingly early he followed her down the hall and stood in the doorway of her room leaning against the door frame and adopting a look of long suffering patience do you have your gift and your clothes for the party what about your broom yes yes and yes i just have to get some trainers on for crying out loud you act like i haventeven gotten out of my pajamas yet he chuckled i ve obviously underestimated your ability to function before eleven in the morning i was expecting to have to drag you out of bed ha that just shows that you dontknow me as well as you think you do remus lupin remus grinned maybe i need to study the subject more he suggested roguishly rinna looked up at his mock innocent expression and felt her heart melt he was so sweet and charming and he was here she felt that flutter she remembered from school in her ribcage she was forced to admit she was once again harboring an earnest crush over remus rinna this is harry day you will focus on your godson you are going to put all thoughts of remus and sirius aside and not think about them any more today she looked in the mirror one last time noting that the necklace was now hidden under her t shirt she grabbed her bag with all her things and turned for the door the sight of him leaning against the doorway smiling impishly elevated her heart rate blast it remus was not going to make it easy to stop thinking about him not if he intended to look at her like that today she tried to get her thoughts and her pulse under control remus saw her expression change are you all right oh uh she stammered just a bit of nerves it been years since i played quidditch it was true she was feeling a little apprehensive about the upcoming match you ll be in good company though charlie weasley and harry potter are two of hogwarts best seekers he said reassuringly she scowled playfully at him where is your loyalty lupin what about james potter james was excellent to be sure but charlie was legendary and harry has established such a reputation in the three years he been playing that he will likely eclipse charlie legacy remy if you are trying to calm my nerves you are failing miserably you ll be fine you were an excellent player yourself right you do know that your use of the past tense isnthelping any dontyou she grimaced remus rolled his eyes what are you so afraid of what the worst thing that could happen you fall off your broom no the worst case scenario is that i play badly and make an ass out of myself hmmm playing badly is worse than severe bodily harm it nice to know you still have those skewed quidditch priorities dunlevy he said sarcastically rinna walked over to him and gently pinched his mouth together with her hand oh shut it you remus grabbed her hand and before she could react he turned her hand up and dropped a kiss into her palm whilst simultaneously wiggling his eyebrows suggestively she gasped slightly and leaned in toward him remus dropped her hand and cupped her cheek as their lips met in a languorous kiss when they broke apart she brought her hand to his cheek mirroring his position now there will be no more of that today mr lupin she said primly i not prepared for the full scale inquiry that will happen if molly weasley catches wind of any of this and i suspect you arenteither heavens no he pretended horror at the thought then he smirked at her i ll behave myself if you do i will be the picture of propriety she smirked back remus held out his arm to her shall we be off then she took his arm and beamed at him by all means yes blue eyes snapped open and his body sat bolt upright as sirius tried to wrench himself from a pleasant dream turned nightmare she pushes her long red hair out of her face and smiles up at him slipping her hand behind his neck and pulling him down to her waiting mouth her kiss scorches him leaving him with pain and longing as she pulls away she avoids his eyes and he growls in anger he grasps her roughly by the shoulders and turns her around to face away from him she screams and struggles in his grip he shoves her roughly away from him toward toward black eyes lit with unholy red black eyes that glitter in triumph as he shoves her toward the dark lord she screams no he panted as he swept sweat from his brow was it true had he pushed her toward no no no besides he refused to believe that rinna would have been allowed within ten kilometers of harry if she had turned coat all those years ago dumbledore or lupin would have made sure of it sirius wished he could contact lupin but without an owl it was impossible if he had been thinking straight the other day he would have had hedwig deliver a letter to him too as it was he had no idea where his friend was staying he had no idea where rinna was staying but he did know where harry was the weasleys he knew exactly where he was going he d been there many times all those years ago he pictured himself walking up to the weasleys front porch with flowers or candy in his hands rinna throwing herself into his arms with a girly squeal he shook his head to loosen the grip of the memory the dawn was breaking he d only had about two hours of sleep but he estimated he could make it to ottery st catchpole by early to mid afternoon if he pressed on he needed to get on the road he d lost track of the days but today was either the 30th or the 31st harry birthday he didnthave a present for his godson but he would make that up to him once he had found rin er once he made sure harry was safe rinna and remus walked up the steps to the front porch of the burrow and knocked at the door molly greeted them warmly and handed them each a tall glass of lemonade she gestured for them to follow her to the orchard several chaises had been set out in the clearing near the orchard affording a decent view of what would soon be occurring over the trees tables had been placed strategically laden with fruit and cookies and pitchers of lemonade bill charlie ron and harry were setting up the last hoop they waved to the newcomers and flew down to join the others in the clearing right said charlie looks like we re all here who playing eight hands shot up while the non players made their way to the chaises rinna moved over to stand near harry saying quietly happy birthday harry thanks he replied feeling a little awkward around her she could sense it i really glad to be here she said sincerely then her voice became playful but but what she smiled cheekily i should have my head examined on seeing harry eyebrows knit together in puzzlement she explained i must have been completely nutters to agree to play quidditch with all you young upstarts do you have any idea how long it has been since i ve sat on a broom the grin on harry face was pure impudence well actually i do it was a few nights ago i saw you rinna rolled her eyes i meant how long it has been since i ve been on a broom and played quidditch scamp she grinned back at him grateful that the tension between them had eased harry attempted to school his face to a more respectful look with minimal success then no i don t how long has it been long enough that i ll likely be very sore tomorrow they were interrupted by charlie i say are you two even listening harry and rinna snapped to attention under charlie glare then rinna glanced sideways at harry and raised her eyebrow conspiratorially he snickered but quickly put on a guileless face when charlie glanced sharply at them charlie was certainly taking his self appointed role of game captain seriously he continued how does this sound two games that last 45 minutes or until the snitch is caught with the option of a third match of thirty minutes if we re not all beat everyone nodded in agreement right then is everyone all right with playing any position we wonthave any beaters of course he glanced at fred and george with only four players on each team there was no need for beaters the twins groaned i suppose fred that we will have to debase ourselves and play the lowly position of seeker said george resignedly pointedly looking at charlie and harry fred heaved sigh of deep suffering i afraid so george or worse we ll be chasers he glanced at bill now dontstart a row about what is the best position to play bill advised you ll never get a consensus from this lot harry turned to rinna what position did you play at school rinna he asked curiously oh well i played all of them actually she saw puzzled expressions so she added i spent two years as an alternate before i made the team harry nodded alternate players of course served their team by filling in if a regular player could not practice or compete but they also served the important role of playing opposing team members during practice a good alternate could play any position and switched as needed during practice to help hone the team skills charlie had conjured sixteen chips eight charmed with each player name and four with each team colors and positions then he pulled out eight jerseys the teams are red vs green why do they have to be green asked harry as he picked up a dark green jersey with distaste it looks too slytherin bill and charlie glanced up at rinna who smiled slightly and shrugged tilting her head at harry he is the birthday boy after all she said let harry choose the team colors red vs blue harry said decisively the jerseys and chips changed from green to blue then the last thing we need to discuss is the rules crikey charlie protested george we re never going to play at this rate fortunately the rules for backyard quidditch were rather simple and the huddle to hash out the issues of penalties and other important details was short charlie requested that molly and remus officiate and they were each handed a whistle the chips were placed in bowls and molly chose the players names while remus chose the team chip team blue consisted of george as keeper rinna as seeker and harry and ron as chasers charlie was the keeper for team red and bill was the seeker leaving fred and ginny as chasers everyone kicked off the ground to hover above the orchard rinna flew up next to harry not too many of us playing our best positions are there she asked deviously harry glanced twice at her there was a very wicked smirk on her face just what is your best position anyway he asked in suspicion he did not get an answer for just then the balls were released and the game began had they charged several galleons for admittance the match would have been well worth it for sheer entertainment value alone the first fifteen minutes was a comedy of errors and at times it was all they could do to stay on their brooms everyone was laughing so hard then as everyone grew more comfortable the play got more serious as a whole the teams were pretty evenly matched although team red had the advantage of ginny playing in her element she was a natural chaser thirty five minutes into it the score was 60 40 to red advantage c mon harry roared to his team we can take em ha ginny taunted you cannot overcome the advantage of an all weasley team since the rules allowed for it with such small teams bill and rinna had been doing a fair bit of chasing during the match as the snitch had yet to make an appearance i hope the snitch shows up soon bill muttered to charlie there isntmuch time left to the match just then as if on cue a flicker of gold flashed in bill periphery he veered and took off rinna didnteven bother to search the sky she merely accelerated in bill direction once she saw where he was heading she ascended to a position above him and slightly to his right eyes roaming eagerly she did pay close attention to bill in case he was bluffing there a flash of gold to her left but bill was closer damn it had he seen it she banked sharply and sliced downward cutting bill off from the snitch he yelled indignantly and she merely cackled merrily as she swerved again hot on the trail of the golden ball she could feel that bill was close behind her hoping that bill would follow her misdirection she dropped into a steep descent when she was sure bill was following she slowed slightly and as he passed her she pulled up sharply rapidly ascending again it was a gamble had she lost the snitch once more the gold glint caught her eye and she zoomed toward it she heard bill shouting and cursing below her he d cottoned on to her ruse it seemed she had one last trick up her sleeve she flew at a level above the plane of the snitch flight hoping bill would think the snitch was above her since everyone knew it was far easier to reach up for it apparently the plan was working as bill was now above her and slightly behind she was so close just a few more feet and she would have it continuing her deception she reached up as she put on a burst of speed bill angled downward and closed the distance even though he could not see the snitch at the last moment rinna flung herself to the side one leg hooking on the broom as she reached downward and grabbed the snitch with a triumphant yell bill brushed by overhead and had she not been hanging under her broom by one hand and one leg she might have been knocked off bill circled her that was a dirty trick he shouted but he was grinning what were you going to do go through me to catch it she countered i was going to knock you away if you must know he retorted ah so that how you treat a lady she scolded as she swung herself back onto her broom rinna darling bill drawled as they began a lazy descent to the clearing in quidditch there are no ladies the two were mobbed as they landed rinna held up the snitch in victory as harry ron and george cheered what in the bloody name of quidditch was that fred asked rinna that my dear fred she said her manner pure braggadocio was what took my team out of third place and put it in the running for the house cup my seventh year harry grinned he d followed her every move anticipating what she was going to do and had been enthralled he d done similar bluffs many times but it was fun to watch someone else pull it off you played seeker then your final year i did for the last two matches after our seeker cracked his skull and went temporarily blind in one eye so you won the first of the two matches then ron said she nodded how d you do on the last one she grinned exultantly let just say we won the house cup the players took a quick break to drink lemonade and nibble on cookies remus sidled up to rinna and said quietly what the bloody hell was that all about miss pomposity i think you just out swaggered james and sirius combined he regretted his words when he saw her face fall a bit at the mention of sirius name she quickly recovered however that my friend was proving a point what point would that be exactly never underestimate the old folks she grimaced at him you re a funny man today arentyou i ll have you know i am like a fine wine i get better with age remus eyes twinkled uh huh he paused was it worth it proving your non existent point yes but remind me of that tomorrow when i groaning and i cantmove she chuckled ruefully the second match pitted harry ginny george and bill against ron rinna fred and charlie rinna and harry drew the keeper positions ginny and charlie were the seekers charlie grabbed the snitch about twenty five minutes into the game everyone up for one more short one charlie called no one wanted to say no even though everyone was hot and sweaty so the final lineup was drawn rinna and george were chasers fred the seeker and bill was the keeper for team red ron was keeper ginny and charlie were chasers and harry was the seeker for team blue fred groaned we donthave a chance against them with harry as their seeker he glanced hopefully at rinna wanna be seeker again rather not fred chaser was actually my favorite position i played it for two and a half years well i hope you are bloody brilliant at it because otherwise we are doomed fred pronounced gloomily the game was actually rather intense and the chasers for both teams were moving all over the keepers were forced to work hard as the quaffles were flung at the hoops practically non stop everyone knew it was the last match and they were giving it everything they had bill spotted the snitch and signaled to fred but harry had seen it too fred was no match for harry but he put forth valiant effort and made harry work hard to catch it everyone landed panting for breath their hot cheeks reddened with exertion they were hot sweaty and tired but pleased with the games harry thought he d never had so much fun he grinned as hermione ran up to him to hug him and laughed when she pulled back at the last minute ugh you re all sweaty she complained sorry does that mean i not huggable then she tilted her head and looked at him playfully oh you are always huggable i just choose to do it when you are cleaned up and smell nicer will i get a hug if i clean up mione asked ron with a wistful look on his face i suppose that will depend on how nice you smell too she retorted she turned back to harry that was so much fun yeah harry agreed your godmother is a good player ron commented as they followed the others back to the house to clean up and get ready for the rest of the party she was brilliant chasing in that last match harry grinned and she had everybody fooled in the first match that was a cunning move she pulled on bill well that was certainly the happiest i ve ever seen her look hermione said thoughtfully harry studied rinna back as she walked with bill and charlie and professor lupin they were laughing about something she certainly seemed happier and more playful than the other times he d seen her he liked seeing this side of his godmother he imagined that this is what she must have been like around his mother it took some time for everyone to get cleaned up and dressed for the festivities of course that was to be expected with eight people vying for two bathrooms what wasntexpected was the twins charming the upstairs shower to spew out maple syrup instead of water harry had been given the honor of getting first crack at the showers it being his birthday two seconds after turning on the spigot he realized he d been set up the last thing george and fred saw before locking themselves safely in their bedroom was an enraged fourteen year old wrapped in a towel dark hair plastered to his skull leaving sticky footprints in the hall as he charged at them green eyes snapping yelling you are so dead fortunately for harry the girls were using the bath downstairs in molly and arthur room and did not see him in his state of sticky undress once bill could stop laughing he set the shower to rights and scourgified the stairs and the hallway harry managed to get the syrup out of his hair hermione found harry in the living room alone which was unusual for this house he was looking out the window thoughtfully she thought he looked very nice in his jeans and button down shirt she moved close to him i hear you got yourself in a sticky situation up there she said with a laugh harry groaned at her pun it wasntmy doing i ll tell you that he turned and grinned wickedly at her so i just standing here plotting my sweet revenge it was hermione turn to groan i will not be pulled into a pun war mr potter why not afraid you d lose hermione tossed her hair oh please i would not lose i am a witty and intelligent person and i can make puns with the best of them harry mouth stretched into his charming grin as he said you ll get no argument from me there hermione felt herself flush under the intensity of harry smile well i uh i was looking for you to uh give me the hug you owe me he asked oh right she stepped up to him and put her arms around his neck happy birthday harry harry put his arms around her waist and hugged her tight resting his cheek against hers thanks mione she smelled like flowers and sunshine and she felt warm and comfortable against him she spoke into his shoulder you smell nice that was part of the deal wasntit i clean up and smell nice and i get a hug from my favorite girl he pulled away slightly and looked into her face his smile even wider than before he watched as her lips quirked upward and she blushed a little his stomach suddenly felt tingly he couldnttake his eyes off her mouth hermione felt harry heartbeat quicken at least she thought it was his but it could easily be hers she realized since she was feeling warm and giddy all of a sudden she felt herself leaning toward him unconsciously she saw his eyes widen harry head inclined towards hers as he locked his gaze on her brown eyes her eyes slid shut just a fraction of a second before their lips touched her mouth felt smooth and cushy and warm against his he thought his heart might punch through his chest they pulled apart and hermione for once in her life could not form a single coherent thought in her head she felt like she was filled with helium about to float away she opened her eyes to his brilliant green ones wow she breathed yeah wow harry agreed the sound of feet clomping down the stairs shattered the moment oy harry where are you mate came ron voice hermione and harry quickly stepped apart a second before ron came bounding into the room he grabbed harry by the elbow tugging him toward the door i have a fantastic idea on how to get back at fred and george now our chance but we ve got to hurry harry turned to smile apologetically at hermione she smiled back and watched ron pull him unceremoniously from the room her fingers drifted up to her lips and she stood deep in thought until she heard ginny call her name oh there you are ginny said did you find out find out what asked hermione confused what flavor ice cream harry wants ginny put her hands on her hips in a fair imitation of her mother honestly what have you been doing all this time oh uh i tried to ask him but ron came and grabbed him away hermione stammered ginny gave her a funny look before flouncing off muttering if you want something done right rinna stepped out of the weasleys master bedroom to find charlie and remus leaning in the hallway talking animatedly charlie saw her first and he stopped mid sentence lupin i think i seeing a vision he said dramatically remus turned and took her in and had to agree with charlie although she wasntwearing one of the sexy little numbers she wore to work she still looked fantastic in a sleeveless summer dress and heeled sandals hmm you clean up nicely dunlevy he said with a grin since he couldntsay what he really wanted to in front of charlie she stuck her tongue out at him then turned to charlie with a cheeky smile and asked are you always such a flirt charlie weasley charlie gave her a small bow yes ma am i afraid so it drop dead gorgeous women like you that bring it out in me she laughed catching remus scowl out of the corner of her eye i heading into the kitchen to see if molly needs any help would either of you louts care to join me she asked charlie looked positively alarmed uh i think i ll go see what kind of prank ron and harry cooked up to get back at the twins he said as he moved quickly for the stairs rinna looked at remus well care to lend a hand to kitchen work she asked pertly only because it means i ll get to be close to you he replied suavely her eyebrows rose goodness that was smooth have you been taking lessons from charlie i ll have you know he said haughtily that i was charming the ladies while charlie weasley was still wiping snot on his sleeves she reached up and patted his cheek you are adorable when you are delusional did you know she squealed as he lunged for her and scuttled out of the way making quickly for the kitchen across the house he caught up with her at the kitchen door and pinched her in the side as she stepped through she gave a squeak of surprise which caused molly to turn around would you like some help molly rinna asked color high in her cheeks molly appraised the two of them looking for all the world like teenagers on a lark i d probably better put both of you to work she said her stern tone belied by her twitching mouth you look like you will get into mischief otherwise she pointed to the plates and silverware you can start with setting the table please you are right to keep her occupied molly remus teased i sure you remember what a troublemaker she used to be molly pointed a wooden spoon at him her eyes twinkling detention for you professor for your cheek now get those glasses and set them out remus pretended to give wide berth to her spoon and moved to comply molly turned to rinna and looked her up and down rinna dear i remember that necklace it looks smashing with that dress like they were meant to be together molly smiled rinna hand went to her neck as her cheeks turned pink again remus looked across the table at rinna and studied the pendant closely he hadntreally even noticed it until molly pointed it out suddenly a memory blossomed in his head come on moony i need your help i dontknow the first thing about buying jewelry for a girl sirius pleading as he pulled remus into a small shop in hogsmeade oh yes he remembered being forced to accompany sirius that day obviously for the sole purpose of moral support since he wasntany more experienced at buying gems for girlfriends than sirius was he remembered sirius resolute search for the perfect ruby and how momentous the occasion felt sirius had revealed that he was sure she is the one it was that day that remus realized that sirius heart had been completely captured by a certain titian haired lass and remus had determined to never entertain any romantic notions of rinna again at the same moment that he felt guilt pierce his heart as he considered the more than platonic relationship that appeared to be budding between him and rinna a thought seared his mind why is she wearing that necklace again had anyone been standing outside the burrow when the word was given that dinner was ready they would have been convinced that a herd of wild animals was trapped inside the house and was stampeding the din of more than a dozen people moving toward the kitchen was so loud then the laughter broke loose as fred and george made their entrance dressed completely in magenta colored clothes all the way down to their trainers and socks and quite possibly their underwear but everyone was laughing too hard to ask no one needed to inquire as to how harry and ron prank turned out it was obviously quite successful even percy was chuckling after dinner the entire troupe filed into the living room for the opening of presents harry was given the natty wingback chair as the place of honor and was handed gifts lemonade and more gifts the room was full of laughter and good cheer and harry took a minute to bask in the feeling of being the center of it all this ranked right up there with catching his first snitch and how he felt each time he returned to hogwarts the gifts ranged from the extremely practical broomstick polish to the unexciting socks to the thoughtful a quidditch fact a day planner from hermione from professor lupin he received a book titled producing a patronus and other defensive magic by gerald laguardia rinna had also given him books one on the history and evolution of competition broomsticks and the other abercrombie to wronski the world top quidditch players of this century harry beamed as he thanked everyone after everyone had thumbed through the books and inspected and handled the various other gifts except perhaps the socks when the conversation had died to a low buzz molly suggested that everyone move back into the kitchen for cake and homemade ice cream she had finally obtained the necessary information to produce harry favorite flavor strawberry the kids settled at one end of the magically elongated table the adults at the other closest to the back door fourteen candles were lit on the cake for harry to blow out which he did to loud applause as everyone enjoyed the dessert the group broke up into little conversations while he was scraping the last of the delicious ice cream from his bowl harry caught the mention of his godfather name at the opposite end of the table and did his best to eavesdrop on the discussion so remus molly said the kids told us about what happened at the end of term it makes me furious to think that we harbored that that that sneaking traitor pettigrew all this time molly scowled one of her most terrifying scowls then her expression softened sirius is truly innocent then yes molly it true i saw pettigrew with my own eyes he faked everything and set sirius up to take the fall sirius is innocent molly turned to rinna with well this is good news she saw the look on rinna face a mixture of sadness guilt and regret isntit rinna didntanswer rinna rinna sighed well of course it good news molly it means that sirius isnta murderer she said unenthusiastically that not what i mean missy by this point ron and hermione had noticed that harry was listening to the adults and tuned their ears to the exchange as well rinna sighed again i know molly rinna was behaving unexpectedly but molly continued gamely on but if pettigrew is found and sirius name is cleared well then the two of you could it complicated molly rinna interrupted brusquely as she glanced at remus eyes full of emotion molly opened her mouth to respond and then closed it i see she watched as remus and rinna eyed each other and a small suspicion began to form in her mind she decided to test her theory this complication it wouldntbe a recent one now would it rinna pulled her gaze away from remus confirming in molly mind that they had been attempting some form of silent communication no i afraid it is something rather regrettable from a long time ago she said glumly molly felt the small bit of hope that rinna and sirius might finally find the happiness that had eluded them for so long start to dissolve is it repairable she asked softly rinna put her head in her hand and rubbed her temples to be honest molly i dontknow i doubt it she got up abruptly growing a little agitated at the uncomfortable situation she found herself in besides what is the point sirius is long gone hopefully well hidden and it is highly unlikely that i will see him anytime in the near future anyway of course molly would expect that rinna and sirius get back together as far as she knew there was no other man in rinna life and molly had no idea of the rift rinna had caused that she had damaged her relationship with sirius quite likely beyond repair the close proximity of so many people began to press in on rinna claustrophobically and she desperately needed some air and some space she turned and went out the kitchen door seeking the solace of the backyard the weight of molly expectations heavy on her heart it was sometime after three thirty in the afternoon when sirius trotted past the main street of ottery st catchpole and onto the lane to the burrow his footpads were sore and there were burrs in his coat he was tired but he was so close now he rounded a bend in the road and there it was looking exactly as he remembered it defying all the laws of magic and physics by staying upright now he would need to stay out of sight until he could catch harry alone he made his way to the backyard and positioned himself strategically in some bushes on a little rise by the side garden gate it afforded him a view of the back porch and the yard he tested the air with his heightened dog senses there was definitely a party going on he could smell all the cooking and the sweetness of freshly baked cake he felt his stomach rumble he settled his head on his paws and waited the back door opened and from his spot in the bushes sirius had an unobstructed view his eyes fell upon a woman with short red hair not weasley red but darker it wasntuntil she began to walk down the steps of the porch that he truly registered it was her rinna he would recognize that walk the sway of her hips and the way she carried herself anywhere after all he d seen it behind closed eyelids every day that he d been incarcerated his mouth went dry and he couldntseem to move he watched as a scene began to unfold remus had followed her out and was calling to her she was making her way to the side gate and to his consternation sirius noted that she looked distressed remus quickly took the steps and caught up with her about half way across the lawn he took her arm and spun her around speaking softly and soothingly to her with words too quiet for sirius to make out at that distance without thinking sirius slunk out of his hiding place and gravitated toward the garden gate like a moon drawn to its planet harry ron and hermione watched as rinna walked out the back door followed by professor lupin looks like we were right after all hermione whispered harry looked stricken i have to tell her that sirius is coming back he said in an undertone and got up to go out the door hermione and ron followed him and quickly shut the door behind them they saw rinna and lupin deep in quiet dialogue and harry was about to move off the porch to go to them when hermione dug her fingers into his elbow and pointed to the side gate the trio watched in stunned silence as a large black dog entered the garden and changed into a tall raggedy man oh no harry breathed rinna was surprised when remus stopped mid sentence his hand dropped from her arm and his eyes widened a look of stunned disbelief seized his face as he looked over her shoulder she felt goose bumps break out on her arms and the back of her neck prickled she slowly turned around a tall gaunt man stood not five feet away from her her eyes traveled up his body taking in the ragged clothes the too thin frame unkempt hair and beard he was a stranger then she reached his eyes stormy pools of cerulean blue swirling with emotions that she knew she did not want to name she sucked in her breath sharply sirius hullo rinna the silence between them was heavy and the air itself felt weighted with heartache and recrimination i didntknow if i d ever see you again a n ooh watch out for that cliff people and dontforget to review it will make me so happy here comes the shameless begging wouldntyou like to help me reach my goal of over 50 reviews before i get to chapter 10 i am so close to 50 17
