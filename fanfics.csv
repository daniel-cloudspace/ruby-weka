"by jedi tess and lee velviet summary draco ginny harry femaleblaise a rip in time and a bizarre collision with their own children brew a reluctant friendship between the foreverfeuding malfoys and potters well two of them anyway and two unlikely sidekicks anyway enjoy and kudos jt come off it potter do i look stupid enough to believe that rubbish hayden malfoy glared down at the seventh year in front of him tristan potter made a dramatic show of pushing her roundframed spectacles onto her head and squinting her bright green eyes at him hayden ground his teeth as several of the slytherin girls standing around behind her sniggered into their hands after a moment tristy lowered her glasses back onto her small nose and ran a hand through her long untidy black hair you want me answer that she asked at last quirking a dark eyebrow at him haydens upper lip curl tristy had always known just what to say to get under his skin  even when they were little kids it had been an unconscious knack of hers it was no wonder that hed eventually learnt to loathe her his hands fist at his sides as he fought the urge to wrap them around her scrawny neck she sneered at him egging him on oh malfoy kneazle got your tongue seems your only passable weapon since we all know you cant use your wand worth a damn her friends gasped as though they didnt hear her tear into people daily she rolled her eyes grabbed a fistful of his robes and frogmarched him out of earshot of her leering housemates thats right tris theres a broom cupboard at the other end of the hall weve still got ten minutes before double potions amber higgs called after them the other girls tittered tristy likes em best when they put up a bit of a fight malfoy hilary baddock added with a suggestive hitch of her penciledon eyebrow hayden saw tristys jaw tense other than that she gave no sign that she heard or cared what her housemates were saying leaning toward him so that she was speaking into his ear she whispered meet me outside snapes classroom before potions malfoy its really important and  look just be there right she turned away and stalked away with her entourage of friends hayden could only gaze after her suspiciously as she disappeared her long black hair drifting in a soft cloud behind her what was she playing at a large heavy hand clamped down on his shoulder but he continued to watch after tristy his frown deepening i hate to say it  again and again  but youve got it so bad for that girl a deep voice said from behind him haydens violent expression relaxed into one of mild annoyance are you mad i cant bloody stand her his lip curled at the idea dorian weasley stepped around in front of him and grinned down from his superior height he crossed his arms and flexed his arms raising his eyebrows hayden narrowed his eyes as he was forced to tilt his head back slightly to look up at dorian in their sixth year theyd both been lanky and the same height somehow during the summer before their seventh year dorian had shot up a full eight centimeters and with little or no effort developed several additional pounds of lean solid muscle come on mate dorian wheedled you know you want to shag her  i still say you take advantage of the summer hols and make the beast with two backs next time youre at uncle harrys manor dorian grinned even wider his blue eyes twinkling deep dimples appearing in his freckled cheeks reckon you just need to relieve the tension haydens eyebrows drew together in disgust no chance girls a bleeding nuisance that ratty hair  does she ever brush it looks like a bloody sheep and those specs make her look like an absolute prat but dorian was only shaking his head red fringe falling into his dancing eyes give over cant you see the two of you together thatd be a lark  a slytherin and a gryffindor hooking up dont reckon its happened since your parents got together yeah and clearly house rivalry hasnt exactly been affected by the power of love has it dorian grinned again real shame too amber higgs mate what an eyeful right  sorry to tear you away from your favorite subject his friend chortled ignoring haydens deepening scowl he went on like i was saying tristys got every bloke in this school drooling in his pudding even with those specs and the mad scientist hair shes definitely shaggable hell i even broke down and gave her my best shot over christmas when she and uncle harry came to the hollow his eyes glazed over even as his best friends eyes widened in horror caught her on the stairs and snogged her like crazy you know she actually blushed i bet you anything shes still a virgin yeah  pure as driven snow hayden muttered feeling a little ill especially with all those pro quidditch players around the manor when her daddys not home go on mate  youve seen the leather she swans round in dorian wasnt listening his eyes were still far away and he was looking rather rueful never in my life have i had a girl tell me my kiss felt brotherly hayden made a sound of revulsion "

around her and before she could yelp for help shed been yanked backwards onto the bed charlie bills lazy interjection made charlie pause in midsmother giving nancy just enough time to fight her way

she could considering she was smushed under charlie and half of a pillow since i cant breathe i dont see how i can misbehave she muttered charlie grinned down at her and her heart did a somersault in her chest she still couldnt believe that hed forgiven her so quickly not she reminded herself that she had done anything so wrong it was just that things had been so strained so uncomfortable for what

"disclaimer all  harry potter characters and story affiliations mentioned in this fan fiction  all belong to jk rowling and legal associations i own nothing of it nor am i  profiting from it now and planning too in the future in any way the only  exception of profit is to my self for literary improvement author to reader  note this chapter is only to introduce the plot and mention harrys leaving of  the dursleys the following chapters will dwell further let me also ask that  any and all readers please remember that when i started this story in october   it was only based on the first four books along with my perceptions  of the characters at that time so while reading most definitely there will be  a large difference between this and oop a few things in this story are  elements that i generated from my imagination and are not based directly in the  four books just something i wanted ill warn you now that i am an hhr  shipper i do hope any and  all readers do enjoy this story created  revised  harry potter and the  turmoil within the turmoil begins the walls stood high covered  in patched moss of green filth glossed by moisture no human dare touch a thick  putrid fog smelling of rotten things wafted about the air darkness consumed  nearly all that could have been seen for the small amount light made available  from an unseen moon revealed only a few feet of the corridor harry was in a  maze one even worse than at the tournament his tattered robes and school  dressing did nothing to defend against the icy cold that enveloped him the  worst of it all was that his wand was gone and where it was he did not know or  even how he lost it a multitude of muffled sounds  came in every direction around harry except for one it could be distinctly  heard from somewhere high above a shrilled banshee like laughter of claws  scraping chalkboards harry moved slowly through  the freezing labyrinth with no progress that he could sense a sound of wind whistled  behind him and harry swore there was a whispering voice calling his names the wind whistled louder  again and this time he heard it harry rushed as fast as he  could through the corridors but the calling whisper only came closer and  louder in the whistling winds harry tripped on landed hard  on the gravel ground he tried to stand but his body was giving into the  numbness of cold he looked ahead only to regret it eyes stared back at him  floating in the darkness with no face to claim them and no body to give  recognition to they just seemed to float there these eyes were glowing red  as blood and ablaze in furious fire yet cold as the depths of the icy maze harry looked upon these eyes  and a familiarity came to him the eyes began to glide slowly towards him as  the whispering voice grew ever more loudly and nearer the eyes came within a  moments distance from him and the voice called again yelling and with that harry opened  his eyes and sat up quickly gasping for breath he surveyed his bedroom in  blurred vision yet another nightmare had  come to pass the nightmares continued as  they had since the beginning when his fourth year had ended and summer holidays  began almost night after night the  nightmares played their demented show in harrys unwilling mind giving only a  night or twos retreat since the beginning of the holiday the nightmares had  grown steadily in intensity from just the foul smelling maze to the muffled  sounds evolving to the whispered voice and now cold eyes of blood filled hate harry cursed as he sat there  feeling the cold sensation in his scar which was worsened by the immense cold  sweat upon his brow that always accumulated during the nearly nightly replays  of depravity sometimes he would wake up  from these dreams in the early morning hours and just lay there awake unable  to consider the concept of sleep which his body reciprocated in disagreement  hed lay there in silence broken only by hedwigs return home from a nights  hunt with a hoot gesturing a full stomach and a need for rest there were  sounds from the few nocturnal creatures of night like crickets finishing their  time while early birds woke to begin the daily foraging harry lay there while  the world continued on its schedule and he could not follow as others did  magic or muggle alike harry sighed deeply to  himself as he stared at the ceiling still able to picture those demonic eyes  which now began to haunt his dreams nearing the end of the holidays the summer holidays this holiday had been quite  different than the last three had been or any for that matter after having  been returned to pivet drive the dursleys view of harry had not changed at  all they still prevented him from leaving the house most of the time they  still regarded him as abnormal with no value above garbage aunt petunia still  barraged harry with numerous chores and garden work dudley still got whatever  he wanted yet life at privet drive was  a bit different than the normal way it had followed in previous t"

"an as some of you know i completely screwed up and accidently replaced this chapter so now ive put it back to how it should be i probably should have used that chance to edit it a little but oh well it was the first day back at hogwarts everyone was filing into the great hall for the sorting i wonder who theyve got for us for dada this year ron said as they made their way for the gryffindor table i hope its a female hermione said so far all of our dada teachers have been male i dont really care as long as he or she doesnt work for voldemort and nothings wrong with them harry said craning his neck trying to see their new teacher your neck wont hurt so much afterwards if you wait until we sit down to look hermione told him harry sheepishly stopped looking up at the high table when they finally reached the gryffindor table they sat down harry and ron on one side with hermione across from them right after they sat down the twins sat by ron who groaned and looked away from them his gaze fell uponthe high table where he saw the new dada teacher his mouth dropped open shaylee what harry and hermione looked up occupating the dada professors spot was a tall redheaded girl with freckleswith her hat on lopsided while his two friends looked at him bewildered ron was getting fred george and ginny who had just sat down by hermione to look up at the high table fred and georges mouths also dropped open and a mischievous look came into their eyes ginny squealed and jumped up to wave the new professor laughed and waved back winking at fred and george who grinned and gave each other high fives erm harry and hermione looked to rom for an explanation he opened his mouth to explain but he was interrupted by mcgonagall coming in the first years behind her the first yearsall stared at the hat confused and jumped when it broke into a song perhaps the greatest known slytherin the choosiest of them all always liked them like his own ravenclaw the wisest one chose cleverness and sport while hufflepuff the kind old chap the workers were hers to sort and last there is gryffindor but certainly not the least his bravery and boldness made sure he was no beast these four brilliant wizards put me in charge for i can see your thoughts even hidden far so put me on that head of yours and we shall see which of the four you are most like and put you there bless me everyoneapplauded and the sorting began they listened vaguely and clapped when someone was sorted into gryffindor finally after all of the first years had been sorted mcgonagall took her seat harry and hermione once again looked to ron but before he could say anything dumbledore stood ron rolled his eyes and sat back for the wait before we begin i have two announcements im sure many of you have noticed the newcomer in our staff dumbledores eyes twinkled as he looked at the gaggle of weasleys at the gryffindor table it is my pleasure to introduce to you our new defense against the dark arts teacher professor shaylee weasley her name got tremendous applause most of it coming from the gryffindors fred and georges whistling probably won that competition shes my cousin the only young girl in the family besides ginny and fred and georges third stooge ron took the time to explain to harry and hermione after the applause dumbledore spoke again it seems that youve been accepted professor shaylee grinned a grin identical to the twins i see the resemblance hermione whispered dumbledore continued many of you might have realized that you havent received your timetables yet he smiled at hermione she blushed she had in fact been wondering that very thing earlier this is part of my second announcement you have not received them yet because there is a new course being added for all years a groan rippled through the great hall dumbledore smiled yes yes but you havent heard me out yet he waited until there was silence in a recent study about muggle education it was found out that to keep their students in shape they require a physical education class be taken that study also reports that four out of five young wizards in europe are out of shape american wizarding schools are already requiring this course so naturally we studied a little more into the matter weve added a gymnasium to the th floor so in short your new course is physical education there werent any groans but nobody was exactly thrilled either dumbledore laughed again and continued normally there would be separate classes for boys and girls but at the lack of a male teacher willing to risk his life doing athletic activities with some certain th year boys his eyes twinkled as he pointedly looked at the twins weve persuaded instead professor weasley to handle the classes by years this got dumbledore the response hes been waiting for applause he smiled and said i only have one more thing to say tuck in he waved his wand and food appeared on the tables finally im starving ron exclaimed stuffing a chicken leg in his mouth im not harry said filling"
"coming soon a very depressed sirius reflects on his situation in azkaban  an hello lovely readers this was meant to be the last chapter i think you should know but thanks to a few ideas from reviewers my cousin and my muses i came up with a smashing idea for chapter  so we shall crack on with this story more to come soon i promise keep the reviews coming please i love them all so much and i love all you so much thank you blows kisses an sorry this had to be the end thanks to everyone who stuck around for so long  i was sapped for ideas so this was as far as i could get took nearly a whole year out of my life this story did it was well worth it i think i finally tackled a long serious story as opposed to my short silly stories im in the process of writing another serious romance  its not harry potter but i promise itll be sweet  year   college housework and other challenges to be continued coming soon  year  the third posthogwarts year sadly all the treason and lies and deaths and all the other unlovely things we dont want to hear about will happen in this chapter suspicion worms its way into sirius and remus relationship and snapey becomes even stranger and more mysterious but on the happier side james and lily become parents and sirius becomes a godfather "

"i almost think that there is a greater war  here at hogwarts than in the rest of the wizarding  world dumbledore commented sighing he watched as mcgonagall  approached looking grave albus we have a  situation he  chuckled but she narrowed her eyes and he looked at her seriously it isnt  only your house minerva the whole of hogwarts is split only slytherin is  still together and they stick to themselves anyway what good do they think can come out of  separating my house isnt gryffindor at all anymore only  the cavillors and auscultos its the same in hufflepuff  and ravenclaw dont think its your fault they  dont agree on the voldemort issues for the most part although you know there  are other things as well and they dont know how to deal with it so  naturally they refuse to speak to each other anymore naturally this  isnt natural its absurd dumbledore  smiled to himself lead the way minerva well see about this situation  shall we the corridor outside the gryffindor common  room appeared to be filled with a mob as they came closer they saw the whole  gryffindor house split into two and on opposite sides facing each other with  scowls in the middle of the two sides were james  potter a cavillor and lily evans an ausculto the newly  appointed heads we cant have a cavillor as head boy a  boy from behind lily yelled at  the same time someone from james group announced i say james get rid of  this one lily and james were in the middle of a  heated argument with each other and neither of them appeared to be winning oh  and i suppose that you think i like the idea dumbledore cleared his throat loudly the  students stopped shouting and looked sheepish there will be no change in  heads and no protesting he said slowly so that they heard every bit of it  you are obliged to work together mr potter and ms evans and dont even  consider the fact that youre not of the same group the rest of you will also  cooperate with each other as far as i am concerned there is only one group  now and there always was he walked away mcgonagall  added this has gone on too long and she was gone as well the  cavillors and auscultos glared at each other for a  long time before shoving their way through the portrait hole and proceeding to  gather at opposite sides of the common room neither group acknowledged the  fact that they were sharing a room with some of their worst enemies sure at first they had started out as merely  debating sides mostly about how to handle voldemort and bring him out of power  but now they were oh so much more now they were their own houses in a way  only they were studentcreated and that made them more powerful you alright lils kristen asked brushing dirty blond hair out  of her face lily  scowled and then sighed im not angry at you you know that but the whole  thing makes me angry im almost ready to go to dumbledore and tell him that i  refuse to work with a cavillor so do it selene joined in go tell  him lily  smiled and turned to her other friend and you should know that id never do  that she thought for a moment but you would lily  sighed it was a long shot anyway she glanced around at the five beds in the  room there had been two other girls living with them in first year but when  the groups or associations were formed they ended up being cavillors it was  no longer boys to the left and girls to the right now it was cavillors to the  left and auscultos to the right she didnt know about the cavillors but  her group still had dignity the guys slept together farther up into the tower  than the girls their dorm was the only one with any empty beds at all i think ill go walk around lily said  rubbing her temple i need to think about all of this want us to come kristen asked  selene nodded too her hazel eyes watching  with interest no no ill catch you guys later she  left the dorm before they came up with reasons for them to come with her she  wouldnt get anything done that way without knowing where she was going or  why she descended the curving stairs to the gryffindor common room it was a  shame that they still had only one common room what about the ravenclaw and hufflepuff auscultos they were more associated with her than these  other gryffindors she found it empty of students first  night back so as usual everyone was upstairs getting situated she sighed and  dropped herself down in front of the roaring fire i shouldnt even be talking to you now  she heard a voice hiss from behind it was obvious who it was she closed her  eyes attempting to force it into a dream it wasnt working what are you doing here potter he  scowled at her i have as much right as you do more  ive already appealed to dumbledore and he wont do anything about  thissituation i hate it as much as you do but hes up to something hes not  going to change his mind as he spoke lily watched his dark hair fall into  his aqua eyes and all over the place she closed the door to her dorm behind her  and looked up at her friends who were sitting on one "

"not tonight though tonight the students sat in their own cars not frequently crossing the threshold into others the only sound came from the movement of the train the quiet talking of the students and the rain even under normal circumstances there would have been a definite decline in the pranks pulled due to the absence of the weasley twins both of whom had graduated from hogwarts last year had they been there they would have been grandly disappointed at the fact that no one even thought of playing pranks that night happiness seemed to be long abandoned and the feeling hovering in the air was a melancholy one in one car near the back of the train three students were seated one was a fifteenyearold girl who sat curled up on a seat of her own a schoolbook propped open in front of her as she munched on a cauldron cake two others boys of the same age sat across from her one of the boys was polishing a broomstick while the other stared out the train window into the dark black beyond though all of them kept up their facades of normalcy it was apparent that their hearts were not in it harry potter sat down his firebolt on the floor and its movement blended with the trains vibrating in an unsteady manner he tucked away the polishing kit and looked up neither of his friends had moved hermione granger was still staring determinedly at her book which would normally have been quite an average sight however harry had been watching her and the normally fast reader had been staring blankly at the same page for fifteen minutes her eyes unmoving he looked over at ron weasley ron noticed his friends gaze and met harrys eyes he was expressionless and when he spoke breaking the silence for the first time in over an hour his voice was just as toneless as his face had been time to change into our school robes i reckon we should almost be there by now no one moved though hermione did look up apparently confused harry and ron had no doubt shed been lost in her thoughts until ron had spoken harry scowled this is rather ridiculous guys we havent seen or spoken to each other for an entire summer and now im wondering if were going to talk at all during the school year either hermione looked a bit shocked but harry you cant tell us you arent scared you of all people    im not happy harry said in a distant voice but im not terrified either the fact is this is what he wants terror mayhem disruption were giving it to him if we cant fight him mentally we certainly cant do it physically ron remained quiet and looked back out the window hermione and harry exchanged knowing glances of sympathy for their friend voldemort was back hed returned to full strength the year before at the final event of the triwizard tournament harry had witnessed it it was not until recently that voldemort had acted though but he hit hard when he finally did one week before there had been a ministry conference in eastern england the point of which was to discuss the impending threat of voldemorts return death eaters had swarmed the conference about halfway through the final death toll was thirtytwomen and women from all different departments of the ministry cornelius fudge had been present but had amazingly managed to escape the destruction and horror along with twentyseven others rons brother percy had attended the conference and had not been so lucky throughout his years at hogwarts ron had always made sure all of gryffindor knew he hated his brother hed frequently described his older sibling as annoying egotistical powerhungry arrogant and a disciplinarian hed always supportedeven helpedfred and george when they bewitched his prefect and head boy badges or when they played pranks on him he never missed a chance to put percy down but in spite of that he had always loved his brother losing percy had torn him apart inside and had done the same to his entire family ron wasnt letting his pain show to his friendsor so he thought despite his illusion of normalcy his grief showed in his distant stares his silence and his refusal to eat anything so far harry and hermione had been careful not to say anything to him the whole of hogwarts was frightened by this recent act of terror many that now attended hogwarts had not been alive during voldemorts first reign and none had they even been born were old enough to remember this was all new and terrifying to them the only ones who had any idea of the type of terror voldemort could inspire were harry hermione ron and ginny in an effort to escape the depressing anguished feeling that had come over them hermione stood she picked up her hogwarts robe and slipped into it she had already been wearing the typical gray uniform so that this was all she had to do aside from putting on the tie which she decided to do later just as she was shrugging into the redlined black robe that proudly bore the gryffindor lion she heard the door slide open behind her she was startled as the only people to stop by all day had been ginny and the snack "
"an everything belongs to jk rowling bloomsbury scholastic and warner bros only thing that belongs to me is the new characters and plot but if jk wants them she can have them too please dont sue me chapter  harry looked outside of his bedroom window and was thinking about how only two weeks ago he had seen cedric die right in front of him and the dark lord had come back to power the most

aunt petunia was yelling at harry to come down stairs for breakfast harry went down stairs to see what was going on when he saw all kinds of presents everywhere and remembered how it was dudleys th birthday just cook the breakfast and dont burn it aunt petunia screeched at him yes maam harry responded deadly ever since dumbledore sent a letter to the dursleys about how harry almost died and was just barely saved the dursleys were even if possible more rude to him how disappointed they were to know that he had survived and wasnt dead harry said deadly again yes sir after dudley opened up all  of his presents he was getting very mad because he had  last year and he was suppose to have more that  aunt petunia could sense a tantrum coming on so she got his attention right away dudley looked at the package weirdly but shrugged his shoulders and opened it dudley pulled out three plane tickets to hawaii and right then and there all of harrys hopes went away oh dudleykinns it isnt crap no no

hermione had been right harry shouldnt have to"
"usual disclaimer all the characters well almost all of them are property of jk rowling and im merely borrowing her brilliance and her world with no claim to it at all id like to thank the harry potter lexicon in particular since theyre help in filling in the holes of ms rowlings world has been invaluable to making this story as authentic as possible please look them up sometime as for why i chose to focus on the lily and james era of things well the characters arent so deeply established for the most part that i have to worry about stepping over ms rowlings toes and perverting her thoughtful creations beyond necessity i hope you enjoy and reviews are always appreciated lily evans roamed diagon alley listlessly she was alone although she had seen and spoken to a few other hogwarts students in passing and weighed down by a few bags already lily was saving her heavier shopping for later so as not to burden herself anymore than she had already managed to content to wander into shop after shop exploring their wares she committed herself to getting a sundae at florean fortescues ice cream parlor at some point during the day  although she wasnt uncomfortable with it lily was growing slightly bored being alone with only her thoughts her older sister petunia had made such a fuss about all the attention lily was getting she demanded her own quality time with their parents they offered to take her along to diagon alley since she had never been there but petunia insisted buying lilys freakish school supplies wasnt her idea of a holiday petunias moping and pouting had eventually wore on all the evans and lily feeling a little guilty over her sisters jealousy and hostility told her parents she was more than able to get all her things for hogwarts on her own the evans dropped lily off in front of the leaky cauldron at ten that morning promising to retrieve her at six that evening that was more than enough time for lily to have a leisurely afternoon in diagon alley and gradually become bored out of her mind finding herself lingering outside quality quidditch supplies lily shrugged to herself and decided to go in passing the pack of young wizard children gawking at whatever topoftheline broom was on display in the window lily figured her stay within the shop would be relatively brief since her only interest for quidditch was infrequent at best aside from her support of the gryffindor house team lily didnt keep up much with quidditch on large she figured it was largely attributed to her not finding the energy to follow along with muggle sports let alone ones only found in the wizarding world  still she always had a good time watching the house matches and wouldnt mind seeing a professional match sometime as quidditch was easily the most exciting sport invented lily stepped into the shop just as james potter stepped out colliding gently into one another the contents of their bags rustled lily would be lying if she said she were surprised to find him there he was the chaser captain and all around star player of their house quidditch team  hell it wouldnt have surprised her if she found out james potter was living out of the back of quality quidditch supplies james face lit up when he saw lily as he almost selfconsciously if lily didnt know for a fact james had all the confidence in the world readjusted his circular spectacles and ran a hand through his black mess of hair that wouldnt lay flat if it was charmed to lily sighed a little it wasnt that she disliked james they were both gryffindors and ran in pretty much the same social circles but james was something of a goofoff in spite of his potent magical skill and relation to a respectable wizarding family he was cocky brash and sometimes even a prat but james was irredeemably gallant and had a charm to him that made it hard to utterly dislike him oh im sorry james lily apologized casually since no one had been hurt and nothing had been broken james bowed jokingly fancy meeting you her miss evans james was failing miserably as he attempted to maintain his stiff pretense showing that formality didnt suit him well got wind that youre our new house killjoy ill assume you meant prefect lily said dryly but cracked a smile she knew james was only teasing and she expected no less from him now as they were about to enter their th year at hogwarts yes well you only got the position because i didnt want it james insisted with a grin twitching over his lips lily knew he had meant this as a joke but considering everyone had james pegged on the fasttrack to becoming headboy she had no doubt that if he had bothered to apply himself to following at least a fraction of the school rules hed be wearing the prefect badge instead of her i can see how it would be a conflict of interests youd have to subtract points from gryffindor every time you come up with something new and deviant to slip under the noses of the faculty lily solemnly nodded  wed be in the negatives every time you had a brain st"

"hey mr and mrs potter sirius greeted walking in the back door you never knock anymore do you sirius scott potter stated with a chuckle sitting at the kitchen table reading a newspaper no need to he practically lives here caroline potter said laughing fixing lunch for both herself and her husband hey this was my home once sirius said laughing sirius mother the only parent he was living with had kicked him out while he was sixteen and the potters took him in for the next three years until he moved out to live in a simple nonexpensive tiny but cozy home in alphamstone he lived there with his roommate lily evans who was actually dating james potter at the time lily and james been dating for about seven yearsoff and oncome june  and they only just got serious about a year earlier james attends london university for dark art magic studying to be an auror on a quidditch scholarship james was in his third year of college at age twentyone i think we still have potato chip bags and soda cans lying around from when you lived here mrs potter said laughing is james around sirius asked cracking a smile sorry sirius i think he went to diagon alley with remus mrs potter answered remus lupin was another good friend of theirs who was a sea trainer working with sea monsters at sea county right on juniper lake a lake full of sea monsters and other magical sea creatures yeah about a half hour ago to say a short hello and a goodbye remus is leaving for argentina on tuesday and hes pretty busy packing up and hes having dinner with peter or lily or someone tomorrow so they both thought that it was best to just go now mr potter explained remus is going to argentina on a business trip nothing out of the ordinary and they didnt even think to invite me sirius said pretending to be hurt werent you the one who made the waitress cry at the last restaurant you were at mr potter said with a goofy grin here take two brownies mrs potter offered i dont know sirius trailed off sirius black are you turning down food mr potter asked no im just not sure if two will be enough sirius said grabbing a few brownies all three of them laughed as sirius left the kitchen and apparated to diagon alley he found remus and james sitting in a booth at the fruitfly one of their favorite restaurants laughing and talking sirius james cried jumping out of his seat and running towards sirius to give him a huge hug its been too long prongs my man sirius cried hey it isnt my fault ive been busy with so much paperwork and research projects for the past four months that i really havent had much time to visit hey youre the only one of us who is attending university sirius pointed out not true savannah goes to college james pointed out well i meant out of peter remus you and me sirius explained god i havent seen savannah since the labor day picnic last year yeah remember she was visiting relatives on christmas this year so she left christmas eve night and i had the winter break work project so i flew in on christmas morning we just missed each other the last time i saw her was on valentines day briefly when she came by to talk to lily when she was at peters and my apartment remus explained she hasnt changed at all still young and still beautiful they all laughed savannah turner was lilys best friend and a good friend to the rest of them she was tall thin and beyond gorgeous she was about  and thinner than she should have been with long shimmering honeyblonde hair and stunning baby blue eyes a sparkle of mystery hiding behind them she attends montreal arts university for witchcraft and wizardry in canada so they never really got to see her much unless she had enough time to take a weekend off and if she did visit it was only for a few days considering

teacher that he shared his teaching hours with so he only worked in mostly the mornings except for mondays in which he works fulltime in return for professor randy dalton working on saturdays for hall duty unfortunately for himor maybe it was fortunateall the girls in the school were practically in love with him which made it all the much harder to teach professor dalton was probably sixty years old hard of hearing and balding im going up to the ministry offices to work with head auror sir ardamis sephilia on some auror work he wants me to look at tomorrow james explained thats great remus cried i hope so i dont want to get my hopes up but sir"
"hey all this is kalariona this is my first attempt at a harry potter fanfic i have been reading them for god knows how long and i felt that it was about time i wrote one inspirations come from aja ivy blossom and frances potter for their wonderful stories that got me hooked well i hope this is the start of a rather lengthy story and i hope it differs from any others ive had an idea in mind for a long time and it took me a while to put it to paper i need help how do you go about getting a beta reader i would love one and i would actually be able to update quicker well at the start this will be a pg but will progress into an r if i can do the romance scenes right ive always had a failing with romance scenes this is slash if you do not like do not read a warning a story of dh hh rp and a few others i do not own harry potter or any of the other stuff i just own this story my four books the movie and my huge anime and manga collection here we go enjoy darkness or light what is your choice chapter  dreams harry woke for the fifth morning in a row drenched with sweat and shaking he lay in his small bed his covers twisted with his feet and stared at the ceiling for a few moments trying to dispel the sick feeling in his stomach he then groped on the side table for his glasses and put them on sitting up he rubbed his forehead over his scar and winced the nightmare wouldnt stop haunting him causing him grief every morning fortunately he hadnt screamed and woken up hermione this time the last four times he had woken up screaming bring in a half asleep and deeply distressed girl in pyjamas hermione had been very helpful from making him try some muggle sleeping tablets for dreamless sleep to trying to make a dreamless sleep potion with her limited supplies hermione had asked him the first two times she had been woken up by his nightmares what he had been dreaming about harry had yet to tell her he had mumbled something about cedric and she had left it alone just holding him in a tight hug against her until harry had drifted off again she was always gone when harry had woken up this time harry wrapped his own arms around himself and rocked himself back and forth gently his dreams had two elements one of them was something he never let himself think about something that made him feel dirty the other was a more normal occurrence in his dreams voldemort only not there was always someone else standing beside the dark lord yelling out instructions in a cold voice a figure who always was standing in darkness and never showed his face voldemort never said a word in this dream it was always this other figure someone familiar in stance but still a stranger this dream had ended slightly different this time instead of the burning agony his scar caused him making him scream outright this time it had been a couple of voices two different statements both with a slightly similar edge they both burned next to his heart you are mine harry potter you will never escape my name or your fate one simple act has changed you destiny you are mine harry potter i love you and will never let you go what ever happens i will always be at your side he didnt understand neither statement made any sense and the whole thing was driving him crazy it was times like these that he wished he could speak to ron he always had an answer either amusing or straight laced but it always made him feel better hermione was a constant worrier making mountains out of molehills it was reassuring for harry sometimes to know someone cared that much about him but at other times it was a slight pain ron was in romania over the summer visiting his brother with the rest of his family hermiones parents had generously invited harry to stay with themselves for the final week of the summer harry had been dubious at first not wanting to subject himself to the torture of hermiones warm up for work regime owls were this year he had changed his mind when hermione had nearly begged him and he thought of getting away from the dursleys although they had been avoiding him like the plague they had still managed to give him a list of chores to do when harry had bought up the name of his godfather when one extraordinary long list had been given to him his uncle had backhanded him into the kitchen table destroying it on impact his uncle had finally decided that he no longer believed his nephew about his convicted godfather and harry had been punished it had taken harry a couple of days to remove all of the splinters from his hands after cleaning up the remains of the table hermione actually hadnt been that bad she had taken out to the town where she lived going to the cinema a few times and going on walks her cat crookshanks actually followed them on these walks scampering after birds and other things even dogs she only picked up her books in the evenings before she went to bed urging harry to do the same hermione spent a lot of her time in harrys company during that week although she hardly eve"
"wow my very first harry potter fan fic i really dont know what you may think of it but i hope in the end you will like it anyway heres some things id like you to know before reading first i am nowhere near being british so i wont even try sounding british second i know voldemort was supposedly creating havoc or something displeasing during this time but i chose not to include him in this fan fic i want world peace he he nah actually i think a mean ol heirofslytherinwhoopenedthechamberofsecrets dont really have a place in my fan fic third what im gonna do with lucius malfoys character in the future might not be pleasing to everyone but look at it this way hes still gonna end up as a git and james and lily will still end up together and fourth i hope youre really familiar with harry potter because im not really good with backstories okay so everything you recognize in this fan fic belongs to whats her name oh yeah jk rowling i think seriously they all belong to jk rowling and im just a fan who wanted to write my own twist however everything else you dont recognize belongs to me so i hope you read and review the words that we say doesnt come out as we planned sometimes theyre just in the way  meja invisible i recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at anytime  alanis morissette you learn  the great hall ceiling reflected the sky of a typical day of autumn closely coming to a close to give way to the cold of winter the hall was peaceful for most part with the usual buzzing of students talking about the day ahead just then as the students were in the middle of their breakfast a seventeenyearold boy banged the door of the hall open the students startled by the sudden noise he made all turned to look at him it was lucius malfoy he looked like he came straight from the shower as his white blond hair was still damp brushed behind his head his gray eyes were as cold as ever and even angrier than the usual as he searched the entirety of the hall the students started cackling altering the quiet atmosphere of the hall into boisterous mirth lucius always had that absolutely pale complexion but that day his skin was perfectly colored red so red it would seem to be that his skin was poured over and covered with blood he fixed his eyes at the people sitting by the front end of the gryffindor table who were completely ignoring the fiasco that was currently happening he marched furiously towards them disregarding the students fits of laughter however occasionally glaring at some of those he passed by he stood sternly by the front end of the table looking at james potter and remus lupin by his left and sirius black and peter pettigrew by his right they were talking animatedly about nonsense when he finally aggravated by their perfect demonstration of lack of awareness of his presence leaned over the table his head blocked james and sirius views of each other with this the hall returned to its quiet surroundings only this time even more silent than from the start he looked straight into james eyes potter he hissed furiously the four gryffindors leaned back then started to laugh lucius stood back up his face still perfectly indifferent good morning malfoy james greeted lucius rather cheerily complete with a wide grin plastered across his face he looked at malfoy for a couple of seconds from head to toe whats the matter you look a little he pursed his lips in mock pity flushed james friends sniggered in amusement this time it was sirius turn to laugh boisterously what shut up you piece of scum lucius hollered at sirius in a split second after sirius opened his mouth his gaze turned back to james who he was pretty sure put the curse on him reverse this bloody curse right now or ill make sure that you will regret this for the rest of your life      while all of these were going on lily evans was eating breakfast with her friends kiara toni and vince they were sitting far enough from james and his cohorts to keep from overhearing their conversation but not too far enough to ignore what was going on by that end of the gryffindor table i dont believe this kiara suddenly spoke out of nowhere making her friends look at her with puzzled expressions on their faces what toni asked lazily as if reading kiaras mind saying ask me what i dont believe kiaras eyes were fixed on james who was arguing with lucius does james look any different to any of you he looks cuter she said turning to her friends for approval toni rolled her eyes or maybe thats because you havent eaten enough breakfast kiara sighed audibly taking no satisfaction from her friends remark she then turned to vince who was sitting in front of her vince alright leave me out of this vince did not even let kiara finish her sentence he raised his hands to stop her and more of to shield himself i am not talking with you about a guys cute piercing eyes wide shoulders or he looked at her in the eyes cute ass im a guy i dont talk about another guy that way all im saying vince ignored "
"disclaimer okay ihr wisst wem die figuren und die orte gehren also rede ich gar nicht erst weiter hallihallo man schon ber einen monat her wo ich das letzte mal diese ff geupdatet habe peinlich aber hier ist jetzt das neuste kapitel viel spa damit dragonis  die wahrheit ber die malfoys untertitel ein kuss und seine folgen rckblick kapitel  hermine nahm schweigsam die karte entgegen sie zeigte einen drachen der einen stab hnlich einer sense in den krallen trug darunter stand das lateinische wort draco du solltest diese karte immer bei dir tragen ich habe nmlich das ungute gefhl das sie dir einmal sehr ntzlich sein wirddamit erhob er sich und ging vom tisch richtung bibliothekseingang zu hermine sprang auf warte du bist nicht der fremde der mich damals ber dem verbotenen wald gerettet hatdas stimmt ich bin nur ein freund der dich hiermit zu mehr vorsicht verwarnt damit drehte er sich um lste das siegel vom eingang und ging hermine blieb allein zurck sie sah schweigsam auf die karte in ihrer hand dann seufzte sie nur langsam drehte sie sich wieder dem tisch zurck ihre bcher welche sie sich rausgesucht hatte lagen noch immer auf ihm sie nahm eins in die hand ein schwarzer drache zierte das cover und in goldenen lettern stand der titel geschrieben sorry aber mir fllt einfach kein origineller titel ein das ist aber nicht so wichtig seufzend ohne zu sprechen sammelte hermine all die bcher auf dem tisch zusammen und drehte sich zu den vielen regalen um langsamen schrittes ging sie an ihnen vorbei ihr blick war nach links gewendet denn geradeaus konnte sie durch die vielen aufgestapelten bcher nicht blicken leider konnte sie dadurch auch die person vor ihr nicht sehen diese hockte vor einem regal und untersuchte die bcherrcken mit seinem zeigefinger anscheinend suchte er ein ganz bestimmtes buch so mit seiner suche beschftigt bemerkte auch er die sich nhernde person nicht erst nachdem ihn etwas an der linken seite berhrte und pltzlich nach rechts umwarf da wurde ihm bewusst das er nicht allein war dann sah man nur noch bcher in die luft fliegen welche dann mit einem unglaublichen radau wieder herunter kamen rumps hermine welche sich durch das hindernis nicht mehr hatte halten knnen lag jetzt auf dem jungen erschrocken sah sie ihr gegenber an und musste mit entsetzen feststellen das sie auf niemand anderem als dem lieblingsschler von professor snape lag draco malfoy na was habt ihr denn gedacht ich mu ja auch mal weiterkommen freudig im kreis rumspring dieser war vllig berrumpelt und sah das junge braunhaarige mdchen an hermine konnte sich nicht rhren sie starrte ihm direkt in seine eisigen leicht geweiteten graublauen augen ihre gesichten berhrten sich fast es fehlten nur noch wenige millimeter was die beiden aber nicht wussten war das sie jemand von der eingangstr her beobachtete okay draco wute es aber irgendwie konnte er gerade keinen klaren gedanken fassen woran liegt das nur  whrenddessen nur einige meter von der bibliothek entfernt  ron und harry gingen zusammen mit ginny von der groen halle zur bibliothek findet ihr nicht auch das hermine sich in letzter zeit irgendwie seltsam benimmtginny zuckte mit den schultern natrlich war ihr das seltsame verhalten von hermine auch schon aufgefallen aber sie hatte es als schulstress abgetan auch harry konnte dazu nichts sagen er ging einfach schweigsam weiter und tat so als htte er die frage nicht gehrt schweigend erreichten sie den gang welcher zur bibliothek jaja ich wiederhole mich vierteilt mich ruhig dafr fhrte am eingang stand mit den rcken zu ihn ein slytherin mit schwarzen kurzen haare er sttzte sich gegen den rahmen der tr und sah um die ecke dann pltzlich drehte er sich weg und lehnte sich beide hnde vor den mund haltend gegen die hauptwand die augen hatte er zusammengekniffen und sein ganzer krper wurde von zuckungen durchgeschttelt man konnte erkennen das die zuckungen durch lachen hervorgerufen wurden welche durch das verkneifen noch verstrkt wurden ginny starrte dem jungem slytherin entgegen sie hatte jetzt wo sie nher rangelaufen waren erkannt das der junge niemand anderes als salazar epans war ihr herz setzte kurz aus und sie zog lautlos die luft ein ron hingegen schob seine unterlippe schmollend nach vorne und schritt dann ohne umschweife auf den slytherin zu harry folgte ihm die einzigste welche sich nicht von der stelle bewegte das war ginny sie stand wie angewurzelt da und starrte salazar epans entgegen warum das konnte sie nicht sagen sie wute auch nicht warum sie dieser slytherin so faszinierte es ging von ihm etwas aus das ginny anzog ron hingegen wollte gerade an ihm vorbei als salazar ihn bemerkte und seinen arm nach vorne streckte durchgangssperresagte dieser ruhig der schwarzhaarige junge vom gegnerischen haus war ernst geworden sein blick ruhte jetzt auf ron in seinen augen konnte man kleine trnen erkennen welche sich durch das lachen gebildet hatten aber sie strten ihn nicht ron hingegen blieb stehen er sah sal an doch dann verengten sich sei"
